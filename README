This is an edition of the four gospels, using the public domain WEB
translation. I use a Python script to pre-process the WEB HTML version, and
then I use Prince (http://www.princexml.com/) to go from HTML/CSS to PDF. The
OSX version of Prince is bundled, so if you clone/download this repo on OSX,
you should be able to run `make` inside it and it will regenerate gospels.pdf
(though it will be up to date when you first check it out).

One issue is that I'm using Adobe Caslon Pro, which is a non-free font. So in
order to actually use this pipeline you need to obtain those fonts and place 
them in a directory called "fonts" under this one.

Another issue is that Lulu chokes on PrinceXML PDFs because of the way fonts
are encoded (Identity-H vs. Custom). The solution I've found is to open the
Prince PDF in Acrobat, save it to PostScript (using the "Acrobat Distiller"
Printer Description File), and then run the *.ps file through Distiller using
Lulu.joboptions. So that's another non-free dependency, if you want to use
Lulu.
