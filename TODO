---DONE---
fix Mark 4:9
fix Matthew 5:6,10
Jesus' apostrophes, John 2:1
fix verse number positioning in poetry (esp. Luke)
    am I really using italic?
    put the adjustments on the dd/dt instead of ... what?
        the idea was to insert shims at the beginning of DT, DD
            but that doesn't easily account for wrapped lines
small caps for first line
    get the height of the cap right
    second line should be indented more than first
    tediously line up second verses in a few spots
        A
        I
        N
        S
        T
