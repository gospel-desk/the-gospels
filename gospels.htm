<SPAN class="chapter">&#xF6DC;</SPAN>The beginning of the Good
News of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-2 verse newline" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>As it is written in the prophets,
<dl>
<dt>Behold, I send my messenger before your face,
<dd>who will prepare your way before you.

crying in the wilderness,

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>John came baptizing in the wilderness and preaching the baptism of
repentance for forgiveness of sins. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>All the country of Judea and all
those of Jerusalem went out to him. They were baptized by him in the
Jordan river, confessing their sins. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>John was clothed with camel&rsquo;s
hair and a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>He preached, saying,
After me comes he who is mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals I
am not worthy to stoop down and loosen. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>I baptized you in water, but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>It happened in those
days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John
in the Jordan. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>Immediately coming up from the
water, he saw the heavens parting, and the Spirit descending on him like a
dove. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>A voice came out of
the sky, You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
<p>Immediately the Spirit
drove him out into the wilderness. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-13 verse range" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF645;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>He was there in the wilderness
forty days tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and the angels
were serving him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>Now after John was
taken into custody, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the Good News of
the Kingdom of God, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>and
saying, The time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God
is at hand! Repent, and believe in the Good News.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>Passing along by the
sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net
into the sea, for they were fishermen. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Jesus said to them, Come after me, and I will make you into fishers for
men.
<p>Immediately they left
their nets, and followed him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-19 verse range" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64B;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Going on a little further from
there, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother, who were
also in the boat mending the nets. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-20 verse newline" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>Immediately he called them, and
they left their father, Zebedee, in the boat with the hired servants, and
went after him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>They went
into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath day he entered into the
synagogue and taught. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>They were astonished at his
teaching, for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-23 verse newline" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>Immediately there was in
their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>saying, Ha! What do we have to
do with you, Jesus, you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know you
who you are: the Holy One of God!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>Jesus rebuked him,
saying, Be quiet, and come out of him!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>The unclean spirit,
convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>They were all amazed, so that
they questioned among themselves, saying, What is this? A new teaching?
For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey
him! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-28 verse newline" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>The report of him
went out immediately everywhere into all the region of Galilee and its
surrounding area.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Immediately, when they
had come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and
Andrew, with James and John. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-30 verse newline" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>Now Simon&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s mother lay
sick with a fever, and immediately they told him about her. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>He came and took her by the hand,
and raised her up. The fever left her, and she served them. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>At evening, when the sun had set,
they brought to him all who were sick, and those who were possessed by
demons. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>All the city was
gathered together at the door. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-34 verse" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>He healed many who were sick with
various diseases, and cast out many demons. He didn&rsquo;t allow the demons
to speak, because they knew him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-35 verse" verse="35">&#xF646;&#xF648;</SPAN>Early in the morning,
while it was still dark, he rose up and went out, and departed into a
deserted place, and prayed there. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-36 verse" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>Simon and those who were with him
followed after him, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-37 verse" verse="37">&#xF646;&#xF64A;</SPAN>and
they found him, and told him, Everyone is looking for you.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-38 verse" verse="38">&#xF646;&#xF64B;</SPAN>He said to them, Let&rsquo;s go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach
there also, because I came out for this reason. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-39 verse" verse="39">&#xF646;&#xF64C;</SPAN>He went into their synagogues
throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-40 verse" verse="40">&#xF647;&#xF643;</SPAN>A leper came to him,
begging him, kneeling down to him, and saying to him, If you want to,
you can make me clean.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-41 verse" verse="41">&#xF647;&#xF644;</SPAN>Being moved with
compassion, he stretched out his hand, and touched him, and said to him,
I want to. Be made clean. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-42 verse" verse="42">&#xF647;&#xF645;</SPAN>When he had said this,
immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-43 verse" verse="43">&#xF647;&#xF646;</SPAN>He strictly warned him, and
immediately sent him out, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-44 verse" verse="44">&#xF647;&#xF647;</SPAN>and said to him, See you say nothing to anybody, but go show yourself to the
priest, and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for
a testimony to them.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-45 verse" verse="45">&#xF647;&#xF648;</SPAN>But he went out, and
began to proclaim it much, and to spread about the matter, so that Jesus
could no more openly enter into a city, but was outside in desert places:
and they came to him from everywhere.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF63A;</SPAN>When he entered again
into Capernaum after some days, it was heard that he was in the house.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>Immediately many were
gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even around the
door, and he spoke the word to them. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>Four people came, carrying a
paralytic to him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>When
they could not come near to him for the crowd, they removed the roof where
he was. When they had broken it up, they let down the mat that the
paralytic was lying on. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>Jesus, seeing their faith, said to
the paralytic, Son, your sins are forgiven
you.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>But there were some of
the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>Why does this man speak
blasphemies like that? Who can forgive sins but God alone?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>Immediately Jesus,
perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, said to
them, Why do you reason these things in your hearts?
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>Which is easier, to tell
the paralytic, Your sins are forgiven, or to say, Arise, and take
up your bed, and walk? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>But that you may know that the
Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins&mdash;he said to
the paralytic&mdash;<SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>I tell you, arise, take up your mat, and go to your
house.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>He arose, and
immediately took up the mat, and went out in front of them all, so that
they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw anything
like this!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>He went out again by
the seaside. All the multitude came to him, and he taught them. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>As he passed by, he saw Levi, the
son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>It happened, that he
was reclining at the table in his house, and many tax collectors and
sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many, and
they followed him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>The
scribes and the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with the
sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, Why is it that he
eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>When Jesus heard it,
he said to them, Those who are healthy have no need for
a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but
sinners to repentance.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>John&rsquo;s disciples and
the Pharisees were fasting, and they came and asked him, Why do
John&rsquo;s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your
disciples don&rsquo;t fast?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Jesus said to them,
Can the groomsmen fast while the bridegroom is with
them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they can&rsquo;t fast.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>But the days will come
when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then will they fast
in that day. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-21 verse newline" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>No one sews
a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, or else the patch shrinks and
the new tears away from the old, and a worse hole is made. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>No one puts new wine into old
wineskins, or else the new wine will burst the skins, and the wine pours
out, and the skins will be destroyed, but they put new wine into fresh
wineskins.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>It happened that he
was going on the Sabbath day through the grain fields, and his disciples
began, as they went, to pluck the ears of grain. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>The Pharisees said to him,
Behold, why do they do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath day?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>He said to them, Did you never read what David did, when he had need, and was
hungry&mdash;he, and those who were with him? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-26 verse newline" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>How he entered into God&rsquo;s house
when Abiathar was high priest, and ate the show bread, which is not lawful
to eat except for the priests, and gave also to those who were with
him? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>He said to
them, The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the
Sabbath. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Therefore the
Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF63B;</SPAN>He entered again into
the synagogue, and there was a man there who had his hand withered.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>They watched him, whether
he would heal him on the Sabbath day, that they might accuse him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>He said to the man who had his
hand withered, Stand up. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>He said to them, Is it lawful on the Sabbath day to do good, or to do harm? To
save a life, or to kill? But they were silent. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>When he had looked around at them
with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their hearts, he said to the
man, Stretch out your hand. He stretched it
out, and his hand was restored as healthy as the other. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>The Pharisees went out, and
immediately conspired with the Herodians against him, how they might
destroy him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>Jesus withdrew to the
sea with his disciples, and a great multitude followed him from Galilee,
from Judea, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>from
Jerusalem, from Idumaea, beyond the Jordan, and those from around Tyre and
Sidon. A great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came to him.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>He spoke to his disciples
that a little boat should stay near him because of the crowd, so that they
wouldn&rsquo;t press on him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>For he had healed many, so that
as many as had diseases pressed on him that they might touch him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>The unclean spirits, whenever
they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, You are the Son of
God! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>He sternly warned
them that they should not make him known.</div><div class="section B"><h2>Section B</h2>
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>He went up into the
mountain, and called to himself those whom he wanted, and they went to
him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>He appointed twelve,
that they might be with him, and that he might send them out to preach,
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>and to have authority to
heal sicknesses and to cast out demons: <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>Simon, to whom he gave the name
Peter, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>James the son of
Zebedee, John, the brother of James, and he surnamed them Boanerges, which
means, Sons of Thunder, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew,
Matthew, Thomas, James, the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot,
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>and Judas Iscariot, who
also betrayed him.
<p>He came into a house. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>The multitude came together
again, so that they could not so much as eat bread. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>When his friends heard it, they
went out to seize him: for they said, He is insane. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>The scribes who came down from
Jerusalem said, He has Beelzebul, and, By the prince of the
demons he casts out the demons.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>He summoned them, and
said to them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>If a kingdom is divided
against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>If a house is divided against
itself, that house cannot stand. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>If Satan has risen up against
himself, and is divided, he can&rsquo;t stand, but has an end. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>But no one can enter into the
house of the strong man to plunder, unless he first binds the strong man,
and then he will plunder his house. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Most certainly I tell you, all
sins of the descendants of man will be forgiven, including their
blasphemies with which they may blaspheme, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>but whoever may blaspheme against
the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal
sin<SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>&mdash;because
they said, He has an unclean spirit.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>His mother and his
brothers came, and standing outside, they sent to him, calling him.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>A multitude was sitting
around him, and they told him, Behold, your mother, your brothers, and
your sisters are outside looking for you.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>He answered them,
Who are my mother and my brothers? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-34 verse newline" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>Looking around at those who sat
around him, he said, Behold, my mother and my brothers!
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-35 verse" verse="35">&#xF646;&#xF648;</SPAN>For whoever does the will
of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF63C;</SPAN>Again he began to teach
by the seaside. A great multitude was gathered to him, so that he entered
into a boat in the sea, and sat down. All the multitude were on the land
by the sea. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>He taught them
many things in parables, and told them in his teaching, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>Listen! Behold,
the farmer went out to sow, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>and it happened, as he sowed, some
seed fell by the road, and the birds came and devoured it. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>Others fell on the rocky ground,
where it had little soil, and immediately it sprang up, because it had no
depth of soil. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>When the
sun had risen, it was scorched, and because it had no root, it withered
away. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>Others fell among
the thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no
fruit. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>Others fell into
the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing. Some
brought forth thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times
as much. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>He said,
Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>When he was alone,
those who were around him with the twelve asked him about the parables.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>He said to them, To you is given the mystery of the Kingdom of God, but to
those who are outside, all things are done in parables, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>that seeing they may see, and
not perceive, and hearing they may hear, and not understand, lest perhaps
they should turn again, and their sins should be forgiven
them.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>He said to them, Don&rsquo;t you understand this parable? How will you understand
all of the parables? The
farmer sows the word. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-15 verse range" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF647;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>The
ones by the road are the ones where the word is sown, and when they have
heard, immediately Satan comes, and takes away the word which has been
sown in them. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>These in
the same way are those who are sown on the rocky places, who, when they
have heard the word, immediately receive it with joy. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>They have no root in themselves,
but are short-lived. When oppression or persecution arises because of the
word, immediately they stumble. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Others are those who are sown
among the thorns. These are those who have heard the word, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>and the cares of this age, and
the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in
choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-20 verse newline" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>Those which were sown on the good
ground are those who hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, some
thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>He said to them, Is the lamp brought to be put under a basket or under a bed? Isn&rsquo;t it put on a stand? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>For there is nothing hidden,
except that it should be made known, neither was anything made secret, but
that it should come to light. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>If any man has ears to hear, let
him hear.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>He said to them, Take heed what you hear. With whatever measure you measure,
it will be measured to you, and more will be given to you who hear.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>For whoever has, to him
will more be given, and he who doesn&rsquo;t have, even that which he has will
be taken away from him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>He said, The Kingdom of God is as if a man should cast seed on the
earth, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>and should sleep
and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he
doesn&rsquo;t know how. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>For
the earth bears fruit: first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain
in the ear. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-29 verse newline" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>But when the
fruit is ripe, immediately he puts forth the sickle, because the harvest
has come.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>He said, How will we liken the Kingdom of God? Or with what parable
will we illustrate it? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>It&rsquo;s like a grain of mustard
seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, though it is less than all the
seeds that are on the earth, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>yet when it is sown, grows up,
and becomes greater than all the herbs, and puts out great branches, so
that the birds of the sky can lodge under its shadow.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>With many such
parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-34 verse" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>Without a parable he didn&rsquo;t
speak to them, but privately to his own disciples he explained everything.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-35 verse" verse="35">&#xF646;&#xF648;</SPAN>On that day, when
evening had come, he said to them, Let&rsquo;s go over to
the other side. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-36 verse" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>Leaving the multitude, they took
him with them, even as he was, in the boat. Other small boats were also
with him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-37 verse" verse="37">&#xF646;&#xF64A;</SPAN>A big wind
storm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so much that the boat was
already filled. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-38 verse" verse="38">&#xF646;&#xF64B;</SPAN>He
himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion, and they woke him up, and
told him, Teacher, don&rsquo;t you care that we are dying?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-39 verse" verse="39">&#xF646;&#xF64C;</SPAN>He awoke, and rebuked
the wind, and said to the sea, Peace! Be
still! The wind ceased, and there was a great calm. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-40 verse" verse="40">&#xF647;&#xF643;</SPAN>He said to them, Why are you so afraid? How is it that you have no
faith?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-41 verse" verse="41">&#xF647;&#xF644;</SPAN>They were greatly
afraid, and said to one another, Who then is this, that even the wind
and the sea obey him?
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF63D;</SPAN>They came to the other
side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>When he had come out of the boat,
immediately a man with an unclean spirit met him out of the tombs. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>He lived in the tombs. Nobody
could bind him any more, not even with chains, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>because he had been often bound
with fetters and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and
the fetters broken in pieces. Nobody had the strength to tame him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>Always, night and day, in the
tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out, and cutting himself with
stones. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>When he saw Jesus
from afar, he ran and bowed down to him, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>and crying out with a loud voice,
he said, What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High
God? I adjure you by God, don&rsquo;t torment me. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>For he said to him, Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>He asked him, What is your name?
<p>He said to him, My name is Legion, for we are many. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>He begged him much that he would
not send them away out of the country. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>Now on the mountainside there was
a great herd of pigs feeding. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>All the demons begged him,
saying, Send us into the pigs, that we may enter into them.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>At once Jesus gave
them permission. The unclean spirits came out and entered into the pigs.
The herd of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea,
and they were drowned in the sea. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>Those who fed them fled, and told
it in the city and in the country.
<p>The people came to see what it was that had happened. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>They came to Jesus, and saw him
who had been possessed by demons sitting, clothed, and in his right mind,
even him who had the legion, and they were afraid. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>Those who saw it declared to them
how it happened to him who was possessed by demons, and about the pigs.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>They began to beg him to
depart from their region.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>As he was entering
into the boat, he who had been possessed by demons begged him that he
might be with him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>He
didn&rsquo;t allow him, but said to him, Go to your house,
to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for
you, and how he had mercy on you.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>He went his way, and
began to proclaim in Decapolis how Jesus had done great things for him,
and everyone marveled.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>When Jesus had crossed
back over in the boat to the other side, a great multitude was gathered to
him, and he was by the sea. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>Behold, one of the rulers of the
synagogue, Jairus by name, came, and seeing him, he fell at his feet,
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>and begged him much,
saying, My little daughter is at the point of death. Please come and
lay your hands on her, that she may be made healthy, and live.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>He went with him, and
a great multitude followed him, and they pressed upon him on all sides.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>A certain woman, who had
an issue of blood for twelve years, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>and had suffered many things by
many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better, but
rather grew worse, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>having
heard the things concerning Jesus, came up behind him in the crowd, and
touched his clothes. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>For
she said, If I just touch his clothes, I will be made well. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Immediately the flow of her blood
was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her
affliction.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>Immediately Jesus,
perceiving in himself that the power had gone out from him, turned around
in the crowd, and asked, Who touched my
clothes?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>His disciples said to
him, You see the multitude pressing against you, and you say, Who
touched me?
<p>He looked around to
see her who had done this thing. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-33 verse range" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF645;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>But the woman, fearing and
trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before
him, and told him all the truth.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-34 verse" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>He said to her, Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be
cured of your disease.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-35 verse" verse="35">&#xF646;&#xF648;</SPAN>While he was still
speaking, people came from the synagogue ruler&rsquo;s house saying, Your
daughter is dead. Why bother the Teacher any more?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-36 verse" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>But Jesus, when he
heard the message spoken, immediately said to the ruler of the synagogue,
Don&rsquo;t be afraid, only believe. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-37 verse" verse="37">&#xF646;&#xF64A;</SPAN>He allowed no one to follow him,
except Peter, James, and John the brother of James. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-38 verse" verse="38">&#xF646;&#xF64B;</SPAN>He came to the synagogue
ruler&rsquo;s house, and he saw an uproar, weeping, and great wailing. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-39 verse" verse="39">&#xF646;&#xF64C;</SPAN>When he had entered in, he said
to them, Why do you make an uproar and weep? The child
is not dead, but is asleep.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-40 verse" verse="40">&#xF647;&#xF643;</SPAN>They ridiculed him.
But he, having put them all out, took the father of the child, her mother,
and those who were with him, and went in where the child was lying.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-41 verse" verse="41">&#xF647;&#xF644;</SPAN>Taking the child by the
hand, he said to her, Talitha cumi! which
means, being interpreted, Girl, I tell you, get
up! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-42 verse" verse="42">&#xF647;&#xF645;</SPAN>Immediately
the girl rose up and walked, for she was twelve years old. They were
amazed with great amazement. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-43 verse" verse="43">&#xF647;&#xF646;</SPAN>He strictly ordered them that no
one should know this, and commanded that something should be given to her
to eat.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF63E;</SPAN>He went out from there.
He came into his own country, and his disciples followed him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>When the Sabbath had come, he
began to teach in the synagogue, and many hearing him were astonished,
saying, Where did this man get these things? and, What is the
wisdom that is given to this man, that such mighty works come about by his
hands? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>Isn&rsquo;t this the
carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James, Joses, Judah, and Simon?
Aren&rsquo;t his sisters here with us? They were offended at him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>Jesus said to them,
A prophet is not without honor, except in his own
country, and among his own relatives, and in his own house.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-5 verse newline" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>He could do no mighty work
there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people, and healed
them. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>He marveled because
of their unbelief.</div><div class="section C"><h2>Section C</h2>
<p>He went around the villages teaching. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>He called to himself the twelve,
and began to send them out two by two, and he gave them authority over the
unclean spirits. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>He
commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, except a
staff only: no bread, no wallet, no money in their purse, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>but to wear sandals, and not put
on two tunics. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>He said to
them, Wherever you enter into a house, stay there until
you depart from there. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>Whoever will not receive you nor
hear you, as you depart from there, shake off the dust that is under your
feet for a testimony against them. Assuredly, I tell you, it will be more
tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that
city!
<p>They went out and
preached that people should repent. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-13 verse range" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF645;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>They cast out many demons, and
anointed many with oil who were sick, and healed them. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>King Herod heard this, for his
name had become known, and he said, John the Baptist has risen from
the dead, and therefore these powers are at work in him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>But others said, He is
Elijah. Others said, He is a prophet, or like one of the
prophets. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>But Herod,
when he heard this, said, This is John, whom I beheaded. He has risen
from the dead. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>For
Herod himself had sent out and arrested John, and bound him in prison for
the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip&rsquo;s wife, for he had married her.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>For John said to Herod,
It is not lawful for you to have your brother&rsquo;s wife. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Herodias set herself against him,
and desired to kill him, but she couldn&rsquo;t, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>for Herod feared John, knowing
that he was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. When he heard
him, he did many things, and he heard him gladly.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>Then a convenient day
came, that Herod on his birthday made a supper for his nobles, the high
officers, and the chief men of Galilee. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>When the daughter of Herodias
herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod and those sitting with him.
The king said to the young lady, Ask me whatever you want, and I will
give it to you. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>He
swore to her, Whatever you shall ask of me, I will give you, up to half
of my kingdom.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>She went out, and said
to her mother, What shall I ask?
<p>She said, The head of John the Baptist.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>She came in
immediately with haste to the king, and asked, I want you to give me
right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>The king was
exceedingly sorry, but for the sake of his oaths, and of his dinner
guests, he didn&rsquo;t wish to refuse her. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Immediately the king sent out a
soldier of his guard, and commanded to bring John&rsquo;s head, and he went
and beheaded him in the prison, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>and brought his head on a
platter, and gave it to the young lady, and the young lady gave it to her
mother.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>When his disciples
heard this, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>The apostles gathered
themselves together to Jesus, and they told him all things, whatever they
had done, and whatever they had taught. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>He said to them, You come apart into a deserted place, and rest

leisure so much as to eat. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>They went away in the boat to a
deserted place by themselves. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>They saw them
going, and many recognized him and ran there on foot from all the cities.
They arrived before them and came together to him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-34 verse" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>Jesus came out, saw a great
multitude, and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep

disciples came to him, and said, This place is deserted, and it is late
in the day. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-36 verse" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>Send them
away, that they may go into the surrounding country and villages, and buy
themselves bread, for they have nothing to eat.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-37 verse" verse="37">&#xF646;&#xF64A;</SPAN>But he answered them,
You give them something to eat.
<p>They asked him, Shall we go and buy two hundred
denarii worth of bread, and give them something to eat?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-38 verse" verse="38">&#xF646;&#xF64B;</SPAN>He said to them, How many loaves do you have? Go see.
<p>When they knew, they said, Five, and two fish.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-39 verse" verse="39">&#xF646;&#xF64C;</SPAN>He commanded them that
everyone should sit down in groups on the green grass. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-40 verse" verse="40">&#xF647;&#xF643;</SPAN>They sat down in ranks, by
hundreds and by fifties. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-41 verse newline" verse="41">&#xF647;&#xF644;</SPAN>He took the five loaves and the
two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke the loaves, and
he gave to his disciples to set before them, and he divided the two fish
among them all. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-42 verse" verse="42">&#xF647;&#xF645;</SPAN>They all
ate, and were filled. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-43 verse" verse="43">&#xF647;&#xF646;</SPAN>They took up twelve baskets full
of broken pieces and also of the fish. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-44 verse" verse="44">&#xF647;&#xF647;</SPAN>Those who ate the loaves
were
five thousand men.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-45 verse" verse="45">&#xF647;&#xF648;</SPAN>Immediately he made
his disciples get into the boat, and to go ahead to the other side, to
Bethsaida, while he himself sent the multitude away. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-46 verse" verse="46">&#xF647;&#xF649;</SPAN>After he had taken leave of them,
he went up the mountain to pray.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-47 verse" verse="47">&#xF647;&#xF64A;</SPAN>When evening had come,
the boat was in the midst of the sea, and he was alone on the land.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-48 verse" verse="48">&#xF647;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Seeing them distressed in
rowing, for the wind was contrary to them, about the fourth watch of the
night he came to them, walking on the sea, and he would have passed by
them, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-49 verse" verse="49">&#xF647;&#xF64C;</SPAN>but they, when they
saw him walking on the sea, supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out,
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-50 verse" verse="50">&#xF648;&#xF643;</SPAN>for they all saw him, and
were troubled. But he immediately spoke with them, and said to them, Cheer up! It is I! Don&rsquo;t be
afraid. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-51 verse" verse="51">&#xF648;&#xF644;</SPAN>He got
into the boat with them, and the wind ceased, and they were very amazed
among themselves, and marveled, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-52 verse" verse="52">&#xF648;&#xF645;</SPAN>for they hadn&rsquo;t understood
about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-53 verse" verse="53">&#xF648;&#xF646;</SPAN>When they had crossed
over, they came to land at Gennesaret, and moored to the shore. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-54 verse" verse="54">&#xF648;&#xF647;</SPAN>When they had come out of the
boat, immediately the people recognized him, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-55 verse" verse="55">&#xF648;&#xF648;</SPAN>and ran around that whole region,
and began to bring those who were sick, on their mats, to where they heard
he was. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-56 verse" verse="56">&#xF648;&#xF649;</SPAN>Wherever he
entered, into villages, or into cities, or into the country, they laid the
sick in the marketplaces, and begged him that they might touch just the fringe of his garment, and as many as touched him were
made well.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF63F;</SPAN>Then the Pharisees, and
some of the scribes gathered together to him, having come from Jerusalem.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>Now when they saw some of
his disciples eating bread with defiled, that is, unwashed, hands, they
found fault. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>(For the
Pharisees, and all the Jews, don&rsquo;t eat unless they wash their hands and
forearms, holding to the tradition of the elders. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>They don&rsquo;t eat when they come
from the marketplace, unless they bathe themselves, and there are many
other things, which they have received to hold to: washings of cups,
pitchers, bronze vessels, and couches.) <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>The Pharisees and the scribes
asked him, Why don&rsquo;t your disciples walk according to the tradition
of the elders, but eat their bread with unwashed hands?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>He answered them, Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written,

<dt>This people honors me with their lips,
<dd>but their heart is far from me.
<dt><SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>But in vain do they
worship me,
<dd>teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.
</dl>
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>For you set aside the
commandment of God, and hold tightly to the tradition of men&mdash;the washing
of pitchers and cups, and you do many other such things. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>He said to them, Full well do you reject the commandment of God, that you may
keep your tradition. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>For
Moses said, Honor your father and your mother, and, He who speaks evil
of father or mother, let him be put to death. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>But you say, If a man tells
his father or his mother, Whatever profit you might have received from
me is Corban, that is to say, given to God,
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>then you no longer allow
him to do anything for his father or his mother, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>making void the word of God by
your tradition, which you have handed down. You do many things like
this.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>He called all the
multitude to himself, and said to them, Hear me, all of
you, and understand. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>There is nothing from outside of
the man, that going into him can defile him, but the things which proceed
out of the man are those that defile the man. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>If anyone has ears to hear, let
him hear!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>When he had entered
into a house away from the multitude, his disciples asked him about the
parable. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>He said to them,
Are you thus without understanding also? Don&rsquo;t you
perceive that whatever goes into the man from outside can&rsquo;t defile him,
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>because it doesn&rsquo;t go
into his heart, but into his stomach, then into the latrine, thus purifying all foods? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>He said, That
which proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>For from within, out of the
hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual sins, murders,
thefts, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>covetings,
wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, and
foolishness. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>All these
evil things come from within, and defile the man.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>From there he arose,
and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. He entered into a house,
and didn&rsquo;t want anyone to know it, but he couldn&rsquo;t escape notice.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>For a woman, whose little
daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at
his feet. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>Now the woman
was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast
the demon out of her daughter. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-27 verse newline" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>But Jesus said to her, Let the children be filled first, for it is not appropriate
to take the children&rsquo;s bread and throw it to the dogs.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>But she answered him,
Yes, Lord. Yet even the dogs under the table eat the children&rsquo;s
crumbs.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>He said to her, For this saying, go your way. The demon has gone out of your
daughter.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>She went away to her
house, and found the child having been laid on the bed, with the demon
gone out.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>Again he departed from
the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and came to the sea of Galilee, through the
midst of the region of Decapolis. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-32 verse newline" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>They brought to him one who was
deaf and had an impediment in his speech. They begged him to lay his hand
on him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>He took him aside
from the multitude, privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he
spat, and touched his tongue. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-34 verse" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>Looking up to heaven, he sighed,
and said to him, Ephphatha! that is, Be opened! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-35 verse newline" verse="35">&#xF646;&#xF648;</SPAN>Immediately his ears were opened,
and the impediment of his tongue was released, and he spoke clearly.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-36 verse" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>He commanded them that
they should tell no one, but the more he commanded them, so much the more
widely they proclaimed it. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-37 verse" verse="37">&#xF646;&#xF64A;</SPAN>They were astonished beyond
measure, saying, He has done all things well. He makes even the deaf
hear, and the mute speak!
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF640;</SPAN>In those days, when
there was a very great multitude, and they had nothing to eat, Jesus
called his disciples to himself, and said to them, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>I have
compassion on the multitude, because they have stayed with me now three
days, and have nothing to eat. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>If I send them away fasting to
their home, they will faint on the way, for some of them have come a long
way.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>His disciples answered
him, From where could one satisfy these people with bread here in a
deserted place?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>He asked them, How many loaves do you have?
<p>They said, Seven.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>He commanded the
multitude to sit down on the ground, and he took the seven loaves. Having
given thanks, he broke them, and gave them to his disciples to serve, and
they served the multitude. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-7 verse newline" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>They had a few small fish. Having
blessed them, he said to serve these also. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>They ate, and were filled. They
took up seven baskets of broken pieces that were left over. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>Those who had eaten were about
four thousand. Then he sent them away.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>Immediately he entered
into the boat with his disciples, and came into the region of Dalmanutha.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>The Pharisees came out
and began to question him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, and
testing him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>He sighed
deeply in his spirit, and said, Why does this generation seek a sign? Most certainly I tell you, no sign
will be given to this generation.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>He left them, and
again entering into the boat, departed to the other side. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>They forgot to take bread, and
they didn&rsquo;t have more than one loaf in the boat with them. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>He warned them, saying, Take heed: beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast
of Herod.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>They reasoned with one
another, saying, It&rsquo;s because we have no bread.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Jesus, perceiving it,
said to them, Why do you reason that it&rsquo;s because you
have no bread? Don&rsquo;t you perceive yet, neither understand? Is your heart
still hardened? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Having
eyes, don&rsquo;t you see? Having ears, don&rsquo;t you hear? Don&rsquo;t you
remember? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>When I broke
the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken
pieces did you take up?
<p>They told him, Twelve.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>When the seven loaves fed the four thousand, how many baskets
full of broken pieces did you take up?
<p>They told him, Seven.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>He asked them, Don&rsquo;t you understand, yet?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>He came to Bethsaida.
They brought a blind man to him, and begged him to touch him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>He took hold of the blind man by
the hand, and brought him out of the village. When he had spit on his
eyes, and laid his hands on him, he asked him if he saw anything.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>He looked up, and
said, I see men, for I see them like trees walking.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>Then again he laid his
hands on his eyes. He looked intently, and was restored, and saw everyone
clearly. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>He sent him away

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Jesus went out, with

his disciples, Who do men say that I am?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>They told him, John

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>He said to them, But who do you say that I am?
<p>Peter answered, You are the Christ.

again. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>He spoke to them

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>Jesus said to him,
If you can believe, all things are possible to him who

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>Immediately the father

out? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>He said to them,
This kind can come out by nothing, except by prayer and

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>They went out from
there, and passed through Galilee. He didn&rsquo;t want anyone to know it.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>For he was teaching his
disciples, and said to them, The Son of Man is being

killed, on the third day he will rise again.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>But they didn&rsquo;t

Teacher, we saw someone who doesn&rsquo;t follow us casting out demons in

<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF6DC;&#xF63A;</SPAN>He began to speak to
them in parables. A man planted a vineyard, put a hedge
around it, dug a pit for the winepress, built a tower, rented it out to a
farmer, and went into another country. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-2 verse newline" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>When it was time, he sent a
servant to the farmer to get from the farmer his share of the fruit of the
vineyard. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>They took him,
beat him, and sent him away empty. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>Again, he sent another servant to

killed him, and many others, beating some, and killing some. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-6 verse newline" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>Therefore still having one, his

said among themselves, This is the heir. Come, let&rsquo;s kill him, and
the inheritance will be ours. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>They took him, killed him, and

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>They tried to seize
him, but they feared the multitude, for they perceived that he spoke the

him, Teacher, we know that you are honest, and don&rsquo;t defer to anyone,
for you aren&rsquo;t partial to anyone, but truly teach the way of God. Is it
lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>Shall we give, or shall we not

Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar&rsquo;s, and to

<p>They marveled greatly at him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>There came to him
Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection. They asked him, saying,
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Teacher, Moses wrote
to us, If a man&rsquo;s brother dies, and leaves a wife behind him, and
leaves no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up
offspring for his brother. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>There were seven brothers. The
first took a wife, and dying left no offspring. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>The second took her, and died,
leaving no children behind him. The third likewise, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>and the seven took her and left
no children. Last of all the woman also died. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>In the resurrection, when they
rise, whose wife will she be of them? For the seven had her as a wife.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>Jesus answered them,
Isn&rsquo;t this because you are mistaken, not knowing the
Scriptures, nor the power of God? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>For when they will rise from the
dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like angels
in heaven. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>But about the
dead, that they are raised, haven&rsquo;t you read in the book of Moses, about
the Bush, how God spoke to him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, the
God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>He is not the God of the dead,
but of the living. You are therefore badly mistaken.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>One of the scribes
came, and heard them questioning together. Knowing that he had answered
them well, asked him, Which commandment is the greatest of all?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Jesus answered, The greatest is, Hear, Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord
is one: <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>you shall love
the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with
all your mind, and with all your strength. This is the first
commandment. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>The second
is like this, You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is no
other commandment greater than these.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>The scribe said to
him, Truly, teacher, you have said well that he is one, and there is
none other but he, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>and
to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, with all
the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as himself,
is more important than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-34 verse" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>When Jesus saw that
he answered wisely, he said to him, You are not far
from the Kingdom of God.
<p>No one dared ask him any question after that. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-35 verse" verse="35">&#xF646;&#xF648;</SPAN>Jesus responded, as he taught in
the temple, How is it that the scribes say that the
Christ is the son of David? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-36 verse" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>For David himself said in the
Holy Spirit,
<dl>
<dt>The Lord said to my Lord,
<dd>Sit at my right hand,
<dd>until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet.
</dl>
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-37 verse" verse="37">&#xF646;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Therefore David himself calls
him Lord, so how can he be his son?
<p>The common people heard him gladly. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-38 verse" verse="38">&#xF646;&#xF64B;</SPAN>In his teaching he said to them,
Beware of the scribes, who like to walk in long robes,
and to get greetings in the marketplaces, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-39 verse" verse="39">&#xF646;&#xF64C;</SPAN>and the best seats in the
synagogues, and the best places at feasts: <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-40 verse" verse="40">&#xF647;&#xF643;</SPAN>those who devour widows
houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. These will receive greater
condemnation.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-41 verse" verse="41">&#xF647;&#xF644;</SPAN>Jesus sat down
opposite the treasury, and saw how the multitude cast money into the
treasury. Many who were rich cast in much. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-42 verse" verse="42">&#xF647;&#xF645;</SPAN>A poor widow came, and she cast
in two small brass coins, which equal a quadrans coin. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-43 verse" verse="43">&#xF647;&#xF646;</SPAN>He called his disciples to
himself, and said to them, Most certainly I tell you,
this poor widow gave more than all those who are giving into the treasury,
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-44 verse" verse="44">&#xF647;&#xF647;</SPAN>for they all gave out of
their abundance, but she, out of her poverty, gave all that she had to
live on.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF6DC;&#xF63B;</SPAN>As he went out of the
temple, one of his disciples said to him, Teacher, see what kind of
stones and what kind of buildings!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>Jesus said to him,
Do you see these great buildings? There will not be
left here one stone on another, which will not be thrown down.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>As he sat on the Mount
of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him
privately, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>Tell us,
when will these things be? What is the sign that these things are all
about to be fulfilled?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>Jesus, answering,
began to tell them, Be careful that no one leads you
astray. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>For many will
come in my name, saying, I am he! and will lead
many astray.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>When you hear of wars and
rumors of wars, don&rsquo;t be troubled. For those must happen, but the end is
not yet. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>For nation will
rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be

will deliver you up to councils. You will be beaten in synagogues. You
will stand before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>The Good News must first
be preached to all the nations. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>When they lead you away and

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>Brother will deliver up

<SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>But when you see the
abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing

had shortened the days, no flesh would have been saved, but for the sake
of the chosen ones, whom he picked out, he shortened the days. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>Then if anyone tells you,

<SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>For there will arise

<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF6DC;&#xF63C;</SPAN>It was now two days

when he had given thanks, he gave to them. They all drank of it. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>He said to them, This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for
many. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>Most certainly I
tell you, I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine, until that day
when I drink it anew in the Kingdom of God. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>When they had sung a hymn, they
went out to the Mount of Olives.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Jesus said to them,
All of you will be made to stumble because of me
tonight, for it is written, I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep
will be scattered. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>However, after I am raised up, I
will go before you into Galilee.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>But Peter said to
him, Although all will be offended, yet I will not.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>Jesus said to him,
Most certainly I tell you, that you today, even this
night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three
times.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>But he spoke all the
more, If I must die with you, I will not deny you. They all said the
same thing.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>They came to a place
which was named Gethsemane. He said to his disciples, Sit here, while I pray. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>He took with him Peter, James,
and John, and began to be greatly troubled and distressed. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-34 verse" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>He said to them, My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here,
and watch.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-35 verse" verse="35">&#xF646;&#xF648;</SPAN>He went forward a
little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the
hour might pass away from him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-36 verse" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>He said, Abba, Father, all things are possible to you. Please remove
this cup from me. However, not what I desire, but what you
desire.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-37 verse" verse="37">&#xF646;&#xF64A;</SPAN>He came and found
them sleeping, and said to Peter, Simon, are you
sleeping? Couldn&rsquo;t you watch one hour? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-38 verse" verse="38">&#xF646;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Watch and pray, that you may not
enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is
weak.
<p>Again he went away,
and prayed, saying the same words. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-40 verse range" verse="40">&#xF646;&#xF64C;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF647;&#xF643;</SPAN>Again he returned, and found
them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy, and they didn&rsquo;t know what
to answer him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-41 verse" verse="41">&#xF647;&#xF644;</SPAN>He came
the third time, and said to them, Sleep on now, and
take your rest. It is enough. The hour has come. Behold, the Son of Man is
betrayed into the hands of sinners. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-42 verse" verse="42">&#xF647;&#xF645;</SPAN>Arise, let us be going. Behold,
he who betrays me is at hand.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-43 verse" verse="43">&#xF647;&#xF646;</SPAN>Immediately, while he
was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, came&mdash;and with him a
multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests, the scribes, and
the elders. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-44 verse" verse="44">&#xF647;&#xF647;</SPAN>Now he who
betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, Whomever I will kiss, that
is he. Seize him, and lead him away safely. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-45 verse" verse="45">&#xF647;&#xF648;</SPAN>When he had come, immediately he
came to him, and said, Rabbi! Rabbi! and kissed him. They laid their hands on him,
and seized him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-47 verse range" verse="47">&#xF647;&#xF649;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF647;&#xF64A;</SPAN>But a
certain one of those who stood by drew his sword, and struck the servant
of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-48 verse" verse="48">&#xF647;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Jesus answered them,
Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and
clubs to seize me? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-49 verse" verse="49">&#xF647;&#xF64C;</SPAN>I was
daily with you in the temple teaching, and you didn&rsquo;t arrest me. But
this is so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled.
<p>They all left him,
and fled. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-51 verse range" verse="51">&#xF648;&#xF643;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF648;&#xF644;</SPAN>A certain
young man followed him, having a linen cloth thrown around himself, over
his naked body. The young men grabbed him, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-52 verse" verse="52">&#xF648;&#xF645;</SPAN>but he left the linen cloth, and
fled from them naked. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-53 verse" verse="53">&#xF648;&#xF646;</SPAN>They led Jesus away to the high
priest. All the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes came together
with him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-54 verse" verse="54">&#xF648;&#xF647;</SPAN>Peter had followed
him from a distance, until he came into the court of the high priest. He
was sitting with the officers, and warming himself in the light of the
fire. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-55 verse" verse="55">&#xF648;&#xF648;</SPAN>Now the chief
priests and the whole council sought witnesses against Jesus to put him to
death, and found none. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-56 verse" verse="56">&#xF648;&#xF649;</SPAN>For many gave false testimony
against him, and their testimony didn&rsquo;t agree with each other. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-57 verse" verse="57">&#xF648;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Some stood up, and gave false
testimony against him, saying, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-58 verse" verse="58">&#xF648;&#xF64B;</SPAN>We heard him say, I will
destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will
build another made without hands. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-59 verse" verse="59">&#xF648;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Even so, their testimony did not
agree.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-60 verse" verse="60">&#xF649;&#xF643;</SPAN>The high priest stood
up in the midst, and asked Jesus, Have you no answer? What is it which
these testify against you? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-61 verse" verse="61">&#xF649;&#xF644;</SPAN>But he stayed quiet, and
answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, Are you the Christ,
the Son of the Blessed?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-62 verse" verse="62">&#xF649;&#xF645;</SPAN>Jesus said, I am. You will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand
of Power, and coming with the clouds of the sky.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-63 verse" verse="63">&#xF649;&#xF646;</SPAN>The high priest tore
his clothes, and said, What further need have we of witnesses? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-64 verse" verse="64">&#xF649;&#xF647;</SPAN>You have heard the blasphemy!
What do you think? They all condemned him to be worthy of death.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-65 verse" verse="65">&#xF649;&#xF648;</SPAN>Some began to spit on
him, and to cover his face, and to beat him with fists, and to tell him,
Prophesy! The officers struck him with the palms of their hands.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-66 verse" verse="66">&#xF649;&#xF649;</SPAN>As Peter was in the
courtyard below, one of the maids of the high priest came, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-67 verse" verse="67">&#xF649;&#xF64A;</SPAN>and seeing Peter warming
himself, she looked at him, and said, You were also with the Nazarene,
Jesus!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-68 verse" verse="68">&#xF649;&#xF64B;</SPAN>But he denied it,
saying, I neither know, nor understand what you are saying. He went
out on the porch, and the rooster crowed.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-69 verse" verse="69">&#xF649;&#xF64C;</SPAN>The maid saw him, and
began again to tell those who stood by, This is one of them. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-70 verse" verse="70">&#xF64A;&#xF643;</SPAN>But he again denied it. After a
little while again those who stood by said to Peter, You truly are one
of them, for you are a Galilean, and your speech shows it. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-71 verse" verse="71">&#xF64A;&#xF644;</SPAN>But he began to curse, and to
swear, I don&rsquo;t know this man of whom you speak! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-72 verse" verse="72">&#xF64A;&#xF645;</SPAN>The rooster crowed the second
time. Peter remembered the word, how that Jesus said to him, Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three
times. When he thought about that, he wept.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF6DC;&#xF63D;</SPAN>Immediately in the
morning the chief priests, with the elders and scribes, and the whole
council, held a consultation, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and
delivered him up to Pilate. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>Pilate asked him, Are you the
King of the Jews?
<p>He answered, So you say.
<p>The chief priests
accused him of many things. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-4 verse range" verse="4">&#xF646;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF647;</SPAN>Pilate again asked him, Have
you no answer? See how many things they testify against you!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>But Jesus made no
further answer, so that Pilate marveled.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>Now at the feast he
used to release to them one prisoner, whom they asked of him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>There was one called Barabbas,
bound with those who had made insurrection, men who in the insurrection
had committed murder. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>The
multitude, crying aloud, began to ask him to do as he always did for them.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>Pilate answered them,
saying, Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>For he perceived that
for envy the chief priests had delivered him up. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>But the chief priests stirred up
the multitude, that he should release Barabbas to them instead. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>Pilate again asked them, What
then should I do to him whom you call the King of the Jews?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>They cried out again,
Crucify him!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>Pilate said to them,
Why, what evil has he done?
<p>But they cried out exceedingly, Crucify him!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>Pilate, wishing to
please the multitude, released Barabbas to them, and handed over Jesus,
when he had flogged him, to be crucified. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>The soldiers led him away within
the court, which is the Praetorium, and they called together the whole
cohort. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>They clothed him
with purple, and weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on him. They began to salute him,
Hail, King of the Jews! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-19 verse range" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64B;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>They struck his head with a
reed, and spat on him, and bowing their knees, did homage to him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>When they had mocked him, they
took the purple off of him, and put his own garments on him. They led him
out to crucify him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>They
compelled one passing by, coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene, the
father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them, that he might bear his
cross. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>They brought him
to the place called Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of
a skull. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>They offered
him wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but he didn&rsquo;t take it.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>Crucifying him, they
parted his garments among them, casting lots on them, what each should
take. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>It was the third hour, and they crucified him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>The superscription of his
accusation was written over him, THE KING OF THE JEWS. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>With him they crucified two
robbers, one on his right hand, and one on his left. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>The Scripture was
fulfilled, which says, He was numbered with transgressors.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Those who passed by
blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ha! You who destroy
the temple, and build it in three days, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>save yourself, and come down
from the cross!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>Likewise, also the
chief priests mocking among themselves with the scribes said, He saved
others. He can&rsquo;t save himself. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>Let the Christ, the King of
Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe him. Those who were crucified with him insulted him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>When the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole
land until the ninth hour. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-34 verse" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>At the ninth hour Jesus cried
with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama
sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My
God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-35 verse" verse="35">&#xF646;&#xF648;</SPAN>Some of those who
stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he is calling Elijah.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-36 verse" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>One ran, and filling
a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink,
saying, Let him be. Let&rsquo;s see whether Elijah comes to take him
down.
<p>Jesus cried out with
a loud voice, and gave up the spirit. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-38 verse range" verse="38">&#xF646;&#xF64A;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF646;&#xF64B;</SPAN>The veil of the temple was torn
in two from the top to the bottom. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-39 verse" verse="39">&#xF646;&#xF64C;</SPAN>When the centurion, who stood by
opposite him, saw that he cried out like this and breathed his last, he
said, Truly this man was the Son of God!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-40 verse" verse="40">&#xF647;&#xF643;</SPAN>There were also women
watching from afar, among whom were both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the
mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-41 verse" verse="41">&#xF647;&#xF644;</SPAN>who, when he was in Galilee,
followed him, and served him, and many other women who came up with him to
Jerusalem.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-42 verse" verse="42">&#xF647;&#xF645;</SPAN>When evening had now
come, because it was the Preparation Day, that is, the day before the
Sabbath, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-43 verse" verse="43">&#xF647;&#xF646;</SPAN>Joseph of
Arimathaea, a prominent council member who also himself was looking for
the Kingdom of God, came. He boldly went in to Pilate, and asked for
Jesus body. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-44 verse" verse="44">&#xF647;&#xF647;</SPAN>Pilate
marveled if he were already dead, and summoning the centurion, he asked
him whether he had been dead long. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-45 verse" verse="45">&#xF647;&#xF648;</SPAN>When he found out from the
centurion, he granted the body to Joseph. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-46 verse" verse="46">&#xF647;&#xF649;</SPAN>He bought a linen cloth, and
taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb
which had been cut out of a rock. He rolled a stone against the door of
the tomb. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-47 verse" verse="47">&#xF647;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Mary Magdalene
and Mary, the mother of Joses, saw where he was laid.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF6DC;&#xF63E;</SPAN>When the Sabbath was
past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought
spices, that they might come and anoint him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>Very early on the first day of
the week, they came to the tomb when the sun had risen. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>They were saying among
themselves, Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for
us? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>for it was very
big. Looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled back.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>Entering into the
tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white
robe, and they were amazed. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>He said to them, Don&rsquo;t be
amazed. You seek Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He has
risen. He is not here. Behold, the place where they laid him! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>But go, tell his disciples and
Peter, He goes before you into Galilee. There you will see him, as he
said to you.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>They went out, and fled
from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had come on them. They said
nothing to anyone, for they were afraid. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN>

<SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>But when he saw many of

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>It was also said, Whoever

who was paralyzed, lying on a bed. Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the
paralytic, Son, cheer up! Your sins are forgiven
you.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>Behold, some of the
scribes said to themselves, This man blasphemes.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>Jesus, knowing their
thoughts, said, Why do you think evil in your hearts?
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>For which is easier, to
say, Your sins are forgiven, or to say, Get up, and walk?
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>But that you may know that
the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins... (then
he said to the paralytic), Get up, and take up your
mat, and go up to your house.
<p>He arose and departed
to his house. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-8 verse range" verse="8">&#xF64A;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF64B;</SPAN>But when the
multitudes saw it, they marveled and glorified God, who had given such
authority to men.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>As Jesus passed by from
there, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax collection office.
He said to him, Follow me. He got up and
followed him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>It happened
as he sat in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and
sat down with Jesus and his disciples. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>When the Pharisees saw it, they
said to his disciples, Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors
and sinners?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>When Jesus heard it,
he said to them, Those who are healthy have no need for
a physician, but those who are sick do. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>But you go and learn what this
means: I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, for I came not to call the
righteous, but sinners to repentance.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>Then John&rsquo;s
disciples came to him, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast often,
but your disciples don&rsquo;t fast?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>Jesus said to them,
Can the friends of the bridegroom mourn, as long as the
bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will
be taken away from them, and then they will fast. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>No one puts a piece of unshrunk
cloth on an old garment, for the patch would tear away from the garment,
and a worse hole is made. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Neither do people put new wine
into old wineskins, or else the skins would burst, and the wine be
spilled, and the skins ruined. No, they put new wine into fresh wineskins,
and both are preserved.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>While he told these
things to them, behold, a ruler came and worshiped him, saying, My
daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her, and she will
live.
<p>Jesus got up and
followed him, as did his disciples. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-20 verse range" verse="20">&#xF644;&#xF64C;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>Behold, a woman who had an issue
of blood for twelve years came behind him, and touched the fringe of his garment, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>for she said within herself,
If I just touch his garment, I will be made well.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>But Jesus, turning
around and seeing her, said, Daughter, cheer up! Your
faith has made you well. And the woman was made well from that
hour.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>When Jesus came into
the ruler&rsquo;s house, and saw the flute players, and the crowd in noisy
disorder, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>he said to
them, Make room, because the girl isn&rsquo;t dead, but
sleeping.
<p>They were ridiculing him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>But when the crowd was put out,
he entered in, took her by the hand, and the girl arose. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>The report of this went out into
all that land. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>As Jesus
passed by from there, two blind men followed him, calling out and saying,
Have mercy on us, son of David!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>When he had come into
the house, the blind men came to him. Jesus said to them, Do you believe that I am able to do this?
<p>They told him, Yes, Lord.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Then he touched their
eyes, saying, According to your faith be it done to
you. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>Their eyes
were opened. Jesus strictly commanded them, saying, See
that no one knows about this. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>But they went out and spread
abroad his fame in all that land.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>As they went out,
behold, a mute man who was demon possessed was brought to him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>When the demon was cast out, the
mute man spoke. The multitudes marveled, saying, Nothing like this has
ever been seen in Israel!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-34 verse" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>But the Pharisees
said, By the prince of the demons, he casts out demons.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-35 verse" verse="35">&#xF646;&#xF648;</SPAN>Jesus went about all
the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching
the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness
among the people. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-36 verse" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>But
when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion for them, because
they were harassed and scattered, like sheep without a
shepherd. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-37 verse" verse="37">&#xF646;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Then he said to
his disciples, The harvest indeed is plentiful, but the
laborers are few. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-38 verse" verse="38">&#xF646;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Pray
therefore that the Lord of the harvest will send out laborers into his
harvest.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF6DC;&#xF639;</SPAN>He called to himself
his twelve disciples, and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to
cast them out, and to heal every disease and every sickness. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>Now the names of the twelve
apostles are these. The first, Simon, who is called Peter, Andrew, his

Matthew the tax collector, James the son of Alphaeus, Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>Simon the Canaanite, and Judas
Iscariot, who also betrayed him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>Jesus sent these
twelve out, and commanded them, saying, Don&rsquo;t go
among the Gentiles, and don&rsquo;t enter into any city of the Samaritans.
Rather, go to the lost
sheep of the house of Israel. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-7 verse range" verse="7">&#xF649;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF64A;</SPAN>As you go, preach, saying, The
Kingdom of Heaven is at hand! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>Heal the sick, cleanse the
lepers, and cast out demons. Freely you received,
so freely give. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>Don&rsquo;t
take any gold, nor silver, nor brass in your money belts. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>Take no bag for your journey,
neither two coats, nor shoes, nor staff: for the laborer is worthy of his
food. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>Into whatever city
or village you enter, find out who in it is worthy, and stay there until
you go on. As you enter
into the household, greet it. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-13 verse range" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF645;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>If the household is worthy, let
your peace come on it, but if it isn&rsquo;t worthy, let your peace return to
you. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>Whoever doesn&rsquo;t
receive you, nor hear your words, as you go out of that house or that
city, shake off the dust from your feet. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>Most certainly I tell you, it
will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of
judgment than for that city.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>Behold, I send you out as
sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents, and harmless
as doves. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>But beware of
men: for they will deliver you up to councils, and in their synagogues
they will scourge you. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Yes, and you will be brought
before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the
nations. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>But when they
deliver you up, don&rsquo;t be anxious how or what you will say, for it will
be given you in that hour what you will say. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>For it is not you who speak, but
the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>Brother will deliver up

this city, flee into the next, for most certainly I tell you, you will not

<p>A disciple is not above his

that he be like his teacher, and the servant like his lord. If they have
called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more those of his
household! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>Therefore
don&rsquo;t be afraid of them, for there is nothing covered that will not be

be afraid of those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul.

<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF6DC;&#xF6DC;</SPAN>It happened that when
Jesus had finished directing his twelve disciples, he departed from there
to teach and preach in their cities.</div><div class="section E"><h2>Section E</h2> <p> <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>Now when John heard in the prison
the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>and said to him, Are you he
who comes, or should we look for another?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>Jesus answered them,
Go and tell John the things which you hear and see:
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>the blind receive their
sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead
are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>Blessed is he who finds no
occasion for stumbling in me.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>As these went their
way, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John, What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken
by the wind? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>But what did
you go out to see? A man in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft
clothing are in king&rsquo;s houses. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>But why did you go out? To see a
prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>For this is he, of whom it is
written, Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare
your way before you. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>Most certainly I tell you, among
those who are born of women there has not arisen anyone greater than John
the Baptist, yet he who is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than
he. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>From the days of
John the Baptist until now, the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence, and
the violent take it by force. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>For all the prophets and the law
prophesied until John. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>If you are willing to receive

hear.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>But to what shall I compare
this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces, who call
to their companions <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>and
say, We played the flute for you, and you didn&rsquo;t dance. We mourned
for you, and you didn&rsquo;t lament. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>For John came neither eating nor
drinking, and they say, He has a demon. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>The Son of Man came eating and
drinking, and they say, Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>Then he began to
denounce the cities in which most of his mighty works had been done,
because they didn&rsquo;t repent. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>Woe to you,
Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in
Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago
in sackcloth and ashes. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>But I tell you, it will be more
tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>You, Capernaum, who are exalted
to heaven, you will go down to Hades. For if the mighty
works had been done in Sodom which were done in you, it would have
remained until this day. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>But I tell you that it will be
more tolerable for the land of Sodom, on the day of judgment, than for
you.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>At that time, Jesus
answered, I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and
earth, that you hid these things from the wise and understanding, and
revealed them to infants. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>Yes, Father, for so it was
well-pleasing in your sight. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>All things have been delivered
to me by my Father. No one knows the Son, except the Father, neither does
anyone know the Father, except the Son, and he to whom the Son desires to
reveal him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Come to me, all you who labor
and are heavily burdened, and I will give you rest. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Take my yoke upon you, and learn
from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for
your souls. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>For my yoke
is easy, and my burden is light.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF6DC;&#xF63A;</SPAN>At that time, Jesus
went on the Sabbath day through the grain fields. His disciples were
hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>But the Pharisees, when they saw
it, said to him, Behold, your disciples do what is not lawful to do on
the Sabbath.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>But he said to them,
Haven&rsquo;t you read what David did, when he was hungry,

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>But he said, No, lest

them. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>Let both grow
together until the harvest, and in the harvest time I will tell the

burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>He set another

<SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>which indeed is smaller

He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-38 verse" verse="38">&#xF646;&#xF64B;</SPAN>the field is the world, and the
good seed, these are the children of the Kingdom, and the darnel weeds are
the children of the evil one. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-39 verse" verse="39">&#xF646;&#xF64C;</SPAN>The enemy who sowed them is the
devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-40 verse" verse="40">&#xF647;&#xF643;</SPAN>As therefore the darnel

the tetrarch heard the report concerning Jesus, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-2 verse newline" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>and said to his servants, This
is John the Baptist. He is risen from the dead. That is why these powers
work in him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>For Herod
had laid hold of John, and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake
of Herodias, his brother Philip&rsquo;s wife. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>For John said to him, It is
not lawful for you to have her. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>When he would have put him to
death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>But when Herod&rsquo;s
birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced among them and pleased
Herod. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>Whereupon he
promised with an oath to give her whatever she should ask. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>She, being prompted by her
mother, said, Give me here on a platter the head of John the
Baptist.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>The king was grieved,
but for the sake of his oaths, and of those who sat at the table with him,
he commanded it to be given, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>and he sent and beheaded John in
the prison. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>His head was
brought on a platter, and given to the young lady: and she brought it to
her mother. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>His
disciples came, and took the body, and buried it, and they went and told
Jesus. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>Now when Jesus
heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat, to a deserted place apart.
When the multitudes heard it, they followed him on foot from the cities.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>Jesus went out, and
he saw a great multitude. He had compassion on them, and healed their
sick. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>When evening had
come, his disciples came to him, saying, This place is deserted, and
the hour is already late. Send the multitudes away, that they may go into
the villages, and buy themselves food.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>But Jesus said to
them, They don&rsquo;t need to go away. You give them
something to eat.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>They told him, We
only have here five loaves and two fish.
<p>He said, Bring them here to me. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-19 verse range" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64B;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>He commanded the multitudes to
sit down on the grass, and he took the five loaves and the two fish, and
looking up to heaven, he blessed, broke and gave the loaves to the
disciples, and the disciples gave to the multitudes. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>They all ate, and were filled.
They took up twelve baskets full of that which remained left over from the
broken pieces. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>Those who
ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>Immediately Jesus
made the disciples get into the boat, and to go ahead of him to the other
side, while he sent the multitudes away. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-23 verse newline" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>After he had sent the multitudes
away, he went up into the mountain by himself to pray. When evening had
come, he was there alone. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>But the boat was now in the
middle of the sea, distressed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>In the
fourth watch of the night, Jesus came to them, walking on the
sea.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>When the disciples saw
him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It&rsquo;s a ghost!
and they cried out for fear. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>But immediately Jesus spoke to
them, saying Cheer up! It is I!
Don&rsquo;t be afraid.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Peter answered him
and said, Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the
waters.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>He said, Come!
<p>Peter stepped down from the boat, and walked on the waters to come to
Jesus. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>But when he saw
that the wind was strong, he was afraid, and beginning to sink, he cried
out, saying, Lord, save me!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>Immediately Jesus
stretched out his hand, took hold of him, and said to him, You of little faith, why did you doubt? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>When they got up into the boat,
the wind ceased. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>Those
who were in the boat came and worshiped him, saying, You are truly the
Son of God!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-34 verse" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>When they had crossed
over, they came to the land of Gennesaret. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-35 verse" verse="35">&#xF646;&#xF648;</SPAN>When the people of that place
recognized him, they sent into all that surrounding region, and brought to
him all who were sick, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-36 verse" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>and they begged him that they
might just touch the fringe of his garment. As many as
touched it were made whole.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF6DC;&#xF63D;</SPAN>Then Pharisees and
scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-2 verse newline" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>Why do your disciples disobey
the tradition of the elders? For they don&rsquo;t wash their hands when they
eat bread.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>He answered them,
Why do you also disobey the commandment of God because
of your tradition? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>For
God commanded, Honor your father and your mother, and, He
who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>But you say, Whoever may tell
his father or his mother, Whatever help you might otherwise have gotten
from me is a gift devoted to God, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>he shall not honor his father or
mother. You have made the commandment of God void because of your
tradition. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>You
hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,
<dl>
<dt><SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>These people draw
near to me with their mouth,
<dd>and honor me with their lips,
<dd>but their heart is far from me.
<dt><SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>And in vain do they
worship me,
<dd>teaching as doctrine rules made by men.
</dl>
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>He summoned the
multitude, and said to them, Hear, and understand.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>That which enters into
the mouth doesn&rsquo;t defile the man, but that which proceeds out of the
mouth, this defiles the man.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>Then the disciples
came, and said to him, Do you know that the Pharisees were offended,
when they heard this saying?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>But he answered,
Every plant which my heavenly Father didn&rsquo;t plant
will be uprooted. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>Leave
them alone. They are blind guides of the blind. If the blind guide the
blind, both will fall into a pit.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>Peter answered him,
Explain the parable to us.
<p>So Jesus said, Do you also still not understand? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-17 verse range" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF649;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Don&rsquo;t you understand that
whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly, and then out of the
body? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>But the things
which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart, and they defile the
man. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>For out of the
heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual sins, thefts,
false testimony, and blasphemies. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>These are the things which
defile the man, but to eat with unwashed hands doesn&rsquo;t defile the
man.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>Jesus went out from
there, and withdrew into the region of Tyre and Sidon. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>Behold, a Canaanite woman came
out from those borders, and cried, saying, Have mercy on me, Lord, you
son of David! My daughter is severely demonized!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>But he answered her
not a word.
<p>His disciples came and begged him, saying, Send her away, for she
cries after us.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>But he answered,
I wasn&rsquo;t sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the
house of Israel.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>But she came and
worshiped him, saying, Lord, help me.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>But he answered,
It is not appropriate to take the children&rsquo;s bread
and throw it to the dogs.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>But she said, Yes,
Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters
table.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Then Jesus answered
her, Woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you even
as you desire. And her daughter was healed from that hour.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Jesus departed there,
and came near to the sea of Galilee, and he went up into the mountain, and
sat there. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>Great
multitudes came to him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed,
and many others, and they put them down at his feet. He healed them,
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>so that the multitude
wondered when they saw the mute speaking, injured whole, lame walking, and
blind seeing&mdash;and they glorified the God of Israel.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>Jesus summoned his
disciples and said, I have compassion on the multitude,
because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat. I
don&rsquo;t want to send them away fasting, or they might faint on the
way.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>The disciples said to
him, Where should we get so many loaves in a deserted place as to
satisfy so great a multitude?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-34 verse" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>Jesus said to them,
How many loaves do you have?
<p>They said, Seven, and a few small fish.
<p>He commanded the
multitude to sit down on the ground, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-36 verse range" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF648;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>and he took the seven loaves and
the fish. He gave thanks and broke them, and gave to the disciples, and
the disciples to the multitudes. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-37 verse" verse="37">&#xF646;&#xF64A;</SPAN>They all ate, and were filled.
They took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-38 verse" verse="38">&#xF646;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Those who ate were four
thousand men, besides women and children. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-39 verse" verse="39">&#xF646;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Then he sent away the
multitudes, got into the boat, and came into the borders of Magdala.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF6DC;&#xF63E;</SPAN>The Pharisees and
Sadducees came, and testing him, asked him to show them a sign from
heaven. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>But he answered
them, When it is evening, you say, It will be fair
weather, for the sky is red. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>In the morning, It will be
foul weather today, for the sky is red and threatening. Hypocrites! You
know how to discern the appearance of the sky, but you can&rsquo;t discern the
signs of the times! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>An
evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and there will be no
sign given to it, except the sign of the prophet Jonah.
<p>He left them, and departed. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>The disciples came to the other
side and had forgotten to take bread. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>Jesus said to them, Take heed and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and
Sadducees.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>They reasoned among
themselves, saying, We brought no bread.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>Jesus, perceiving it,
said, Why do you reason among yourselves, you of little
faith, because you have brought no bread? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>Don&rsquo;t you yet perceive, neither
remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you
took up? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>Nor the seven
loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you took up? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>How is it that you don&rsquo;t
perceive that I didn&rsquo;t speak to you concerning bread? But beware of the
yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>Then they understood
that he didn&rsquo;t tell them to beware of the yeast of bread, but of the
teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-13 verse newline" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>Now when Jesus came into the
parts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>They said, Some
say John the Baptist, some, Elijah, and others, Jeremiah, or one of the
prophets.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>He said to them,
But who do you say that I am?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>Simon Peter answered,
You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Jesus answered him,
Blessed are you, Simon Bar Jonah, for flesh and blood
has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>I also tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my
assembly, and the gates of Hades will not prevail
against it. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>I will give
to you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and whatever you bind on earth
will have been bound in heaven, and whatever you release on earth will
have been released in heaven. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>Then he commanded the disciples
that they should tell no one that he was Jesus the Christ. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>From that time, Jesus began to
show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things
from the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and the third
day be raised up.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>Peter took him aside,
and began to rebuke him, saying, Far be it from you, Lord! This will
never be done to you.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>But he turned, and
said to Peter, Get behind me, Satan! You are a
stumbling block to me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of
God, but on the things of men. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>Then Jesus said to his
disciples, If anyone desires to come after me, let him
deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>For whoever desires to save his
life will lose it, and whoever will lose his life for my sake will find
it. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>For what will it
profit a man, if he gains the whole world, and forfeits his life? Or what
will a man give in exchange for his life? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>For the Son of Man will come in
the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will render to
everyone according to his deeds. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Most certainly I tell you, there
are some standing here who will in no way taste of death, until they see
the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF6DC;&#xF63F;</SPAN>After six days, Jesus
took with him Peter, James, and John his brother, and brought them up into
a high mountain by themselves. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-2 verse newline" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>He was transfigured before them.
His face shone like the sun, and his garments became as white as the
light. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>Behold, Moses and
Elijah appeared to them talking with him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>Peter answered, and
said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you want, let&rsquo;s
make three tents here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>While he was still
speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. Behold, a voice came
out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well
pleased. Listen to him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>When the disciples
heard it, they fell on their faces, and were very afraid. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>Jesus came and touched them and
said, Get up, and don&rsquo;t be afraid. Lifting up their eyes, they saw
no one, except Jesus alone. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-9 verse range" verse="9">&#xF64B;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF64C;</SPAN>As they were coming down from the
mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, Don&rsquo;t tell
anyone what you saw, until the Son of Man has risen from the
dead.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>His disciples asked
him, saying, Then why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>Jesus answered them,
Elijah indeed comes first, and will restore all things,
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>but I tell you that
Elijah has come already, and they didn&rsquo;t recognize him, but did to him
whatever they wanted to. Even so the Son of Man will also suffer by
them. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>Then the
disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the Baptist.</div><div class="section H"><h2>Section H</h2>
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>When they came to the
multitude, a man came to him, kneeling down to him, saying, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>Lord, have mercy on my son,
for he is epileptic, and suffers grievously, for he often falls into the
fire, and often into the water. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>So I brought him to your
disciples, and they could not cure him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Jesus answered, Faithless and perverse generation! How long will I be with
you? How long will I bear with you? Bring him here to me.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Jesus rebuked him, the
demon went out of him, and the boy was cured from that hour.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Then the disciples
came to Jesus privately, and said, Why weren&rsquo;t we able to cast it
out?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>He said to them,
Because of your unbelief. For most certainly I tell
you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will tell this
mountain, Move from here to there, and it will move, and nothing
will be impossible for you. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>But this kind doesn&rsquo;t go out
except by prayer and fasting.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>While they were
staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of Man
is about to be delivered up into the hands of men, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>and they will kill him, and the
third day he will be raised up.
<p>They were exceedingly sorry. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>When they had come to Capernaum,
those who collected the didrachma coins came to Peter,
and said, Doesn&rsquo;t your teacher pay the didrachma? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>He said, Yes.
<p>When he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth
receive toll or tribute? From their children, or from strangers?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>Peter said to him,
From strangers.
<p>Jesus said to him, Therefore the children are
exempt. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>But, lest we
cause them to stumble, go to the sea, cast a hook, and take up the first
fish that comes up. When you have opened its mouth, you will find a stater coin. Take that, and give it to them for me and
you.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF6DC;&#xF640;</SPAN>In that hour the
disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who then is greatest in the Kingdom of
Heaven?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>Jesus called a little
child to himself, and set him in their midst, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-3 verse newline" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>and said, Most
certainly I tell you, unless you turn, and become as little children, you
will in no way enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>Whoever therefore humbles himself
as this little child, the same is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>Whoever receives one such
little child in my name receives me, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>but whoever causes one of these
little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him that
a huge millstone should be hung around his neck, and that he should be
sunk in the depths of the sea.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>Woe to the world because of
occasions of stumbling! For it must be that the occasions come, but woe to
that person through whom the occasion comes! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>If your hand or your foot causes
you to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from you. It is better for you to
enter into life maimed or crippled, rather than having two hands or two
feet to be cast into the eternal fire. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>If your eye causes you to
stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter
into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna of fire. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>See that you don&rsquo;t despise one
of these little ones, for I tell you that in heaven their angels always
see the face of my Father who is in heaven. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>For the Son of Man came to save
that which was lost.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>What do you think? If a man
has one hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, doesn&rsquo;t he leave the
ninety-nine, go to the mountains, and seek that which has gone astray?
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>If he finds it, most
certainly I tell you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine
which have not gone astray. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>Even so it is not the will of
your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>If your brother sins against
you, go, show him his fault between you and him alone. If he listens to
you, you have gained back your brother. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>But if he doesn&rsquo;t listen, take
one or two more with you, that at the mouth of two or three witnesses
every word may be established. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>If he refuses to listen to them,
tell it to the assembly. If he refuses to hear the assembly also, let him
be to you as a Gentile or a tax collector. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Most certainly I tell you,
whatever things you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven, and
whatever things you release on earth will have been released in heaven.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Again, assuredly I tell
you, that if two of you will agree on earth concerning anything that they
will ask, it will be done for them by my Father who is in heaven. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>For where two or three are
gathered together in my name, there I am in their midst.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>Then Peter came and
said to him, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I
forgive him? Until seven times?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>Jesus said to him,
I don&rsquo;t tell you until seven times, but, until
seventy times seven. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>Therefore the Kingdom of Heaven
is like a certain king, who wanted to reconcile accounts with his
servants. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-24 verse newline" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>When he had
begun to reconcile, one was brought to him who owed him ten
thousand talents. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>But because he couldn&rsquo;t pay,
his lord commanded him to be sold, with his wife, his children, and all
that he had, and payment to be made. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>The servant therefore fell down
and kneeled before him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will
repay you all! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>The
lord of that servant, being moved with compassion, released him, and
forgave him the debt.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>But that servant went out,
and found one of his fellow servants, who owed him one
hundred denarii, and he grabbed him, and took him by the throat,
saying, Pay me what you owe!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>So his fellow servant fell
down at his feet and begged him, saying, Have patience with me, and I
will repay you! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>He
would not, but went and cast him into prison, until he should pay back
that which was due. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>So
when his fellow servants saw what was done, they were exceedingly sorry,
and came and told to their lord all that was done. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-32 verse newline" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>Then his lord called him in, and
said to him, You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt, because
you begged me. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>Shouldn&rsquo;t you also have had
mercy on your fellow servant, even as I had mercy on you? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-34 verse newline" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>His lord was angry, and
delivered him to the tormentors, until he should pay all that was due to
him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-35 verse" verse="35">&#xF646;&#xF648;</SPAN>So my heavenly
Father will also do to you, if you don&rsquo;t each forgive your brother from
your hearts for his misdeeds.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF6DC;&#xF641;</SPAN>It happened when Jesus
had finished these words, he departed from Galilee, and came into the
borders of Judea beyond the Jordan. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-2 verse newline" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>Great multitudes followed him,
and he healed them there. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-3 verse newline" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>Pharisees came to him, testing
him, and saying, Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any
reason?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>He answered, Haven&rsquo;t you read that he who made them from the beginning
made them male and female, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>and said, For this cause a man
shall leave his father and mother, and shall join to his wife, and the two
shall become one flesh? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>So that they are no more two, but
one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, don&rsquo;t let man tear
apart.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>They asked him, Why
then did Moses command us to give her a bill of divorce, and divorce
her?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>He said to them, Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, allowed you to
divorce your wives, but from the beginning it has not been so. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>I tell you that whoever divorces
his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits
adultery, and he who marries her when she is divorced commits
adultery.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>His disciples said to
him, If this is the case of the man with his wife, it is not expedient
to marry.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>But he said to them,
Not all men can receive this saying, but those to whom
it is given. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>For there
are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother&rsquo;s womb, and there
are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who made
themselves eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven&rsquo;s sake. He who is able to
receive it, let him receive it.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>Then little children
were brought to him, that he should lay his hands on them and pray, and
the disciples rebuked them. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>But Jesus said, Allow the little children, and don&rsquo;t forbid them to come to
me, for the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to ones like these.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>He laid his hands on
them, and departed from there.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>Behold, one came to
him and said, Good teacher, what good thing shall I do, that I may have
eternal life?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>He said to him, Why do you call me good? No one is good
but one, that is, God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the
commandments.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>He said to him,
Which ones?
<p>Jesus said, You shall not murder. You shall
not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not offer
false testimony. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Honor your father and
mother. And, You shall love your neighbor as
yourself.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>The young man said to
him, All these things I have observed from my youth. What do I still
lack?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>Jesus said to him,
If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have, and
give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven, and come, follow
me. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>But when
the young man heard the saying, he went away sad, for he was one who had
great possessions. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>Jesus
said to his disciples, Most certainly I say to you, a
rich man will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven with difficulty. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>Again I tell you, it is easier
for a camel to go through a needle&rsquo;s eye, than for a rich man to enter
into the Kingdom of God.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>When the disciples
heard it, they were exceedingly astonished, saying, Who then can be
saved?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>Looking at them,
Jesus said, With men this is impossible, but with God
all things are possible.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Then Peter answered,
Behold, we have left everything, and followed you. What then will we
have?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Jesus said to them,
Most certainly I tell you that you who have followed
me, in the regeneration when the Son of Man will sit on the throne of his
glory, you also will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of
Israel. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Everyone who has
left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or

<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF63A;&#xF639;</SPAN>For
the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who was the master of a household, who
went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>When he had agreed with the
laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his
vineyard. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>He went out
about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in
the marketplace. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>To them
he said, You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will
give you. So they went their way. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did likewise. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>About the eleventh
hour he went out, and found others standing idle. He said to them,
Why do you stand here all day idle?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>They said to him, Because
no one has hired us.
<p>He said to them, You also go into the
vineyard, and you will receive whatever is right. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>When evening had come, the lord
of the vineyard said to his manager, Call the laborers and pay them
their wages, beginning from the last to the first.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>When those who were hired at
about the eleventh hour came, they each received a denarius. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>When the first came, they
supposed that they would receive more, and they likewise each received a
denarius. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>When they
received it, they murmured against the master of the household, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>saying, These last have spent
one hour, and you have made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of
the day and the scorching heat!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>But he answered one of them,
Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Didn&rsquo;t you agree with me for a
denarius? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>Take that
which is yours, and go your way. It is my desire to give to this last just
as much as to you. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>Isn&rsquo;t it lawful for me to do

<SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>So the last will be

they were indignant, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>and
said to him, Do you hear what these are saying?
<p>Jesus said to them, Yes. Did you never read, Out

praise?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>He left them, and

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>Jesus answered them,
Most certainly I tell you, if you have faith, and

even if you told this mountain, Be taken up and cast into the sea,
it would be done. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>All

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>When he had come into
the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as

Who gave you this authority?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>Jesus answered them,
I also will ask you one question, which if you tell me,

it from? From heaven or from men?

he will ask us, Why then did you not believe him? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>But if we say, From men,
we fear the multitude, for all hold John as a prophet. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-27 verse newline" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>They answered Jesus, and said,
We don&rsquo;t know.
<p>He also said to them, Neither will I tell you by
what authority I do these things. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>But what do you think? A man had
two sons, and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work today in my
vineyard. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-29 verse newline" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>He
answered, I will not, but afterward he changed his mind, and went.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>He came to the second,
and said the same thing. He answered, I go, sir, but he didn&rsquo;t go.

<p>They said to him, The first.
<p>Jesus said to them, Most certainly I tell you that
the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering into the Kingdom of
God before you. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>For John
came to you in the way of righteousness, and you didn&rsquo;t believe him, but
the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. When you saw it, you

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>Hear another parable. There
was a man who was a master of a household, who planted a vineyard, set a
hedge about it, dug a winepress in it, built a tower, leased it out to
farmers, and went into another country. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-34 verse" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>When the season for the fruit
drew near, he sent his servants to the farmers, to receive his fruit.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-35 verse" verse="35">&#xF646;&#xF648;</SPAN>The farmers took his
servants, beat one, killed another, and stoned another. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-36 verse" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>Again, he sent other servants
more than the first: and they treated them the same way. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-37 verse" verse="37">&#xF646;&#xF64A;</SPAN>But afterward he sent to them
his son, saying, They will respect my son. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-38 verse" verse="38">&#xF646;&#xF64B;</SPAN>But the farmers, when they saw
the son, said among themselves, This is the heir. Come, let&rsquo;s kill
him, and seize his inheritance. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-39 verse" verse="39">&#xF646;&#xF64C;</SPAN>So they took him, and threw him
out of the vineyard, and killed him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-40 verse" verse="40">&#xF647;&#xF643;</SPAN>When therefore the lord of the
vineyard comes, what will he do to those farmers?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-41 verse" verse="41">&#xF647;&#xF644;</SPAN>They told him, He
will miserably destroy those miserable men, and will lease out the

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-42 verse" verse="42">&#xF647;&#xF645;</SPAN>Jesus said to them,
Did you never read in the Scriptures,

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-45 verse" verse="45">&#xF647;&#xF648;</SPAN>When the chief

about them. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-46 verse" verse="46">&#xF647;&#xF649;</SPAN>When they
sought to seize him, they feared the multitudes, because they considered
him to be a prophet.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF63A;&#xF63A;</SPAN>Jesus answered and
spoke again in parables to them, saying, The Kingdom of
Heaven is like a certain king, who made a marriage feast for his son,
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>and sent out his servants
to call those who were invited to the marriage feast, but they would not
come. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>Again he sent out
other servants, saying, Tell those who are invited, Behold, I have
prepared my dinner. My cattle and my fatlings are killed, and all things
are ready. Come to the marriage feast! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>But they made light of it, and
went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his merchandise, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>and the rest grabbed his
servants, and treated them shamefully, and killed them. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>When the king heard that, he was
angry, and sent his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned their
city.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>Then he said to his servants,
The wedding is ready, but those who were invited weren&rsquo;t worthy.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>Go therefore to the
intersections of the highways, and as many as you may find, invite to the
marriage feast. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-10 verse newline" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>Those
servants went out into the highways, and gathered together as many as they
found, both bad and good. The wedding was filled with guests. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>But when the king came in to see
the guests, he saw there a man who didn&rsquo;t have on wedding clothing,
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>and he said to him,
Friend, how did you come in here not wearing wedding clothing? He
was speechless. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>Then the
king said to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, take him away, and
throw him into the outer darkness, there is where the weeping and grinding
of teeth will be. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>For
many are called, but few chosen.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>Then the Pharisees
went and took counsel how they might entrap him in his talk. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>They sent their disciples to
him, along with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that you are
honest, and teach the way of God in truth, no matter whom you teach, for
you aren&rsquo;t partial to anyone. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Tell us therefore, what do you
think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>But Jesus perceived
their wickedness, and said, Why do you test me, you
hypocrites? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Show me the
tax money.
<p>They brought to him a denarius.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>He asked them, Whose is this image and inscription?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>They said to him,
Caesar&rsquo;s.
<p>Then he said to them, Give therefore to Caesar the
things that are Caesar&rsquo;s, and to God the things that are
God&rsquo;s.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>When they heard it,
they marveled, and left him, and went away.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>On that day Sadducees
(those who say that there is no resurrection) came to him. They asked him,
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>saying, Teacher,
Moses said, If a man dies, having no children, his brother shall marry
his wife, and raise up seed for his brother. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>Now there were with us seven
brothers. The first married and died, and having no seed left his wife to
his brother. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>In the same
way, the second also, and the third, to the seventh. After them all, the woman died.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-28 verse range" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64A;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>In the resurrection
therefore, whose wife will she be of the seven? For they all had her.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>But Jesus answered
them, You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures, nor
the power of God. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>For in
the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are
like God&rsquo;s angels in heaven. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>But concerning the resurrection
of the dead, haven&rsquo;t you read that which was spoken to you by God,
saying, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>I am the God
of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not
the God of the dead, but of the living.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>When the multitudes
heard it, they were astonished at his teaching. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-34 verse" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>But the Pharisees, when they
heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, gathered themselves together.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-35 verse" verse="35">&#xF646;&#xF648;</SPAN>One of them, a lawyer,
asked him a question, testing him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-36 verse" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>Teacher, which is the
greatest commandment in the law?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-37 verse" verse="37">&#xF646;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Jesus said to him,
You shall love the Lord your God with all your

commandment. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-39 verse" verse="39">&#xF646;&#xF64C;</SPAN>A second
likewise is this, You shall love your neighbor as yourself. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-40 verse" verse="40">&#xF647;&#xF643;</SPAN>The whole law and the prophets
depend on these two commandments.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-41 verse" verse="41">&#xF647;&#xF644;</SPAN>Now while the

do you think of the Christ? Whose son is he?

Be careful that no one leads you astray. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-5 verse range" verse="5">&#xF647;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF648;</SPAN>For many will come in my name,

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>When, therefore, you see the
abomination of desolation, which was spoken of through Daniel the
prophet, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand), <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>then let those who are in Judea
flee to the mountains. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Let him who is on the housetop

be in the winter, nor on a Sabbath, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>for then there will be great

<SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>For there will arise
false christs, and false prophets, and they will show great signs and

<p>Behold, I have told you
beforehand. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-26 verse range" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF648;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>If therefore
they tell you, Behold, he is in the wilderness, don&rsquo;t go out,
Behold, he is in the inner rooms, don&rsquo;t believe it. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>For as the lightning flashes

the carcass is, there is where the vultures gather

immediately after the oppression of those days, the sun will be darkened,
the moon will not give its light, the stars will fall from the sky, and
the powers of the heavens will be shaken, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>and then the sign of the Son of
Man will appear in the sky. Then all the tribes of the earth will mourn,

power and great glory. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>He will send out his angels with

will be the coming of the Son of Man. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-38 verse" verse="38">&#xF646;&#xF64B;</SPAN>For as in those days which were

marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ship, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-39 verse" verse="39">&#xF646;&#xF64C;</SPAN>and they didn&rsquo;t know until the
flood came, and took them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of
Man. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-40 verse" verse="40">&#xF647;&#xF643;</SPAN>Then two men will
be in the field: one will be taken and one will be left, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-41 verse" verse="41">&#xF647;&#xF644;</SPAN>two women grinding at the mill,
one will be taken and one will be left. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-42 verse" verse="42">&#xF647;&#xF645;</SPAN>Watch therefore, for you don&rsquo;t
know in what hour your Lord comes. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-43 verse" verse="43">&#xF647;&#xF646;</SPAN>But know this, that if the
master of the house had known in what watch of the night the thief was

broken into. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-44 verse" verse="44">&#xF647;&#xF647;</SPAN>Therefore
also be ready, for in an hour that you don&rsquo;t expect, the Son of Man will

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-45 verse" verse="45">&#xF647;&#xF648;</SPAN>Who then is the faithful and

he will set him over all that he has. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-48 verse" verse="48">&#xF647;&#xF64B;</SPAN>But if that evil servant should
say in his heart, My lord is delaying his coming, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-49 verse" verse="49">&#xF647;&#xF64C;</SPAN>and begins to beat his fellow
servants, and eat and drink with the drunkards, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-50 verse" verse="50">&#xF648;&#xF643;</SPAN>the lord of that servant will

will cut him in pieces, and appoint his portion with the hypocrites. There
is where the weeping and grinding of teeth will be.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF63A;&#xF63D;</SPAN>Then the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten virgins, who took

vessels with their lamps. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c25">25</SPAN><SPAN class="v25-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>Now while the bridegroom delayed,
they all slumbered and slept. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c25">25</SPAN><SPAN class="v25-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>But at midnight there was a cry,
Behold! The bridegroom is coming! Come out to meet him! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c25">25</SPAN><SPAN class="v25-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>Then all those virgins arose, and
trimmed their lamps. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c25">25</SPAN><SPAN class="v25-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>The foolish said to the wise,
Give us  some of your oil, for our lamps are going out. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c25">25</SPAN><SPAN class="v25-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>But the wise answered, saying,
What if there isn&rsquo;t enough for us and you? You go rather to those who

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c25">25</SPAN><SPAN class="v25-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>For it is like a man, going

to them. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c25">25</SPAN><SPAN class="v25-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>To one he gave
five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his own

five talents went and traded with them, and made another five talents.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c25">25</SPAN><SPAN class="v25-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>In the same way, he also
who got the two gained another two. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c25">25</SPAN><SPAN class="v25-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>But he who received the one went

<SPAN class="tab-chapter c25">25</SPAN><SPAN class="v25-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>I was afraid, and went
away and hid your talent in the earth. Behold, you have what is yours.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c25">25</SPAN><SPAN class="v25-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>But his lord answered him,
You wicked and slothful servant. You knew that I reap where I didn&rsquo;t
sow, and gather where I didn&rsquo;t scatter. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c25">25</SPAN><SPAN class="v25-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>You ought therefore to have
deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have
received back my own with interest. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c25">25</SPAN><SPAN class="v25-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Take away therefore the talent
from him, and give it to him who has the ten talents. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c25">25</SPAN><SPAN class="v25-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>For to everyone who has will be
given, and he will have abundance, but from him who doesn&rsquo;t have, even
that which he has will be taken away. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c25">25</SPAN><SPAN class="v25-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>Throw out the unprofitable

separates the sheep from the goats. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c25">25</SPAN><SPAN class="v25-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>He will set the sheep on his
right hand, but the goats on the left. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c25">25</SPAN><SPAN class="v25-34 verse" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>Then the King will tell those on
his right hand, Come, blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom
prepared for you from the foundation of the world, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c25">25</SPAN><SPAN class="v25-35 verse" verse="35">&#xF646;&#xF648;</SPAN>for I was hungry, and you gave
me food to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave me drink. I was a stranger,
and you took me in. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c25">25</SPAN><SPAN class="v25-36 verse newline" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>I
was naked, and you clothed me. I was sick, and you visited me. I was in
prison, and you came to me.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c25">25</SPAN><SPAN class="v25-37 verse" verse="37">&#xF646;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Then the righteous will
answer him, saying, Lord, when did we see you hungry, and feed you, or
thirsty, and give you a drink? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c25">25</SPAN><SPAN class="v25-38 verse" verse="38">&#xF646;&#xF64B;</SPAN>When did we see you as a
stranger, and take you in, or naked, and clothe you? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c25">25</SPAN><SPAN class="v25-39 verse" verse="39">&#xF646;&#xF64C;</SPAN>When did we see you sick, or in
prison, and come to you?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c25">25</SPAN><SPAN class="v25-40 verse" verse="40">&#xF647;&#xF643;</SPAN>The King will answer them,
Most certainly I tell you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least
of these my brothers, you did it to me. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c25">25</SPAN><SPAN class="v25-41 verse newline" verse="41">&#xF647;&#xF644;</SPAN>Then he will say also to those
on the left hand, Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire
which is prepared for the devil and his angels, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c25">25</SPAN><SPAN class="v25-42 verse" verse="42">&#xF647;&#xF645;</SPAN>for I was hungry, and you
didn&rsquo;t give me food to eat, I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink,
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c25">25</SPAN><SPAN class="v25-43 verse" verse="43">&#xF647;&#xF646;</SPAN>I was a stranger, and
you didn&rsquo;t take me in, naked, and you didn&rsquo;t clothe me, sick, and in
prison, and you didn&rsquo;t visit me.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c25">25</SPAN><SPAN class="v25-44 verse" verse="44">&#xF647;&#xF647;</SPAN>Then they will also answer,
saying, Lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or
naked, or sick, or in prison, and didn&rsquo;t help you?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c25">25</SPAN><SPAN class="v25-45 verse" verse="45">&#xF647;&#xF648;</SPAN>Then he will answer them,
saying, Most certainly I tell you, inasmuch as you didn&rsquo;t do it to
one of the least of these, you didn&rsquo;t do it to me. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c25">25</SPAN><SPAN class="v25-46 verse" verse="46">&#xF647;&#xF649;</SPAN>These will go away into eternal
punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF63A;&#xF63E;</SPAN>It happened, when
Jesus had finished all these words, that he said to his disciples, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>You know that
after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be
delivered up to be crucified.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>Then the chief
priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people were gathered together
in the court of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>They took counsel together that
they might take Jesus by deceit, and kill him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>But they said, Not during the
feast, lest a riot occur among the people.</div><div class="section K"><h2>Section K</h2>
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>Now when Jesus was in
Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>a woman came to him having an
alabaster jar of very expensive ointment, and she poured it on his head as
he sat at the table. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>But
when his disciples saw this, they were indignant, saying, Why this
waste? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>For this ointment
might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>However, knowing
this, Jesus said to them, Why do you trouble the woman?
Because she has done a good work for me. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>For you always have the poor
with you, but you don&rsquo;t always have me. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>For in pouring this ointment on
my body, she did it to prepare me for burial. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>Most certainly I tell you,
wherever this Good News is preached in the whole world, what this woman
has done will also be spoken of as a memorial of her.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>Then one of the
twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>and said, What are you
willing to give me, that I should deliver him to you? They weighed out
for him thirty pieces of silver. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>From that time he sought
opportunity to betray him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Now on the first day
of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying to him, Where
do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>He said, Go into the city to a certain person, and tell him, The
Teacher says, My time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your
house with my disciples.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>The disciples did as
Jesus commanded them, and they prepared the Passover. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>Now when evening had come, he
was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>As they were eating, he said,
Most certainly I tell you that one of you will betray
me.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>They were exceedingly
sorrowful, and each began to ask him, It isn&rsquo;t me, is it, Lord?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>He answered, He who dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same will
betray me. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>The Son of
Man goes, even as it is written of him, but woe to that man through whom
the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not
been born.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>Judas, who betrayed
him, answered, It isn&rsquo;t me, is it, Rabbi?
<p>He said to him, You said it.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>As they were eating,
Jesus took bread, gave thanks for it, and broke it. He
gave to the disciples, and said, Take, eat, this is my
body. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>He took
the cup, gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, All of
you drink it, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>for this
is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the
remission of sins. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>But I
tell you that I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on,
until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father&rsquo;s
Kingdom. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>When
they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>Then Jesus said to
them, All of you will be made to stumble because of me
tonight, for it is written, I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep
of the flock will be scattered. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>But after I am raised up, I will
go before you into Galilee.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>But Peter answered
him, Even if all will be made to stumble because of you, I will never
be made to stumble.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-34 verse" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>Jesus said to him,
Most certainly I tell you that tonight, before the
rooster crows, you will deny me three times.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-35 verse" verse="35">&#xF646;&#xF648;</SPAN>Peter said to him,
Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you. All of the
disciples also said likewise.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-36 verse" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>Then Jesus came with
them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to his disciples, Sit here, while I go there and pray. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-37 verse" verse="37">&#xF646;&#xF64A;</SPAN>He took with him Peter and the
two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and severely troubled.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-38 verse" verse="38">&#xF646;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Then he said to them,
My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay
here, and watch with me.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-39 verse" verse="39">&#xF646;&#xF64C;</SPAN>He went forward a
little, fell on his face, and prayed, saying, My
Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me, nevertheless,
not what I desire, but what you desire.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-40 verse" verse="40">&#xF647;&#xF643;</SPAN>He came to the
disciples, and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, What, couldn&rsquo;t you watch with me for one hour? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-41 verse" verse="41">&#xF647;&#xF644;</SPAN>Watch and pray, that you don&rsquo;t
enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is
weak.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-42 verse" verse="42">&#xF647;&#xF645;</SPAN>Again, a second time
he went away, and prayed, saying, My Father, if this
cup can&rsquo;t pass away from me unless I drink it, your desire be
done. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-43 verse" verse="43">&#xF647;&#xF646;</SPAN>He came
again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-44 verse" verse="44">&#xF647;&#xF647;</SPAN>He left them again, went away,
and prayed a third time, saying the same words. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-45 verse" verse="45">&#xF647;&#xF648;</SPAN>Then he came to his disciples,
and said to them, Sleep on now, and take your rest.
Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands
of sinners. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-46 verse" verse="46">&#xF647;&#xF649;</SPAN>Arise,
let&rsquo;s be going. Behold, he who betrays me is at hand.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-47 verse" verse="47">&#xF647;&#xF64A;</SPAN>While he was still
speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great
multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priest and elders of the
people. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-48 verse" verse="48">&#xF647;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Now he who
betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whoever I kiss, he is the one.
Seize him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-49 verse newline" verse="49">&#xF647;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Immediately he came to Jesus,
and said, Hail, Rabbi! and kissed him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-50 verse" verse="50">&#xF648;&#xF643;</SPAN>Jesus said to him,
Friend, why are you here? Then they came and
laid hands on Jesus, and took him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-51 verse" verse="51">&#xF648;&#xF644;</SPAN>Behold, one of those who were
with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck the
servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-52 verse" verse="52">&#xF648;&#xF645;</SPAN>Then Jesus said to him, Put your sword back into its place, for all those who take
the sword will die by the sword. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-53 verse" verse="53">&#xF648;&#xF646;</SPAN>Or do you think that I
couldn&rsquo;t ask my Father, and he would even now send me more than twelve
legions of angels? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-54 verse" verse="54">&#xF648;&#xF647;</SPAN>How
then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that it must be so?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-55 verse" verse="55">&#xF648;&#xF648;</SPAN>In that hour Jesus
said to the multitudes, Have you come out as against a
robber with swords and clubs to seize me? I sat daily in the temple
teaching, and you didn&rsquo;t arrest me. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-56 verse" verse="56">&#xF648;&#xF649;</SPAN>But all this has happened, that
the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.
<p>Then all the disciples left him, and fled. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-57 verse" verse="57">&#xF648;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Those who had taken Jesus led
him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders
were gathered together. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-58 verse" verse="58">&#xF648;&#xF64B;</SPAN>But Peter followed him from a
distance, to the court of the high priest, and entered in and sat with the
officers, to see the end. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-59 verse" verse="59">&#xF648;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Now the chief priests, the
elders, and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus, that
they might put him to death, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-60 verse" verse="60">&#xF649;&#xF643;</SPAN>and they found none. Even though
many false witnesses came forward, they found none. But at last two false
witnesses came forward, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-61 verse" verse="61">&#xF649;&#xF644;</SPAN>and said, This man said, I
am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-62 verse" verse="62">&#xF649;&#xF645;</SPAN>The high priest stood
up, and said to him, Have you no answer? What is this that these
testify against you? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-63 verse" verse="63">&#xF649;&#xF646;</SPAN>But Jesus held his peace. The
high priest answered him, I adjure you by the living God, that you tell
us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-64 verse" verse="64">&#xF649;&#xF647;</SPAN>Jesus said to him,
You have said it. Nevertheless, I tell you, after this
you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming
on the clouds of the sky.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-65 verse" verse="65">&#xF649;&#xF648;</SPAN>Then the high priest
tore his clothing, saying, He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any
more witnesses? Behold, now you have heard his blasphemy. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-66 verse" verse="66">&#xF649;&#xF649;</SPAN>What do you think?
<p>They answered, He is worthy of death! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-67 verse" verse="67">&#xF649;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Then they spit in his face and
beat him with their fists, and some slapped him, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-68 verse" verse="68">&#xF649;&#xF64B;</SPAN>saying, Prophesy to us, you
Christ! Who hit you?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-69 verse" verse="69">&#xF649;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Now Peter was sitting
outside in the court, and a maid came to him, saying, You were also
with Jesus, the Galilean!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-70 verse" verse="70">&#xF64A;&#xF643;</SPAN>But he denied it
before them all, saying, I don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-71 verse" verse="71">&#xF64A;&#xF644;</SPAN>When he had gone out
onto the porch, someone else saw him, and said to those who were there,
This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-72 verse" verse="72">&#xF64A;&#xF645;</SPAN>Again he denied it
with an oath, I don&rsquo;t know the man.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-73 verse" verse="73">&#xF64A;&#xF646;</SPAN>After a little while
those who stood by came and said to Peter, Surely you are also one of
them, for your speech makes you known.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-74 verse" verse="74">&#xF64A;&#xF647;</SPAN>Then he began to
curse and to swear, I don&rsquo;t know the man!
<p>Immediately the rooster crowed. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c26">26</SPAN><SPAN class="v26-75 verse" verse="75">&#xF64A;&#xF648;</SPAN>Peter remembered the word which
Jesus had said to him, Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three
times. He went out and wept bitterly.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF63A;&#xF63F;</SPAN>Now when morning had
come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel
against Jesus to put him to death: <SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>and they bound him, and led him
away, and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate, the governor. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>Then Judas, who betrayed him,
when he saw that Jesus was condemned, felt remorse, and brought back the
thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>saying, I have sinned in that
I betrayed innocent blood.
<p>But they said, What is that to us? You see to it.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>He threw down the
pieces of silver in the sanctuary, and departed. He went away and hanged
himself. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>The chief
priests took the pieces of silver, and said, It&rsquo;s not lawful to put
them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>They took counsel, and bought the
potter&rsquo;s field with them, to bury strangers in. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>Therefore that field was called
The Field of Blood to this day. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>Then that which was spoken
through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying,
<dl>
<dt>They took the thirty pieces of silver,
<dd>the price of him upon whom a price had been set,
<dd>whom some of the children of Israel priced,
<dt><SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>and they gave them
for the potter&rsquo;s field,
<dd>as the Lord commanded me.
</dl>
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>Now Jesus stood
before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Are you the
King of the Jews?
<p>Jesus said to him, So you say.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>When he was accused
by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>Then Pilate said to him,
Don&rsquo;t you hear how many things they testify against you?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>He gave him no
answer, not even one word, so that the governor marveled greatly. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>Now at the feast the governor
was accustomed to release to the multitude one prisoner, whom they
desired. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>They had then a
notable prisoner, called Barabbas. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>When therefore they were
gathered together, Pilate said to them, Whom do you want me to release
to you? Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called Christ? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>For he knew that because of envy
they had delivered him up.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>While he was sitting
on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Have nothing to do
with that righteous man, for I have suffered many things this day in a
dream because of him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>Now the chief priests and the
elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>But the governor
answered them, Which of the two do you want me to release to you?
<p>They said, Barabbas!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>Pilate said to them,
What then shall I do to Jesus, who is called Christ?
<p>They all said to him, Let him be crucified!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>But the governor
said, Why? What evil has he done?
<p>But they cried out exceedingly, saying, Let him be crucified!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>So when Pilate saw
that nothing was being gained, but rather that a disturbance was starting,
he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am
innocent of the blood of this righteous person. You see to it.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>All the people
answered, May his blood be on us, and on our children!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>Then he released to
them Barabbas, but Jesus he flogged and delivered to be crucified. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Then the governor&rsquo;s soldiers
took Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered the whole garrison together
against him. They
stripped him, and put a scarlet robe on him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-29 verse range" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64B;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>They braided a crown of thorns
and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand, and they kneeled
down before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>They spat on him, and
took the reed and struck him on the head. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>When they had mocked him, they
took the robe off of him, and put his clothes on him, and led him away to
crucify him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>As they came out,
they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, and they compelled him to go
with them, that he might carry his cross. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>They came to a place called
Golgotha, that is to say, The place of a skull. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-34 verse" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>They gave him sour wine to drink
mixed with gall. When he had tasted it, he would not drink. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-35 verse" verse="35">&#xF646;&#xF648;</SPAN>When they had crucified him,
they divided his clothing among them, casting lots, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-36 verse" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>and they sat and watched him
there. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-37 verse" verse="37">&#xF646;&#xF64A;</SPAN>They set up over
his head the accusation against him written, THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF
THE JEWS.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-38 verse" verse="38">&#xF646;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Then there were two
robbers crucified with him, one on his right hand and one on the left.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-39 verse" verse="39">&#xF646;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Those who passed by
blasphemed him, wagging their heads, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-40 verse" verse="40">&#xF647;&#xF643;</SPAN>and saying, You who destroy
the temple, and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son
of God, come down from the cross!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-41 verse" verse="41">&#xF647;&#xF644;</SPAN>Likewise the chief
priests also mocking, with the scribes, the Pharisees,
and the elders, said, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-42 verse" verse="42">&#xF647;&#xF645;</SPAN>He saved others, but he
can&rsquo;t save himself. If he is the King of Israel, let him come down from
the cross now, and we will believe in him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-43 verse" verse="43">&#xF647;&#xF646;</SPAN>He trusts in God. Let God
deliver him now, if he wants him, for he said, I am the Son of
God. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-44 verse newline" verse="44">&#xF647;&#xF647;</SPAN>The robbers
also who were crucified with him cast on him the same reproach.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-45 verse" verse="45">&#xF647;&#xF648;</SPAN>Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the
ninth hour. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-46 verse" verse="46">&#xF647;&#xF649;</SPAN>About the ninth hour Jesus cried
with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lima sabachthani? That is, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-47 verse" verse="47">&#xF647;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Some of them who
stood there, when they heard it, said, This man is calling Elijah.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-48 verse" verse="48">&#xF647;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Immediately one of
them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a
reed, and gave him a drink. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-49 verse" verse="49">&#xF647;&#xF64C;</SPAN>The rest said, Let him be.
Let&rsquo;s see whether Elijah comes to save him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-50 verse" verse="50">&#xF648;&#xF643;</SPAN>Jesus cried again
with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-51 verse newline" verse="51">&#xF648;&#xF644;</SPAN>Behold, the veil of the temple
was torn in two from the top to the bottom. The earth quaked and the rocks
were split. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-52 verse" verse="52">&#xF648;&#xF645;</SPAN>The tombs
were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were
raised, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-53 verse" verse="53">&#xF648;&#xF646;</SPAN>and coming out
of the tombs after his resurrection, they entered into the holy city and
appeared to many. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-54 verse" verse="54">&#xF648;&#xF647;</SPAN>Now
the centurion, and those who were with him watching Jesus, when they saw
the earthquake, and the things that were done, feared exceedingly, saying,
Truly this was the Son of God.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-55 verse" verse="55">&#xF648;&#xF648;</SPAN>Many women were there
watching from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-56 verse" verse="56">&#xF648;&#xF649;</SPAN>Among them were Mary
Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons
of Zebedee. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-57 verse" verse="57">&#xF648;&#xF64A;</SPAN>When evening
had come, a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who himself was also
Jesus disciple came. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-58 verse" verse="58">&#xF648;&#xF64B;</SPAN>This man went to Pilate, and
asked for Jesus body. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given up.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-59 verse" verse="59">&#xF648;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Joseph took the body,
and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-60 verse" verse="60">&#xF649;&#xF643;</SPAN>and laid it in his own new tomb,
which he had cut out in the rock, and he rolled a great stone to the door
of the tomb, and departed. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-61 verse" verse="61">&#xF649;&#xF644;</SPAN>Mary Magdalene was there, and
the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-62 verse" verse="62">&#xF649;&#xF645;</SPAN>Now on the next day, which was
the day after the Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees
were gathered together to Pilate, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-63 verse" verse="63">&#xF649;&#xF646;</SPAN>saying, Sir, we remember what
that deceiver said while he was still alive: After three days I will
rise again. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-64 verse" verse="64">&#xF649;&#xF647;</SPAN>Command
therefore that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest perhaps
his disciples come at night and steal him away, and tell the people, He
is risen from the dead, and the last deception will be worse than the
first.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-65 verse" verse="65">&#xF649;&#xF648;</SPAN>Pilate said to them,
You have a guard. Go, make it as secure as you can. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c27">27</SPAN><SPAN class="v27-66 verse" verse="66">&#xF649;&#xF649;</SPAN>So they went with the guard and
made the tomb secure, sealing the stone.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF63A;&#xF640;</SPAN>Now after the Sabbath,
as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the
other Mary came to see the tomb. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c28">28</SPAN><SPAN class="v28-2 verse newline" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>Behold, there was a great
earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky, and came and
rolled away the stone from the door, and sat on it. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c28">28</SPAN><SPAN class="v28-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>His appearance was like
lightning, and his clothing white as snow. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c28">28</SPAN><SPAN class="v28-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>For fear of him, the guards
shook, and became like dead men. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c28">28</SPAN><SPAN class="v28-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>The angel answered the women,
Don&rsquo;t be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus, who has been
crucified. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c28">28</SPAN><SPAN class="v28-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>He is not
here, for he has risen, just like he said. Come, see the place where the
Lord was lying. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c28">28</SPAN><SPAN class="v28-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>Go
quickly and tell his disciples, He has risen from the dead, and behold,
he goes before you into Galilee, there you will see him. Behold, I have
told you.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c28">28</SPAN><SPAN class="v28-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>They departed quickly
from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples
word. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c28">28</SPAN><SPAN class="v28-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>As they went to
tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, Rejoice!
<p>They came and took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c28">28</SPAN><SPAN class="v28-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>Then Jesus said to
them, Don&rsquo;t be afraid. Go tell my brothers that they should go into Galilee, and there they
will see me.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c28">28</SPAN><SPAN class="v28-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>Now while they were
going, behold, some of the guards came into the city, and told the chief
priests all the things that had happened. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c28">28</SPAN><SPAN class="v28-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>When they were assembled with
the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave a large amount of silver to
the soldiers, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c28">28</SPAN><SPAN class="v28-13 verse newline" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>saying,
Say that his disciples came by night, and stole him away while we
slept. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c28">28</SPAN><SPAN class="v28-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>If this comes to
the governor&rsquo;s ears, we will persuade him and make you free of worry.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c28">28</SPAN><SPAN class="v28-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>So they took the money
and did as they were told. This saying was spread abroad among the Jews,
and continues until this day.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c28">28</SPAN><SPAN class="v28-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>But the eleven
disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had sent them.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c28">28</SPAN><SPAN class="v28-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>When they saw him, they
bowed down to him, but some doubted. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c28">28</SPAN><SPAN class="v28-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Jesus came to them and spoke to
them, saying, All authority has been given to me in
heaven and on earth. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c28">28</SPAN><SPAN class="v28-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Go, and make disciples of all
nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of
the Holy Spirit, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c28">28</SPAN><SPAN class="v28-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>teaching them to observe all
things that I commanded you. Behold, I am with you always, even to the end
of the age. Amen.

<SPAN class="chapter">&#xF6DC;</SPAN>Since many have undertaken
to set in order a narrative concerning those matters which have been
fulfilled among us, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>even
as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word
delivered them to us, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>it
seemed good to me also, having traced the course of all things accurately
from the first, to write to you in order, most excellent Theophilus,
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>that you might know the
certainty concerning the things in which you were instructed.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>There was in the days
of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the
priestly division of Abijah. He had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and
her name was Elizabeth. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>They were both righteous before
God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and ordinances of the
Lord. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>But they had no
child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they both were well advanced in
years. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>Now it happened,
while he executed the priest&rsquo;s office before God in the order of his
division, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>according to the
custom of the priest&rsquo;s office, his lot was to enter into the temple of
the Lord and burn incense. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>The whole multitude of the people
were praying outside at the hour of incense.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>An angel of the Lord
appeared to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>Zacharias was troubled
when he saw him, and fear fell upon him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>But the angel said to him,
Don&rsquo;t be afraid, Zacharias, because your request has been heard, and
your wife, Elizabeth, will bear you a son, and you shall call his name
John. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>You will have joy
and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>For he will be great in the sight
of the Lord, and he will drink no wine nor strong drink. He will be filled
with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother&rsquo;s womb. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>He will turn many of the children
of Israel to the Lord, their God. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>He will go before him in the
spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the
children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to prepare a
people prepared for the Lord.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Zacharias said to the
angel, How can I be sure of this? For I am an old man, and my wife is
well advanced in years.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>The angel answered
him, I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God. I was sent to
speak to you, and to bring you this good news. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>Behold, you will be silent and
not able to speak, until the day that these things will happen, because
you didn&rsquo;t believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their proper
time.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>The people were
waiting for Zacharias, and they marveled that he delayed in the temple.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>When he came out, he
could not speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision in
the temple. He continued making signs to them, and remained mute. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>It happened, when the days of his
service were fulfilled, he departed to his house. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-24 verse newline" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>After these days Elizabeth, his
wife, conceived, and she hid herself five months, saying, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>Thus has the Lord done to me
in the days in which he looked at me, to take away my reproach among
men.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>Now in the sixth
month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee, named
Nazareth, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>to a virgin
pledged to be married to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of
David. The virgin&rsquo;s name was Mary. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Having come in, the angel said to
her, Rejoice, you highly favored one! The Lord is with you. Blessed are
you among women!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>But when she saw him,
she was greatly troubled at the saying, and considered what kind of
salutation this might be. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>The angel said to her, Don&rsquo;t
be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-31 verse newline" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>Behold, you will conceive in your
womb, and bring forth a son, and will call his name Jesus. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>He will be great, and will be
called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of
his father, David, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>and he
will reign over the house of Jacob forever. There will be no end to his
Kingdom.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-34 verse" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>Mary said to the
angel, How can this be, seeing I am a virgin?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-35 verse" verse="35">&#xF646;&#xF648;</SPAN>The angel answered
her, The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High
will overshadow you. Therefore also the holy one who is born from you will
be called the Son of God. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-36 verse newline" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>Behold, Elizabeth, your relative,
also has conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month with
her who was called barren. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-37 verse" verse="37">&#xF646;&#xF64A;</SPAN>For everything spoken by God is
possible.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-38 verse" verse="38">&#xF646;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Mary said, Behold,
the handmaid of the Lord, be it to me according to your word.
<p>The angel departed from her. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-39 verse" verse="39">&#xF646;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Mary arose in those days and went
into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-40 verse" verse="40">&#xF647;&#xF643;</SPAN>and entered into the house of
Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-41 verse" verse="41">&#xF647;&#xF644;</SPAN>It happened, when Elizabeth heard
Mary&rsquo;s greeting, that the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was
filled with the Holy Spirit. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-42 verse" verse="42">&#xF647;&#xF645;</SPAN>She called out with a loud voice,
and said, Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your
womb! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-43 verse" verse="43">&#xF647;&#xF646;</SPAN>Why am I so
favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-44 verse" verse="44">&#xF647;&#xF647;</SPAN>For behold, when the voice of
your greeting came into my ears, the baby leaped in my womb for joy!
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-45 verse" verse="45">&#xF647;&#xF648;</SPAN>Blessed is she who

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>All testified about

many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut up
three years and six months, when a great famine came over all the land.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>Elijah was sent to none
of them, except to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a

lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them
was cleansed, except Naaman, the Syrian.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>They were all filled
with wrath in the synagogue, as they heard these things. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>They rose up, threw him out of
the city, and led him to the brow of the hill that their city was built
on, that they might throw him off the cliff. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>But he, passing through their

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>He came down to
Capernaum, a city of Galilee. He was teaching them on the Sabbath day,
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>and they were astonished
at his teaching, for his word was with authority. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>In the synagogue there was a man
who had a spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice,
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-34 verse" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>saying, Ah! what have
we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know
you who you are: the Holy One of God!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-35 verse" verse="35">&#xF646;&#xF648;</SPAN>Jesus rebuked him,
saying, Be silent, and come out of him! When
the demon had thrown him down in their midst, he came out of him, having
done him no harm.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-36 verse" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>Amazement came on all,
and they spoke together, one with another, saying, What is this word?
For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they
come out! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-37 verse" verse="37">&#xF646;&#xF64A;</SPAN>News about
him went out into every place of the surrounding region.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-38 verse" verse="38">&#xF646;&#xF64B;</SPAN>He rose up from the
synagogue, and entered into Simon&rsquo;s house. Simon&rsquo;s mother-in-law was
afflicted with a great fever, and they begged him for her. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-39 verse" verse="39">&#xF646;&#xF64C;</SPAN>He stood over her, and rebuked
the fever, and it left her. Immediately she rose up and served them.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-40 verse" verse="40">&#xF647;&#xF643;</SPAN>When the sun was setting,
all those who had any sick with various diseases brought them to him, and
he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-41 verse" verse="41">&#xF647;&#xF644;</SPAN>Demons also came out from many,
crying out, and saying, You are the Christ, the Son of God! Rebuking
them, he didn&rsquo;t allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the
Christ.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-42 verse" verse="42">&#xF647;&#xF645;</SPAN>When it was day, he
departed and went into an uninhabited place, and the multitudes looked for
him, and came to him, and held on to him, so that he wouldn&rsquo;t go away
from them. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-43 verse" verse="43">&#xF647;&#xF646;</SPAN>But he said to
them, I must preach the good news of the Kingdom of God
to the other cities also. For this reason I have been sent.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-44 verse" verse="44">&#xF647;&#xF647;</SPAN>He was preaching in the
synagogues of Galilee.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF63D;</SPAN>Now it happened, while
the multitude pressed on him and heard the word of God, that he was
standing by the lake of Gennesaret. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-2 verse newline" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>He saw two boats standing by the
lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them, and were washing their nets.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>He entered into one of the
boats, which was Simon&rsquo;s, and asked him to put out a little from the
land. He sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-4 verse newline" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>When he had finished speaking, he
said to Simon, Put out into the deep, and let down your
nets for a catch.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>Simon answered him,
Master, we worked all night, and took nothing, but at your word I will
let down the net. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>When
they had done this, they caught a great multitude of fish, and their net
was breaking. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>They
beckoned to their partners in the other boat, that they should come and
help them. They came, and filled both boats, so that they began to sink.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>But Simon Peter, when he
saw it, fell down at Jesus knees, saying, Depart from me, for I am a
sinful man, Lord. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>For
he was amazed, and all who were with him, at the catch of fish which they
had caught, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>and so also
were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon.
<p>Jesus said to Simon, Don&rsquo;t be afraid. From now on
you will be catching people alive.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>When they had brought
their boats to land, they left everything, and followed him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>It happened, while he was in one
of the cities, behold, there was a man full of leprosy. When he saw Jesus,
he fell on his face, and begged him, saying, Lord, if you want to, you
can make me clean.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>He stretched out his
hand, and touched him, saying, I want to. Be made
clean.
<p>Immediately the leprosy left him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>He commanded him to tell no one,
But go your way, and show yourself to the priest, and
offer for your cleansing according to what Moses commanded, for a
testimony to them. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>But the report concerning him
spread much more, and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be
healed by him of their infirmities. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>But he withdrew himself into the
desert, and prayed.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>It happened on one of
those days, that he was teaching, and there were Pharisees and teachers of
the law sitting by, who had come out of every village of Galilee, Judea,
and Jerusalem. The power of the Lord was with him to heal them. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Behold, men brought a paralyzed
man on a cot, and they sought to bring him in to lay before Jesus. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Not finding a way to bring him in
because of the multitude, they went up to the housetop, and let him down
through the tiles with his cot into the midst before Jesus. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>Seeing their faith, he said to
him, Man, your sins are forgiven you.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>The scribes and the
Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this that speaks blasphemies?
Who can forgive sins, but God alone?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>But Jesus, perceiving
their thoughts, answered them, Why are you reasoning so
in your hearts? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>Which is
easier to say, Your sins are forgiven you, or to say, Arise and
walk? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>But that you may
know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins
(he said to the paralyzed man), I tell you, arise, and
take up your cot, and go to your house.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>Immediately he rose up
before them, and took up that which he was laying on, and departed to his
house, glorifying God. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-26 verse newline" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>Amazement took hold on all, and
they glorified God. They were filled with fear, saying, We have seen
strange things today.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>After these things he
went out, and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax office,
and said to him, Follow me!
<p>He left everything,
and rose up and followed him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-29 verse range" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64B;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Levi made a great feast for him

were reclining with them. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>Their scribes and the Pharisees
murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do you eat and drink with
the tax collectors and sinners? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>Jesus answered them, Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those
who are sick do. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>I have
not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>They said to him,
Why do John&rsquo;s disciples often fast and pray, likewise also the
disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-34 verse" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>He said to them, Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast, while the
bridegroom is with them? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-35 verse" verse="35">&#xF646;&#xF648;</SPAN>But the days will come when the
bridegroom will be taken away from them. Then they will fast in those
days. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-36 verse" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>He also
told a parable to them. No one puts a piece from a new
garment on an old garment, or else he will tear the new, and also the
piece from the new will not match the old. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-37 verse" verse="37">&#xF646;&#xF64A;</SPAN>No one puts new wine into old
wineskins, or else the new wine will burst the skins, and it will be
spilled, and the skins will be destroyed. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-38 verse" verse="38">&#xF646;&#xF64B;</SPAN>But new wine must be put into
fresh wineskins, and both are preserved. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-39 verse newline" verse="39">&#xF646;&#xF64C;</SPAN>No man having drunk old wine
immediately desires new, for he says, The old is better.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF63E;</SPAN>Now it happened on the
second Sabbath after the first, that he was going through the grain
fields. His disciples plucked the heads of grain, and ate, rubbing them in
their hands. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>But some of
the Pharisees said to them, Why do you do that which is not lawful to
do on the Sabbath day?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>Jesus, answering them,
said, Haven&rsquo;t you read what David did when he was
hungry, he, and those who were with him, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>how he entered into God&rsquo;s house,

which is not lawful to eat except for the priests alone? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>He said to them, The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.

watched him, to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath, that they might

said to the man who had the withered hand, Rise up, and
stand in the middle. He arose and stood. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>Then Jesus said to them, I will ask you something: Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do

Andrew, his brother, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>Matthew, Thomas, James, the son
of Alphaeus, Simon, who was called the Zealot, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-16 verse newline" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>Judas the son of James, and Judas
Iscariot, who also became a traitor. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>He came down with them, and stood
on a level place, with a crowd of his disciples, and a great number of the
people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon,
who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>as well as those who were
troubled by unclean spirits, and they were being healed. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>All the multitude sought to touch
him, for power came out from him and healed them all.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>He lifted up his eyes

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-39 verse" verse="39">&#xF646;&#xF64C;</SPAN>He spoke a parable to

you tell your brother, Brother, let me remove the speck of chaff that
is in your eye, when you yourself don&rsquo;t see the beam that is in your

you can see clearly to remove the speck of chaff that is in your
brother&rsquo;s eye. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-43 verse" verse="43">&#xF647;&#xF646;</SPAN>For
there is no good tree that brings forth rotten fruit, nor again a rotten
tree that brings forth good fruit. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-44 verse" verse="44">&#xF647;&#xF647;</SPAN>For each tree is known by its own

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-46 verse" verse="46">&#xF647;&#xF649;</SPAN>Why do you call me, Lord,
Lord, and don&rsquo;t do the things which I say? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-47 verse" verse="47">&#xF647;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Everyone who comes to me, and
hears my words, and does them, I will show you who he is like. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-48 verse" verse="48">&#xF647;&#xF64B;</SPAN>He is like a man building a
house, who dug and went deep, and laid a foundation on the rock. When a
flood arose, the stream broke against that house, and could not shake it,
because it was founded on the rock. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-49 verse" verse="49">&#xF647;&#xF64C;</SPAN>But he who hears, and doesn&rsquo;t
do, is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation,
against which the stream broke, and immediately it fell, and the ruin of
that house was great.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF63F;</SPAN>After he had finished
speaking in the hearing of the people, he entered into Capernaum. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>A certain centurion&rsquo;s servant,
who was dear to him, was sick and at the point of death. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>When he heard about Jesus, he sent
to him elders of the Jews, asking him to come and save his servant.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>When they came to Jesus,
they begged him earnestly, saying, He is worthy for you to do this for
him, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>for he loves our
nation, and he built our synagogue for us. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>Jesus went with them. When he was
now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to
him, Lord, don&rsquo;t trouble yourself, for I am not worthy for you to
come under my roof. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>Therefore I didn&rsquo;t even think
myself worthy to come to you, but say the word, and my servant will be
healed. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>For I also am a
man placed under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one,
Go! and he goes, and to another, Come! and he comes, and to my
servant, Do this, and he does it.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>When Jesus heard these
things, he marveled at him, and turned and said to the multitude who
followed him, I tell you, I have not found such great
faith, no, not in Israel. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>Those who were sent, returning to
the house, found that the servant who had been sick was well.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>It happened soon
afterwards, that he went to a city called Nain. Many of his disciples,
along with a great multitude, went with him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-12 verse newline" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>Now when he drew near to the gate
of the city, behold, one who was dead was carried out, the only son of his
mother, and she was a widow. Many people of the city were with her.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>When the Lord saw her, he
had compassion on her, and said to her, Don&rsquo;t
cry. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>He came
near and touched the coffin, and the bearers stood still. He said, Young man, I tell you, arise! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>He who was dead sat up, and began
to speak. And he gave him to his mother.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>Fear took hold of all,
and they glorified God, saying, A great prophet has arisen among us!
and, God has visited his people! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>This report went out concerning
him in the whole of Judea, and in all the surrounding region.
<p>The disciples of John
told him about all these things. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-19 verse range" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64B;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>John, calling to himself two of
his disciples, sent them to Jesus, saying, Are you the one who is
coming, or should we look for another? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>When the men had come to him,
they said, John the Baptist has sent us to you, saying, Are you he
who comes, or should we look for another?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>In that hour he cured
many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits, and to many who were blind
he gave sight. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>Jesus
answered them, Go and tell John the things which you
have seen and heard: that the blind receive their sight, the lame walk,
the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the
poor have good news preached to them. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>Blessed is he who finds no
occasion for stumbling in me.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>When John&rsquo;s
messengers had departed, he began to tell the multitudes about John, What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken
by the wind? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>But what did
you go out to see? A man clothed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are
gorgeously dressed, and live delicately, are in kings courts. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>But what did you go out to see? A
prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>This is he of whom it is written,
<dl>
<dt>Behold, I send my messenger before your face,
<dd>who will prepare your way before you.
</dl>
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>For I tell you, among those
who are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the
Baptist, yet he who is least in the Kingdom of God is greater than
he.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>When all the people
and the tax collectors heard this, they declared God to be just, having
been baptized with John&rsquo;s baptism. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-30 verse newline" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>But the Pharisees and the lawyers
rejected the counsel of God, not being baptized by him themselves.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>To what
then will I liken the people of this generation? What are they like?
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>They are like children
who sit in the marketplace, and call one to another, saying, We piped
to you, and you didn&rsquo;t dance. We mourned, and you didn&rsquo;t weep.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>For John the Baptist
came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, He has a
demon. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-34 verse" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>The Son of Man
has come eating and drinking, and you say, Behold, a gluttonous man,
and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-35 verse" verse="35">&#xF646;&#xF648;</SPAN>Wisdom is justified by all her
children.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-36 verse" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>One of the Pharisees
invited him to eat with him. He entered into the Pharisee&rsquo;s house, and
sat at the table. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-37 verse" verse="37">&#xF646;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Behold,
a woman in the city who was a sinner, when she knew that he was reclining
in the Pharisee&rsquo;s house, she brought an alabaster jar of ointment.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-38 verse" verse="38">&#xF646;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Standing behind at his
feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and she wiped them
with the hair of her head, kissed his feet, and anointed them with the
ointment. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-39 verse" verse="39">&#xF646;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Now when the
Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he said to himself, This man, if
he were a prophet, would have perceived who and what kind of woman this is
who touches him, that she is a sinner.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-40 verse" verse="40">&#xF647;&#xF643;</SPAN>Jesus answered him,
Simon, I have something to tell you.
<p>He said, Teacher, say on.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-41 verse" verse="41">&#xF647;&#xF644;</SPAN>A
certain lender had two debtors. The one owed five hundred denarii, and the
other fifty. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-42 verse" verse="42">&#xF647;&#xF645;</SPAN>When they
couldn&rsquo;t pay, he forgave them both. Which of them therefore will love
him most?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-43 verse" verse="43">&#xF647;&#xF646;</SPAN>Simon answered, He,
I suppose, to whom he forgave the most.
<p>He said to him, You have judged correctly.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-44 verse" verse="44">&#xF647;&#xF647;</SPAN>Turning to the woman, he
said to Simon, Do you see this woman? I entered into
your house, and you gave me no water for my feet, but she has wet my feet
with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-45 verse newline" verse="45">&#xF647;&#xF648;</SPAN>You gave me no kiss, but she,
since the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss my feet. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-46 verse" verse="46">&#xF647;&#xF649;</SPAN>You didn&rsquo;t anoint my head with
oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-47 verse" verse="47">&#xF647;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Therefore I tell you, her sins,
which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is
forgiven, the same loves little. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-48 verse" verse="48">&#xF647;&#xF64B;</SPAN>He said to her, Your sins are forgiven.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-49 verse" verse="49">&#xF647;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Those who sat at the
table with him began to say to themselves, Who is this who even
forgives sins?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-50 verse" verse="50">&#xF648;&#xF643;</SPAN>He said to the woman,
Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF640;</SPAN>It happened soon
afterwards, that he went about through cities and villages, preaching and
bringing the good news of the Kingdom of God. With him were the twelve,
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>and certain women who had
been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary who was called
Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>and Joanna, the wife of Chuzas,
Herod&rsquo;s steward, Susanna, and many others, who served them from their possessions. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>When a great multitude came
together, and people from every city were coming to him, he spoke by a
parable. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>The farmer went out to sow his seed. As he sowed, some fell
along the road, and it was trampled under foot, and the birds of the sky
devoured it. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>Other seed
fell on the rock, and as soon as it grew, it withered away, because it had
no moisture. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>Other fell
amid the thorns, and the thorns grew with it, and choked it. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-8 verse newline" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>Other fell into the good ground,
and grew, and brought forth fruit one hundred times. As he said
these things, he called out, He who has ears to hear,
let him hear!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>Then his disciples
asked him, What does this parable mean?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>He said, To you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of
God, but to the rest in parables, that seeing they may not see, and
hearing they may not understand. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>Now the parable is this: The seed
is the word of God. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>Those
along the road are those who hear, then the devil comes, and takes away
the word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>Those on the rock are they who,
when they hear, receive the word with joy, but these have no root, who
believe for a while, then fall away in time of temptation. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>That which fell among the thorns,
these are those who have heard, and as they go on their way they are
choked with cares, riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to
maturity. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>That in the
good ground, these are such as in an honest and good heart, having heard
the word, hold it tightly, and bring forth fruit with patience.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>No one, when he has lit a
lamp, covers it with a container, or puts it under a bed, but puts it on a
stand, that those who enter in may see the light. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>For nothing is hidden, that will
not be revealed, nor anything secret, that will not be known and come to
light. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Be careful
therefore how you hear. For whoever has, to him will be given, and whoever
doesn&rsquo;t have, from him will be taken away even that which he thinks he
has.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>His mother and
brothers came to him, and they could not come near him for the crowd.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>It was told him by some
saying, Your mother and your brothers stand outside, desiring to see

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>But he answered them,
My mother and my brothers are these who hear the word

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>Now it happened on one
of those days, that he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples, and
he said to them, Let&rsquo;s go over to the other side of
the lake. So they launched out. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>But as they sailed, he fell
asleep. A wind storm came down on the lake, and they were taking on
dangerous amounts of water. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>They came to him, and awoke him,
saying, Master, master, we are dying! He awoke, and rebuked the wind
and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and it was calm. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>He said to them, Where is your faith? Being afraid they marveled,
saying one to another, Who is this, then, that he commands even the
winds and the water, and they obey him? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>They arrived at the country of
the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>When Jesus stepped
ashore, a certain man out of the city who had demons for a long time met
him. He wore no clothes, and didn&rsquo;t live in a house, but in the tombs.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>When he saw Jesus, he
cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What
do I have to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I beg you,
don&rsquo;t torment me! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>For Jesus was commanding the
unclean spirit to come out of the man. For the unclean spirit had often
seized the man. He was kept under guard, and bound with chains and
fetters. Breaking the bands apart, he was driven by the demon into the
desert.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>Jesus asked him, What is your name?
<p>He said, Legion, for many demons had entered into him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>They begged him that he would not
command them to go into the abyss. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-32 verse newline" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>Now there was there a herd of
many pigs feeding on the mountain, and they begged him that he would allow
them to enter into those. He allowed them. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>The demons came out from the man,
and entered into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into
the lake, and were drowned. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-34 verse" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>When those who fed them saw what
had happened, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-35 verse" verse="35">&#xF646;&#xF648;</SPAN>People went out to see
what had happened. They came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the
demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus feet, clothed and in his right
mind, and they were afraid. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-36 verse newline" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>Those who saw it told them how he
who had been possessed by demons was healed. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-37 verse" verse="37">&#xF646;&#xF64A;</SPAN>All the people of the surrounding
country of the Gadarenes asked him to depart from them, for they were very
much afraid. He entered into the boat, and returned. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-38 verse" verse="38">&#xF646;&#xF64B;</SPAN>But the man from whom the demons
had gone out begged him that he might go with him, but Jesus sent him
away, saying, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-39 verse" verse="39">&#xF646;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Return to your house, and declare what great things God has
done for you. He went his way, proclaiming throughout the whole
city what great things Jesus had done for him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-40 verse" verse="40">&#xF647;&#xF643;</SPAN>It happened, when
Jesus returned, that the multitude welcomed him, for they were all waiting
for him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-41 verse" verse="41">&#xF647;&#xF644;</SPAN>Behold, there
came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue. He fell down
at Jesus feet, and begged him to come into his house, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-42 verse" verse="42">&#xF647;&#xF645;</SPAN>for he had an only daughter,
about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as he went, the
multitudes pressed against him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-43 verse" verse="43">&#xF647;&#xF646;</SPAN>A woman who had a flow of blood
for twelve years, who had spent all her living on physicians, and could
not be healed by any, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-44 verse" verse="44">&#xF647;&#xF647;</SPAN>came behind him, and touched the
fringe of his cloak, and immediately the flow of her
blood stopped. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-45 verse" verse="45">&#xF647;&#xF648;</SPAN>Jesus
said, Who touched me?
<p>When all denied it, Peter and those with him said, Master, the
multitudes press and jostle you, and you say, Who
touched me?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-46 verse" verse="46">&#xF647;&#xF649;</SPAN>But Jesus said, Someone did touch me, for I perceived that power has gone out
of me. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-47 verse" verse="47">&#xF647;&#xF64A;</SPAN>When the
woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down
before him declared to him in the presence of all the people the reason
why she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-48 verse" verse="48">&#xF647;&#xF64B;</SPAN>He said to her, Daughter, cheer up. Your faith has made you well. Go in
peace.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-49 verse" verse="49">&#xF647;&#xF64C;</SPAN>While he still spoke,
one from the ruler of the synagogue&rsquo;s house came, saying to him, Your
daughter is dead. Don&rsquo;t trouble the Teacher.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-50 verse" verse="50">&#xF648;&#xF643;</SPAN>But Jesus hearing it,
answered him, Don&rsquo;t be afraid. Only believe, and she
will be healed.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-51 verse" verse="51">&#xF648;&#xF644;</SPAN>When he came to the
house, he didn&rsquo;t allow anyone to enter in, except Peter, John, James,
the father of the child, and her mother. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-52 verse" verse="52">&#xF648;&#xF645;</SPAN>All were weeping and mourning
her, but he said, Don&rsquo;t weep. She isn&rsquo;t dead, but
sleeping.
<p>They were ridiculing
him, knowing that she was dead. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-54 verse range" verse="54">&#xF648;&#xF646;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF648;&#xF647;</SPAN>But he put them all outside, and
taking her by the hand, he called, saying, Child,
arise! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-55 verse" verse="55">&#xF648;&#xF648;</SPAN>Her
spirit returned, and she rose up immediately. He commanded that something
be given to her to eat. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-56 verse" verse="56">&#xF648;&#xF649;</SPAN>Her parents were amazed, but he
commanded them to tell no one what had been done.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF641;</SPAN>He called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority
over all demons, and to cure diseases. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>He sent them forth to preach the
Kingdom of God, and to heal the sick. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>He said to them, Take nothing for your journey&mdash;neither staffs, nor wallet,
nor bread, nor money, neither have two coats apiece. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>Into whatever house you enter,
stay there, and depart from there. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>As many as don&rsquo;t receive you,
when you depart from that city, shake off even the dust from your feet for
a testimony against them.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>They departed, and went
throughout the villages, preaching the Good News, and healing everywhere.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>Now Herod the tetrarch
heard of all that was done by him, and he was very perplexed, because it
was said by some that John had risen from the dead, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>and by some that Elijah had
appeared, and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>Herod said, John I
beheaded, but who is this, about whom I hear such things? He sought to
see him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>The apostles,
when they had returned, told him what things they had done.
<p>He took them, and withdrew apart to a deserted place of a city called
Bethsaida. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>But the
multitudes, perceiving it, followed him. He welcomed them, and spoke to
them of the Kingdom of God, and he cured those who needed healing. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>The day began to wear away, and
the twelve came, and said to him, Send the multitude away, that they
may go into the surrounding villages and farms, and lodge, and get food,
for we are here in a deserted place.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>But he said to them,
You give them something to eat.
<p>They said, We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we
should go and buy food for all these people. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>For they were about five thousand
men.
<p>He said to his disciples, Make them sit down in
groups of about fifty each. They did so, and made them all
sit down. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-16 verse range" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF648;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>He took the
five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to the sky, he blessed them,
and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the
multitude. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>They ate, and
were all filled. They gathered up twelve baskets of broken pieces that
were left over.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>It happened, as he was
praying alone, that the disciples were with him, and he asked them, Who do the multitudes say that I am?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>They answered,
John the Baptist, but others say, Elijah, and others, that
one of the old prophets is risen again.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>He said to them, But who do you say that I am?
<p>Peter answered, The Christ of God.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>But he warned them,
and commanded them to tell this to no one, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-22 verse newline" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>saying, The
Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, chief
priests, and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised
up.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>He said to all, If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself,
take up his cross, and follow me. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>For whoever desires to save his
life will lose it, but whoever will lose his life for my sake, the same
will save it. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>For what
does it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses or forfeits
his own self? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>For whoever
will be ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be
ashamed, when he comes in his glory, and the glory of the Father, and of
the holy angels. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>But I
tell you the truth: There are some of those who stand here, who will in no
way taste of death, until they see the Kingdom of God.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>It happened about
eight days after these sayings, that he took with him Peter, John, and
James, and went up onto the mountain to pray. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>As he was praying, the appearance
of his face was altered, and his clothing became white and dazzling.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>Behold, two men were
talking with him, who were Moses and Elijah, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>who appeared in glory, and spoke
of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at
Jerusalem.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>Now Peter and those
who were with him were heavy with sleep, but when they were fully awake,
they saw his glory, and the two men who stood with him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>It happened, as they were parting
from him, that Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be
here. Let&rsquo;s make three tents: one for you, and one for Moses, and one
for Elijah, not knowing what he said.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-34 verse" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>While he said these
things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they
entered into the cloud. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-35 verse" verse="35">&#xF646;&#xF648;</SPAN>A
voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son. Listen to
him! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-36 verse" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>When the voice
came, Jesus was found alone. They were silent, and told no one in those
days any of the things which they had seen.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-37 verse" verse="37">&#xF646;&#xF64A;</SPAN>It happened on the
next day, when they had come down from the mountain, that a great
multitude met him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-38 verse" verse="38">&#xF646;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Behold, a man from the crowd
called out, saying, Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my
only child. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-39 verse" verse="39">&#xF646;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Behold, a
spirit takes him, he suddenly cries out, and it convulses him so that he
foams, and it hardly departs from him, bruising him severely. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-40 verse" verse="40">&#xF647;&#xF643;</SPAN>I begged your disciples to cast
it out, and they couldn&rsquo;t.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-41 verse" verse="41">&#xF647;&#xF644;</SPAN>Jesus answered, Faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with
you and bear with you? Bring your son here.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-42 verse" verse="42">&#xF647;&#xF645;</SPAN>While he was still
coming, the demon threw him down and convulsed him violently. But Jesus
rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his
father. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-43 verse" verse="43">&#xF647;&#xF646;</SPAN>They were all
astonished at the majesty of God.
<p>But while all were marveling at all the things which Jesus did, he said
to his disciples, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-44 verse" verse="44">&#xF647;&#xF647;</SPAN>Let these words sink into your ears, for the Son of Man will
be delivered up into the hands of men. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-45 verse" verse="45">&#xF647;&#xF648;</SPAN>But they didn&rsquo;t understand this
saying. It was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it, and
they were afraid to ask him about this saying.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-46 verse" verse="46">&#xF647;&#xF649;</SPAN>There arose an
argument among them about which of them was the greatest. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-47 verse" verse="47">&#xF647;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Jesus, perceiving the reasoning
of their hearts, took a little child, and set him by his side, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-48 verse" verse="48">&#xF647;&#xF64B;</SPAN>and said to them, Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me.
Whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For whoever is least among
you all, this one will be great.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-49 verse" verse="49">&#xF647;&#xF64C;</SPAN>John answered,
Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we forbade
him, because he doesn&rsquo;t follow with us.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-50 verse" verse="50">&#xF648;&#xF643;</SPAN>Jesus said to him,
Don&rsquo;t forbid him, for he who is not against us is for
us.</div><div class="section E"><h2>Section E</h2>
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-51 verse" verse="51">&#xF648;&#xF644;</SPAN>It came to pass, when
the days were near that he should be taken up, he intently set his face to
go to Jerusalem, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-52 verse" verse="52">&#xF648;&#xF645;</SPAN>and sent
messengers before his face. They went, and entered into a village of the
Samaritans, so as to prepare for him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-53 verse" verse="53">&#xF648;&#xF646;</SPAN>They didn&rsquo;t receive him,
because he was traveling with his face set towards Jerusalem. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-54 verse" verse="54">&#xF648;&#xF647;</SPAN>When his disciples, James and
John, saw this, they said, Lord, do you want us to command fire to come
down from the sky, and destroy them, just as Elijah did?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-55 verse" verse="55">&#xF648;&#xF648;</SPAN>But he turned and
rebuked them, You don&rsquo;t know of what kind of spirit
you are. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-56 verse" verse="56">&#xF648;&#xF649;</SPAN>For the Son of
Man didn&rsquo;t come to destroy men&rsquo;s lives, but to save them.
<p>They went to another village. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-57 verse" verse="57">&#xF648;&#xF64A;</SPAN>As they went on the way, a
certain man said to him, I want to follow you wherever you go, Lord.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-58 verse" verse="58">&#xF648;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Jesus said to him,
The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have
nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-59 verse" verse="59">&#xF648;&#xF64C;</SPAN>He said to another,
Follow me!
<p>But he said, Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-60 verse" verse="60">&#xF649;&#xF643;</SPAN>But Jesus said to him,
Leave the dead to bury their own dead, but you go and
announce the Kingdom of God.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-61 verse" verse="61">&#xF649;&#xF644;</SPAN>Another also said,
I want to follow you, Lord, but first allow me to say good-bye to those
who are at my house.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-62 verse" verse="62">&#xF649;&#xF645;</SPAN>But Jesus said to him,
No one, having put his hand to the plow, and looking
back, is fit for the Kingdom of God.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF6DC;&#xF639;</SPAN>Now after these
things, the Lord also appointed seventy others, and sent them two by two

sackcloth and ashes. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-14 verse newline" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>But
it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>You, Capernaum, who are
exalted to heaven, will be brought down to Hades.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>Whoever listens to you
listens to me, and whoever rejects you rejects me. Whoever rejects me
rejects him who sent me.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>The seventy returned
with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your
name!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>He said to them,
I saw Satan having fallen like lightning from heaven.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Behold, I give you
authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of
the enemy. Nothing will in any way hurt you. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>Nevertheless, don&rsquo;t rejoice in
this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are
written in heaven.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>In that same hour
Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and said, I thank
you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things
from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to little children.
Yes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>Turning to the
disciples, he said, All things have been delivered to
me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is, except the Father, and who
the Father is, except the Son, and he to whomever the Son desires to
reveal him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>Turning to the
disciples, he said privately, Blessed are the eyes
which see the things that you see, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>for I tell you that many
prophets and kings desired to see the things which you see, and didn&rsquo;t
see them, and to hear the things which you hear, and didn&rsquo;t hear
them.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>Behold, a certain
lawyer stood up and tested him, saying, Teacher, what shall I do to
inherit eternal life?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>He said to him, What is written in the law? How do you read it?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>He answered, You
shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with
all your strength, and with all your mind, and your neighbor as
yourself.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>He said to him, You have answered correctly. Do this, and you will
live.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>But he, desiring to
justify himself, asked Jesus, Who is my neighbor?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>Jesus answered, A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and
he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed,
leaving him half dead. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>By chance a certain priest was
going down that way. When he saw him, he passed by on the other side.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>In the same way a Levite
also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>But a certain Samaritan,
as he traveled, came where he was. When he saw him, he was moved with
compassion, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-34 verse" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>came to him,
and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. He set him on his own
animal, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-35 verse" verse="35">&#xF646;&#xF648;</SPAN>On the next day, when he
departed, he took out two denarii, and gave them to the host, and said to
him, Take care of him. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will repay you
when I return. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-36 verse" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>Now
which of these three do you think seemed to be a neighbor to him who fell
among the robbers?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-37 verse" verse="37">&#xF646;&#xF64A;</SPAN>He said, He who
showed mercy on him.
<p>Then Jesus said to him, Go and do likewise.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-38 verse" verse="38">&#xF646;&#xF64B;</SPAN>It happened as they
went on their way, he entered into a certain village, and a certain woman
named Martha received him into her house. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-39 verse" verse="39">&#xF646;&#xF64C;</SPAN>She had a sister called Mary,
who also sat at Jesus feet, and heard his word. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-40 verse" verse="40">&#xF647;&#xF643;</SPAN>But Martha was distracted with
much serving, and she came up to him, and said, Lord, don&rsquo;t you care
that my sister left me to serve alone? Ask her therefore to help me.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-41 verse" verse="41">&#xF647;&#xF644;</SPAN>Jesus answered her,
Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many
things, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-42 verse" verse="42">&#xF647;&#xF645;</SPAN>but one thing is
needed. Mary has chosen the good part, which will not be taken away from
her.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF6DC;&#xF6DC;</SPAN>It happened, that when
he finished praying in a certain place, one of his disciples said to him,
Lord, teach us to pray, just as John also taught his disciples.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>He said to them, When you pray, say,
<dl>

<dt><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>Give us day by day
our daily bread.
<dt><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>Forgive us our sins,

<dd>but deliver us from the evil one.
</dl>
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>He said to them, Which of you, if you go to a friend at midnight, and tell
him, Friend, lend me three loaves of bread, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>for a friend of mine has come to
me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>and he from within will answer
and say, Don&rsquo;t bother me. The door is now shut, and my children are
with me in bed. I can&rsquo;t get up and give it to you? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>I tell you, although he will not
rise and give it to him because he is his friend, yet because of his
persistence, he will get up and give him as many as he needs.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>I tell you, keep asking, and
it will be given you. Keep seeking, and you will find. Keep knocking, and

He who seeks finds. To him who knocks it will be opened.

won&rsquo;t give him a snake instead of a fish, will he? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>Or if he asks for an egg, he
won&rsquo;t give him a scorpion, will he? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>If you then, being evil, know
how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly
Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>He was casting out a
demon, and it was mute. It happened, when the demon had gone out, the mute
man spoke, and the multitudes marveled. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>But some of them said, He
casts out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>Others, testing him, sought from
him a sign from heaven. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>But he, knowing their thoughts,
said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is
brought to desolation. A house divided against itself falls. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>If Satan also is divided against
himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by
Beelzebul. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>But if I cast
out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore
will they be your judges. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>But if I by the finger of God
cast out demons, then the Kingdom of God has come to you.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>When the strong man, fully
armed, guards his own dwelling, his goods are safe. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>But when someone stronger
attacks him and overcomes him, he takes from him his whole armor in which

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>He that is not with me is
against me. He who doesn&rsquo;t gather with me scatters. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>The unclean spirit, when he has
gone out of the man, passes through dry places, seeking rest, and finding
none, he says, I will turn back to my house from which I came out.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>When he returns, he
finds it swept and put in order. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>Then he goes, and takes seven
other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter in and dwell there.
The last state of that man becomes worse than the first.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>It came to pass, as
he said these things, a certain woman out of the multitude lifted up her
voice, and said to him, Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the
breasts which nursed you!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>But he said, On the contrary, blessed are those who hear the word of God,

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>When the multitudes
were gathering together to him, he began to say, This
is an evil generation. It seeks after a sign. No sign will be given to it
but the sign of Jonah, the prophet. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>For even as Jonah became a sign
to the Ninevites, so will also the Son of Man be to this generation.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>The Queen of the South
will rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and will
condemn them: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom
of Solomon, and behold, one greater than Solomon is here. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>The men of Nineveh will stand up
in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it: for they
repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, one greater than Jonah is
here.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>No one, when he has lit a
lamp, puts it in a cellar or under a basket, but on a stand, that those
who come in may see the light. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-34 verse newline" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>The lamp of the body is the eye.
Therefore when your eye is good, your whole body is also full of light,
but when it is evil, your body also is full of darkness. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-35 verse" verse="35">&#xF646;&#xF648;</SPAN>Therefore see whether the light
that is in you isn&rsquo;t darkness. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-36 verse" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>If therefore your whole body is
full of light, having no part dark, it will be wholly full of light, as
when the lamp with its bright shining gives you light.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-37 verse" verse="37">&#xF646;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Now as he spoke, a
certain Pharisee asked him to dine with him. He went in, and sat at the
table. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-38 verse" verse="38">&#xF646;&#xF64B;</SPAN>When the Pharisee
saw it, he marveled that he had not first washed himself before dinner.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-39 verse" verse="39">&#xF646;&#xF64C;</SPAN>The Lord said to him,
Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of

<SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-40 verse" verse="40">&#xF647;&#xF643;</SPAN>You foolish ones,
didn&rsquo;t he who made the outside make the inside also? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-41 verse" verse="41">&#xF647;&#xF644;</SPAN>But give for gifts to the needy

you. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-42 verse" verse="42">&#xF647;&#xF645;</SPAN>But woe to you
Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and every herb, but you bypass
justice and the love of God. You ought to have done these, and not to have
left the other undone. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-43 verse" verse="43">&#xF647;&#xF646;</SPAN>Woe to you Pharisees! For you
love the best seats in the synagogues, and the greetings in the
marketplaces. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-44 verse" verse="44">&#xF647;&#xF647;</SPAN>Woe to
you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like hidden graves,
and the men who walk over them don&rsquo;t know it.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-45 verse" verse="45">&#xF647;&#xF648;</SPAN>One of the lawyers
answered him, Teacher, in saying this you insult us also.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-46 verse" verse="46">&#xF647;&#xF649;</SPAN>He said, Woe to you lawyers also! For you load men with burdens that
are difficult to carry, and you yourselves won&rsquo;t even lift one finger to
help carry those burdens. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-47 verse" verse="47">&#xF647;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Woe to you! For you build the
tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-48 verse" verse="48">&#xF647;&#xF64B;</SPAN>So you testify and consent to
the works of your fathers. For they killed them, and you build their
tombs. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-49 verse" verse="49">&#xF647;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Therefore also
the wisdom of God said, I will send to them prophets and apostles, and
some of them they will kill and persecute, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-50 verse" verse="50">&#xF648;&#xF643;</SPAN>that the blood of all the
prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required
of this generation, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-51 verse" verse="51">&#xF648;&#xF644;</SPAN>from
the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah, who perished between the
altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, it will be required of this
generation. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-52 verse" verse="52">&#xF648;&#xF645;</SPAN>Woe to you
lawyers! For you took away the key of knowledge. You didn&rsquo;t enter in
yourselves, and those who were entering in, you hindered.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-53 verse" verse="53">&#xF648;&#xF646;</SPAN>As he said these
things to them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be terribly angry,
and to draw many things out of him, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-54 verse newline" verse="54">&#xF648;&#xF647;</SPAN>lying in wait for him, and
seeking to catch him in something he might say, that they might accuse him.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF6DC;&#xF63A;</SPAN>Meanwhile, when a
multitude of many thousands had gathered together, so much so that they
trampled on each other, he began to tell his disciples first of all, Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>But there is nothing
covered up, that will not be revealed, nor hidden, that will not be known.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>Therefore whatever you
have said in the darkness will be heard in the light. What you have spoken

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>I tell you, my friends,

will warn you whom you should fear. Fear him, who after he has killed, has

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>He said to his
disciples, Therefore I tell you, don&rsquo;t be anxious for
your life, what you will eat, nor yet for your body, what you will wear.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>Life is more than food,
and the body is more than clothing. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-24 verse newline" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>Consider the ravens: they
don&rsquo;t sow, they don&rsquo;t reap, they have no warehouse or barn, and God
feeds them. How much more valuable are you than birds! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>Which of you by being anxious
can add a cubit to his height? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>If then you aren&rsquo;t able to do
even the least things, why are you anxious about the rest? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Consider the lilies, how they
grow. They don&rsquo;t toil, neither do they spin, yet I tell you, even
Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>But if this is how God clothes
the grass in the field, which today exists, and tomorrow is cast into the
oven, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Don&rsquo;t seek what you will eat
or what you will drink, neither be anxious. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>For the nations of the world
seek after all of these things, but your Father knows that you need these
things. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>But seek God&rsquo;s
Kingdom, and all these things will be added to you. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-32 verse newline" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>Don&rsquo;t be afraid, little flock,

give gifts to the needy. Make for yourselves purses which don&rsquo;t grow

approaches, neither moth destroys. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-34 verse" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>For where your treasure is,
there will your heart be also.

them. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-38 verse" verse="38">&#xF646;&#xF64B;</SPAN>They will be

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-41 verse" verse="41">&#xF647;&#xF644;</SPAN>Peter said to him,
Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to everybody?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-42 verse" verse="42">&#xF647;&#xF645;</SPAN>The Lord said, Who then is the faithful and wise steward, whom his lord will

set him over all that he has. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-45 verse" verse="45">&#xF647;&#xF648;</SPAN>But if that servant says in his
heart, My lord delays his coming, and begins to beat the menservants
and the maidservants, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-46 verse" verse="46">&#xF647;&#xF649;</SPAN>then the lord of that servant
will come in a day when he isn&rsquo;t expecting him, and in an hour that he
doesn&rsquo;t know, and will cut him in two, and place his portion with the
unfaithful. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-47 verse" verse="47">&#xF647;&#xF64A;</SPAN>That
servant, who knew his lord&rsquo;s will, and didn&rsquo;t prepare, nor do what he
wanted, will be beaten with many stripes, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-48 verse" verse="48">&#xF647;&#xF64B;</SPAN>but he who didn&rsquo;t know, and
did things worthy of stripes, will be beaten with few stripes. To whomever
much is given, of him will much be required, and to whom much was
entrusted, of him more will be asked.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-49 verse" verse="49">&#xF647;&#xF64C;</SPAN>I came to throw fire on the

<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF6DC;&#xF63B;</SPAN>Now there were some
present at the same time who told him about the Galileans, whose blood
Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>Jesus answered them, Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>He spoke this parable.
A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard,
and he came seeking fruit on it, and found none. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>He said to the vine dresser,
Behold, these three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig
tree, and found none. Cut it down. Why does it waste the soil? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>He answered, Lord, leave it
alone this year also, until I dig around it, and fertilize it. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>If it bears fruit, fine, but if
not, after that, you can cut it down.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>He was teaching in
one of the synagogues on the Sabbath day. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>Behold, there was a woman who
had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and she was bent over, and could
in no way straighten herself up. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>When Jesus saw her, he called
her, and said to her, Woman, you are freed from your
infirmity. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>He
laid his hands on her, and immediately she stood up straight, and
glorified God.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>The ruler of the
synagogue, being indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, said
to the multitude, There are six days in which men ought to work.
Therefore come on those days and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>Therefore the Lord
answered him, You hypocrites! Doesn&rsquo;t each one of you
free his ox or his donkey from the stall on the Sabbath, and lead him away
to water? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>Ought not this
woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan had bound eighteen long
years, be freed from this bondage on the Sabbath day?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>As he said these
things, all his adversaries were disappointed, and all the multitude
rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>He said, What is the Kingdom of God like? To what shall I compare it?
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>It is like a grain of
mustard seed, which a man took, and put in his own garden. It grew, and
became a large tree, and the birds of the sky lodged in its branches.
<p>Again he said, To what shall
I compare the Kingdom of God? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-21 verse range" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF643;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>It is like yeast, which a woman
took and hid in three measures of flour, until it was
all leavened.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>He went on his way
through cities and villages, teaching, and traveling on to Jerusalem.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>One said to him,
Lord, are they few who are saved?
<p>He said to them, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>Strive to
enter in by the narrow door, for many, I tell you, will seek to enter in,
and will not be able. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>When once the master of the
house has risen up, and has shut the door, and you begin to stand outside,
and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us! then he
will answer and tell you, I don&rsquo;t know you or where you come from.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>Then you will begin to
say, We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our
streets. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>He will say,
I tell you, I don&rsquo;t know where you come from. Depart from me, all you
workers of iniquity. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>There will be weeping and
gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the
prophets, in the Kingdom of God, and yourselves being thrown outside.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>They will come from the
east, west, north, and south, and will sit down in the Kingdom of God.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>Behold, there are some
who are last who will be first, and there are some who are first who will
be last.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>On that same day,
some Pharisees came, saying to him, Get out of here, and go away, for
Herod wants to kill you.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>He said to them,
Go and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out demons and
perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I complete my mission.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>Nevertheless I must go
on my way today and tomorrow and the next day, for it can&rsquo;t be that a
prophet perish outside of Jerusalem.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-34 verse" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that
kills the prophets, and stones those who are sent to her! How often I
wanted to gather your children together, like a hen gathers her own brood
under her wings, and you refused! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-35 verse" verse="35">&#xF646;&#xF648;</SPAN>Behold, your house is left to
you desolate. I tell you, you will not see me, until you say, Blessed
is he who comes in the name of the Lord!
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF6DC;&#xF63C;</SPAN>It happened, when he
went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a Sabbath to
eat bread, that they were watching him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>Behold, a certain man who had
dropsy was in front of him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-3 verse newline" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>Jesus, answering, spoke to the
lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on
the Sabbath?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>But they were silent.
<p>He took him, and healed him, and let him go. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>He answered them, Which of you, if your son or an ox fell
into a well, wouldn&rsquo;t immediately pull him out on a Sabbath
day?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>They couldn&rsquo;t answer
him regarding these things.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>He spoke a parable to
those who were invited, when he noticed how they chose the best seats, and
said to them, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>When you are invited by anyone to a marriage feast, don&rsquo;t
sit in the best seat, since perhaps someone more honorable than you might
be invited by him, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-9 verse newline" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>and he
who invited both of you would come and tell you, Make room for this
person. Then you would begin, with shame, to take the lowest place.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>But when you are
invited, go and sit in the lowest place, so that when he who invited you
comes, he may tell you, Friend, move up higher. Then you will be
honored in the presence of all who sit at the table with you. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>For everyone who exalts himself
will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>He also said to the
one who had invited him, When you make a dinner or a
supper, don&rsquo;t call your friends, nor your brothers, nor your kinsmen,
nor rich neighbors, or perhaps they might also return the favor, and pay
you back. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>But when you
make a feast, ask the poor, the maimed, the lame, or the blind, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>and you will be blessed, because
they don&rsquo;t have the resources to repay you. For you will be repaid in
the resurrection of the righteous.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>When one of those who
sat at the table with him heard these things, he said to him, Blessed
is he who will feast in the Kingdom of God!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>But he said to him,
A certain man made a great supper, and he invited many
people. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>He sent out his
servant at supper time to tell those who were invited, Come, for
everything is ready now. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>They all as one began to make
excuses.
<p>The first said to him, I have bought a
field, and I must go and see it. Please have me excused.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Another said, I have
bought five yoke of oxen, and I must go try them out. Please have me
excused.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>Another said, I have
married a wife, and therefore I can&rsquo;t come.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>That servant came, and told
his lord these things. Then the master of the house, being angry, said to
his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and
bring in the poor, maimed, blind, and lame.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>The servant said, Lord, it
is done as you commanded, and there is still room.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>The lord said to the servant,
Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that
my house may be filled. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-24 verse newline" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>For I tell you that none of
those men who were invited will taste of my supper.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>Now great multitudes
were going with him. He turned and said to them, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>If anyone
comes to me, and doesn&rsquo;t disregard his own father,
mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters, yes, and his own life also,
he can&rsquo;t be my disciple. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Whoever doesn&rsquo;t bear his own
cross, and come after me, can&rsquo;t be my disciple. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>For which of you, desiring to
build a tower, doesn&rsquo;t first sit down and count the cost, to see if he
has enough to complete it? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Or perhaps, when he has laid a
foundation, and is not able to finish, everyone who sees begins to mock
him, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>saying, This man
began to build, and wasn&rsquo;t able to finish. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>Or what king, as he goes to
encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and consider
whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him
with twenty thousand? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>Or
else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends an envoy, and asks
for conditions of peace. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>So therefore whoever of you who
doesn&rsquo;t renounce all that he has, he can&rsquo;t be my disciple. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-34 verse" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>Salt is good, but if the salt
becomes flat and tasteless, with what do you season it? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c14">14</SPAN><SPAN class="v14-35 verse" verse="35">&#xF646;&#xF648;</SPAN>It is fit neither for the soil
nor for the manure pile. It is thrown out. He who has ears to hear, let
him hear.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF6DC;&#xF63D;</SPAN>Now all the tax
collectors and sinners were coming close to him to hear him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>The Pharisees and the scribes
murmured, saying, This man welcomes sinners, and eats with them.
<p>He told them this
parable. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-4 verse range" verse="4">&#xF646;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF647;</SPAN>Which of you men, if you had one hundred sheep, and lost one
of them, wouldn&rsquo;t leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after
the one that was lost, until he found it? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>When he has found it, he carries
it on his shoulders, rejoicing. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-6 verse newline" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>When he comes home, he calls
together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, Rejoice with
me, for I have found my sheep which was lost! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>I tell you that even so there
will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, than over
ninety-nine righteous people who need no repentance. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>Or what woman, if she had ten drachma coins, if she lost one drachma coin, wouldn&rsquo;t
light a lamp, sweep the house, and seek diligently until she found it?
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-9 verse newline" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>When she has found it,
she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, Rejoice with me,
for I have found the drachma which I had lost. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>Even so, I tell you, there is
joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner
repenting.
<p>He said, A certain man had two sons. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-12 verse range" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF644;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>The younger of them said to his
father, Father, give me my share of your property. He divided his
livelihood between them. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>Not many days after, the younger
son gathered all of this together and traveled into a far country. There
he wasted his property with riotous living. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>When he had spent all of it,
there arose a severe famine in that country, and he began to be in need.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>He went and joined
himself to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his
fields to feed pigs. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>He
wanted to fill his belly with the husks that the pigs ate, but no one gave
him any. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>But when he
came to himself he said, How many hired servants of my father&rsquo;s have
bread enough to spare, and I&rsquo;m dying with hunger! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>I will get up and go to my
father, and will tell him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in
your sight. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>I am no more
worthy to be called your son. Make me as one of your hired servants.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>He arose, and came to his
father. But while he was still far off, his father saw him, and was moved
with compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>The son said to him, Father,
I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight. I am no longer worthy to
be called your son.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>But the father said to his
servants, Bring out the best robe, and put it on him. Put a ring on his
hand, and shoes on his feet. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>Bring the fattened calf, kill
it, and let us eat, and celebrate, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>for this, my son, was dead, and
is alive again. He was lost, and is found. They began to celebrate.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>Now his elder son was in the
field. As he came near to the house, he heard music and dancing. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>He called one of the servants to
him, and asked what was going on. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>He said to him, Your brother
has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has
received him back safe and healthy. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>But he was angry, and would not
go in. Therefore his father came out, and begged him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>But he answered his father,
Behold, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed a
commandment of yours, but you never gave me a goat, that I might celebrate
with my friends. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>But
when this, your son, came, who has devoured your living with prostitutes,
you killed the fattened calf for him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>He said to him, Son, you
are always with me, and all that is mine is yours. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>But it was appropriate to
celebrate and be glad, for this, your brother, was dead, and is alive
again. He was lost, and is found.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF6DC;&#xF63E;</SPAN>He also said to his
disciples, There was a certain rich man who had a
manager. An accusation was made to him that this man was wasting his
possessions. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>He called
him, and said to him, What is this that I hear about you? Give an
accounting of your management, for you can no longer be manager.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>The manager said within
himself, What will I do, seeing that my lord is taking away the
management position from me? I don&rsquo;t have strength to dig. I am ashamed
to beg. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>I know what I
will do, so that when I am removed from management, they may receive me
into their houses. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>Calling each one of his lord&rsquo;s
debtors to him, he said to the first, How much do you owe to my
lord? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>He said, A hundred batos of oil. He said to him, Take your
bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>Then he said to another, How
much do you owe? He said, A hundred cors of
wheat. He said to him, Take your bill, and write eighty.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>His lord commended the
dishonest manager because he had done wisely, for the children of this
world are, in their own generation, wiser than the children of the light.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>I tell you, make for
yourselves friends by means of unrighteous mammon, so that when you fail,
they may receive you into the eternal tents. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>He who is faithful in a very
little is faithful also in much. He who is dishonest in a very little is
also dishonest in much. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>If therefore you have not been
faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true
riches? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>If you have not
been faithful in that which is another&rsquo;s, who will give you that which
is your own? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>No servant
can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one, and love the
other, or else he will hold to one, and despise the other. You aren&rsquo;t
able to serve God and mammon.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>The Pharisees, who
were lovers of money, also heard all these things, and they scoffed at
him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>He said to them,
You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of
men, but God knows your hearts. For that which is exalted among men is an
abomination in the sight of God. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>The law and the prophets were
until John. From that time the Good News of the Kingdom of God is
preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>But it is easier for heaven and
earth to pass away, than for one tiny stroke of a pen in the law to fall.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Everyone who divorces
his wife, and marries another, commits adultery. He who marries one who is
divorced from a husband commits adultery.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Now there was a certain rich
man, and he was clothed in purple and fine linen, living in luxury every
day. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>A certain beggar,
named Lazarus, was laid at his gate, full of sores, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>and desiring to be fed with the
crumbs that fell from the rich man&rsquo;s table. Yes, even the dogs came and
licked his sores. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>It
happened that the beggar died, and that he was carried away by the angels
to Abraham&rsquo;s bosom. The rich man also died, and was buried. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>In Hades, he
lifted up his eyes, being in torment, and saw Abraham far off, and Lazarus
at his bosom. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>He cried
and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he
may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue! For I am in
anguish in this flame.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>But Abraham said, Son,
remember that you, in your lifetime, received your good things, and
Lazarus, in the same way, bad things. But now here he is comforted and you
are in anguish. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>Besides
all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, that those who
want to pass from here to you are not able, and that none may cross over
from there to us.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>He said, I ask you
therefore, father, that you would send him to my father&rsquo;s house, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>for I have five brothers, that
he may testify to them, so they won&rsquo;t also come into this place of
torment.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>But Abraham said to him,
They have Moses and the prophets. Let them listen to them.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>He said, No, father
Abraham, but if one goes to them from the dead, they will repent.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>He said to him, If they
don&rsquo;t listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded
if one rises from the dead.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF6DC;&#xF63F;</SPAN>He said to the
disciples, It is impossible that no occasions of
stumbling should come, but woe to him through whom they come! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-2 verse newline" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>It would be better for him if a
millstone were hung around his neck, and he were thrown into the sea,
rather than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>Be careful. If your
brother sins against you, rebuke him. If he repents, forgive him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>If he sins against you seven
times in the day, and seven times returns, saying, I repent, you
shall forgive him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>The apostles said to
the Lord, Increase our faith.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>The Lord said, If you had faith like a grain of mustard seed, you would tell
this sycamore tree, Be uprooted, and be planted in the sea, and it
would obey you. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>But who
is there among you, having a servant plowing or keeping sheep, that will
say, when he comes in from the field, Come immediately and sit down at
the table, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>and will
not rather tell him, Prepare my supper, clothe yourself properly, and
serve me, while I eat and drink. Afterward you shall eat and drink?
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>Does he thank that
servant because he did the things that were commanded? I think not.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>Even so you also, when
you have done all the things that are commanded you, say, We are
unworthy servants. We have done our duty.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>It happened as he was
on his way to Jerusalem, that he was passing along the borders of Samaria
and Galilee. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>As he
entered into a certain village, ten men who were lepers met him, who stood
at a distance. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>They
lifted up their voices, saying, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>When he saw them, he
said to them, Go and show yourselves to the
priests. It happened that as they went, they were cleansed.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>One of them, when he saw
that he was healed, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>He fell on his face at Jesus
feet, giving him thanks, and he was a Samaritan. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Jesus answered, Weren&rsquo;t the ten cleansed? But where are the nine? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Were there none found who
returned to give glory to God, except this stranger? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Then he said to him, Get up, and go your way. Your faith has healed you.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>Being asked by the
Pharisees when the Kingdom of God would come, he answered them, The Kingdom of God doesn&rsquo;t come with observation, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>neither will they say, Look,
here! or, Look, there! for behold, the Kingdom of God is within
you.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>He said to the
disciples, The days will come, when you will desire to

here! or Look, there! Don&rsquo;t go away, nor follow after them,
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>for as the lightning,
when it flashes out of the one part under the sky, shines to the other
part under the sky, so will the Son of Man be in his day. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>But first, he must suffer many
things and be rejected by this generation. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>As it happened in the days of
Noah, even so will it be also in the days of the Son of Man. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>They ate, they drank, they
married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into
the ship, and the flood came, and destroyed them all. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Likewise, even as it happened in
the days of Lot: they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they
planted, they built, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>but
in the day that Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and sulfur from
the sky, and destroyed them all. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>It will be the same way in the
day that the Son of Man is revealed. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>In that day, he who will be on
the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them
away. Let him who is in the field likewise not turn back. Remember Lot&rsquo;s wife! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-33 verse range" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF645;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>Whoever seeks to save his life

asked him, Where, Lord?
<p>He said to them, Where the body is, there will the

<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF6DC;&#xF640;</SPAN>He also spoke a
parable to them that they must always pray, and not give up, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>saying, There
was a judge in a certain city who didn&rsquo;t fear God, and didn&rsquo;t respect
man. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>A widow was in that
city, and she often came to him, saying, Defend me from my
adversary! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>He
wouldn&rsquo;t for a while, but afterward he said to himself, Though I
neither fear God, nor respect man, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>yet because this widow bothers
me, I will defend her, or else she will wear me out by her continual
coming.
<p>The Lord said, Listen to what the unrighteous judge says. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-7 verse range" verse="7">&#xF649;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Won&rsquo;t God avenge his chosen

patience with them? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>I

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>He spoke also this
parable to certain people who were convinced of their own righteousness,
and who despised all others. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>Two men went
up into the temple to pray, one was a Pharisee, and the other was a tax
collector. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>The Pharisee
stood and prayed to himself like this: God, I thank you, that I am not
like the rest of men, extortioners, unrighteous, adulterers, or even like
this tax collector. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>I
fast twice a week. I give tithes of all that I get. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>But the tax collector, standing
far away, wouldn&rsquo;t even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast,
saying, God, be merciful to me, a sinner! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>I tell you, this man went down
to his house justified rather than the other, for everyone who exalts
himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be
exalted.

bringing their babies to him, that he might touch them. But when the
disciples saw it, they rebuked them. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>Jesus summoned them, saying,
Allow the little children to come to me, and don&rsquo;t
hinder them, for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Most certainly, I tell you,
whoever doesn&rsquo;t receive the Kingdom of God like a little child, he will
in no way enter into it.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>A certain ruler asked
him, saying, Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Jesus asked him,
Why do you call me good? No one is good, except
one&mdash;God. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>You know the
commandments: Don&rsquo;t commit adultery, Don&rsquo;t murder,
Don&rsquo;t steal, Don&rsquo;t give false testimony, Honor your
father and your mother.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>He said, I have
observed all these things from my youth up.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>When Jesus heard
these things, he said to him, You still lack one thing.
Sell all that you have, and distribute it to the poor. You will have
treasure in heaven. Come, follow me.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>But when he heard
these things, he became very sad, for he was very rich.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>Jesus, seeing that he
became very sad, said, How hard it is for those who
have riches to enter into the Kingdom of God! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>For it is easier for a camel to
enter in through a needle&rsquo;s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the
Kingdom of God.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>Those who heard it
said, Then who can be saved?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>But he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with
God.

we have left everything, and followed you.

Most certainly I tell you, there is no one who has left

God&rsquo;s sake, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>who will

Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the road, begging. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-36 verse" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>Hearing a multitude going by, he
asked what this meant. They told him that Jesus of

him, that he should be quiet, but he cried out all the more, You son of

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-40 verse" verse="40">&#xF647;&#xF643;</SPAN>Standing still, Jesus
commanded him to be brought to him. When he had come near, he asked him,
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-41 verse" verse="41">&#xF647;&#xF644;</SPAN>What
do you want me to do?
<p>He said, Lord, that I may see again.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-42 verse" verse="42">&#xF647;&#xF645;</SPAN>Jesus said to him,
Receive your sight. Your faith has healed you.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-43 verse" verse="43">&#xF647;&#xF646;</SPAN>Immediately he
received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God. All the people, when
they saw it, praised God.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF6DC;&#xF641;</SPAN>He entered and was
passing through Jericho. There was a man named Zacchaeus.
He was a chief tax collector, and he was rich. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>He was trying to see who Jesus
was, and couldn&rsquo;t because of the crowd, because he was short. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>He ran on ahead, and climbed up
into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was to pass that way. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>When Jesus came to the place, he
looked up and saw him, and said to him, Zacchaeus,
hurry and come down, for today I must stay at your house.
He hurried, came down,
and received him joyfully. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-7 verse range" verse="7">&#xF649;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF64A;</SPAN>When they saw it, they all
murmured, saying, He has gone in to lodge with a man who is a sinner.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>Zacchaeus stood and
said to the Lord, Behold, Lord, half of my goods I give to the poor. If
I have wrongfully exacted anything of anyone, I restore four times as

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>Jesus said to him,
Today, salvation has come to this house, because he
also is a son of Abraham. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>For the Son of Man came to seek
and to save that which was lost.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>As they heard these
things, he went on and told a parable, because he was near Jerusalem, and
they supposed that the Kingdom of God would be revealed immediately.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for
himself a kingdom, and to return. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>He called ten servants of his,

business until I come. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-14 verse newline" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>But his citizens hated him, and
sent an envoy after him, saying, We don&rsquo;t want this man to reign over
us.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>It happened when he had come
back again, having received the kingdom, that he commanded these servants,
to whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know
what they had gained by conducting business. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>The first came before him,
saying, Lord, your mina has made ten more minas.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>He said to him, Well done,

shall have authority over ten cities.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>The second came, saying,
Your mina, Lord, has made five minas.

behold, your mina, which I kept laid away in a handkerchief, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>for I feared you, because you
are an exacting man. You take up that which you didn&rsquo;t lay down, and
reap that which you didn&rsquo;t sow.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>He said to him, Out of
your own mouth will I judge you, you wicked servant! You knew that I am an
exacting man, taking up that which I didn&rsquo;t lay down, and reaping that
which I didn&rsquo;t sow. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>Then why didn&rsquo;t you deposit my
money in the bank, and at my coming, I might have earned interest on
it? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>He said to those
who stood by, Take the mina away from him, and give it to him who has
the ten minas.
<p>They said to him, Lord, he
has ten minas! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-26 verse range" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF648;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>For
I tell you that to everyone who has, will more be given, but from him who
doesn&rsquo;t have, even that which he has will be taken away from him.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>But bring those enemies
of mine who didn&rsquo;t want me to reign over them here, and kill them before

drew near to Bethsphage and Bethany, at the mountain
that is called Olivet, he sent two of his disciples, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>saying, Go
your way into the village on the other side, in which, as you enter, you

the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples

I tell you that if these were silent, the stones would

I also will ask you one question. Tell me: <SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-4 verse range" verse="4">&#xF646;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF647;</SPAN>the baptism of John, was it from
heaven, or from men?

that they didn&rsquo;t know where it was from.

<SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>He sent yet another
servant, and they also beat him, and treated him shamefully, and sent him
away empty. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>He sent yet
a third, and they also wounded him, and threw him out. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>The lord of the vineyard said,
What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. It may be that seeing him,

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>But when the farmers saw him,
they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir. Come, let&rsquo;s
kill him, that the inheritance may be ours. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>They threw him out of the

to them? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>He will come
and destroy these farmers, and will give the vineyard to others.

spies, who pretended to be righteous, that they might trap him in

died. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-33 verse range" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF645;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>Therefore in the
resurrection whose wife of them will she be? For the seven had her as a
wife.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-34 verse" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>Jesus said to them,
The children of this age marry, and are given in
marriage. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-35 verse" verse="35">&#xF646;&#xF648;</SPAN>But those who
are considered worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the
dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-36 verse" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>For they can&rsquo;t die any more,
for they are like the angels, and are children of God, being children of
the resurrection. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-37 verse" verse="37">&#xF646;&#xF64A;</SPAN>But
that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the bush, when he called
the Lord The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of
Jacob. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-38 verse" verse="38">&#xF646;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Now he is not the God of the
dead, but of the living, for all are alive to him.
<p>Some of the scribes
answered, Teacher, you speak well. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-40 verse range" verse="40">&#xF646;&#xF64C;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF647;&#xF643;</SPAN>They didn&rsquo;t dare to ask him
any more questions.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-41 verse" verse="41">&#xF647;&#xF644;</SPAN>He said to them,
Why do they say that the Christ is David&rsquo;s son?
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-42 verse" verse="42">&#xF647;&#xF645;</SPAN>David himself says in
the book of Psalms,

enemies the footstool of your feet.
</dl>
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-44 verse" verse="44">&#xF647;&#xF647;</SPAN>David therefore calls him
Lord, so how is he his son?
<p>In the hearing of all
the people, he said to his disciples, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-46 verse range" verse="46">&#xF647;&#xF648;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF647;&#xF649;</SPAN>Beware of the

marketplaces, the best seats in the synagogues, and the best places at
feasts, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-47 verse" verse="47">&#xF647;&#xF64A;</SPAN>who devour
widows houses, and for a pretense make long prayers: these will receive
greater condemnation.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF63A;&#xF6DC;</SPAN>He looked up, and saw
the rich people who were putting their gifts into the treasury. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>He saw a certain poor widow
casting in two small brass coins. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>He said, Truly
I tell you, this poor widow put in more than all of them, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>for all these put in gifts for
God from their abundance, but she, out of her poverty, put in all that she
had to live on.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>As some were talking
about the temple and how it was decorated with beautiful stones and gifts,
he said, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>As for these things which you see, the days will come, in
which there will not be left here one stone on another that will not be
thrown down.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>They asked him,
Teacher, so when will these things be? What is the sign that these
things are about to happen?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>He said, Watch out that you don&rsquo;t get led astray, for many will come
in my name, saying, I am he, and, The time is
at hand. Therefore don&rsquo;t follow them. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>When you hear of wars and

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>Then he said to them,
Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against

great earthquakes, famines, and plagues in various places. There will be
terrors and great signs from heaven. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>But before all these things,
they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you, delivering you up
to synagogues and prisons, bringing you before kings and governors for my
name&rsquo;s sake. It will
turn out as a testimony for you. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-14 verse range" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF646;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>Settle it therefore in your

wisdom which all your adversaries will not be able to withstand or to
contradict. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>You will be

not a hair of your head will perish.

win your lives.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>But when you see Jerusalem

sought how they might put him to death, for they feared the people.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>Satan entered into Judas,
who was surnamed Iscariot, who was numbered with the twelve. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>He went away, and talked with the
chief priests and captains about how he might deliver him to them. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>They were glad, and agreed to
give him money. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>He

of unleavened bread came, on which the Passover must be sacrificed.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>He sent Peter and John,
saying, Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may
eat.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>They said to him,
Where do you want us to prepare?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>He said to them,
Behold, when you have entered into the city, a man

he enters. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>Tell the

down with the twelve apostles. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>He said to them, I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before

you, I will no longer by any means eat of it until it is fulfilled in the
Kingdom of God. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>He received a cup, and when he

tell you, I will not drink at all again from the fruit of the vine, until

when he had given thanks, he broke it, and gave to them, saying, This is my body which is given for you. Do this in memory of
me. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>Likewise,

question among themselves, which of them it was who would do this thing.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>There arose also a
contention among them, which of them was considered to be greatest.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>He said to them, The kings of the nations lord it over them, and those who

is the greater among you, let him become as the younger, and one who is
governing, as one who serves. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>For who is greater, one who sits

continued with me in my trials. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>I confer on you a kingdom, even

Israel.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>The Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked to have you, that he might
sift you as wheat, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>but I
prayed for you, that your faith wouldn&rsquo;t fail. You, when once you have
turned again, establish your brothers.

When I sent you out without purse, and wallet, and

<p>They said, Nothing.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-36 verse" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>Then he said to them,
But now, whoever has a purse, let him take it, and
likewise a wallet. Whoever has none, let him sell his cloak, and buy a
sword. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-37 verse" verse="37">&#xF646;&#xF64A;</SPAN>For I tell you
that this which is written must still be fulfilled in me: He was

end.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-38 verse" verse="38">&#xF646;&#xF64B;</SPAN>They said, Lord,
behold, here are two swords.
<p>He said to them, That is enough.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-39 verse" verse="39">&#xF646;&#xF64C;</SPAN>He came out, and
went, as his custom was, to the Mount of Olives. His disciples also
followed him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-40 verse" verse="40">&#xF647;&#xF643;</SPAN>When he
was at the place, he said to them, Pray that you

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-41 verse" verse="41">&#xF647;&#xF644;</SPAN>He was withdrawn from
them about a stone&rsquo;s throw, and he knelt down and prayed, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-42 verse" verse="42">&#xF647;&#xF645;</SPAN>saying, Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me.
Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-43 verse" verse="43">&#xF647;&#xF646;</SPAN>An angel from heaven

earnestly. His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the
ground.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-45 verse" verse="45">&#xF647;&#xF648;</SPAN>When he rose up from

grief, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-46 verse" verse="46">&#xF647;&#xF649;</SPAN>and said to them,
Why do you sleep? Rise and pray that you may not enter

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-47 verse" verse="47">&#xF647;&#xF64A;</SPAN>While he was still

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-51 verse" verse="51">&#xF648;&#xF644;</SPAN>But Jesus answered,
Let me at least do this&mdash;and he touched his

led him away, and brought him into the high priest&rsquo;s house. But Peter
followed from a distance. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-55 verse" verse="55">&#xF648;&#xF648;</SPAN>When they had kindled a fire in

he was still speaking, a rooster crowed. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-61 verse" verse="61">&#xF649;&#xF644;</SPAN>The Lord turned, and looked at
Peter. Then Peter remembered the Lord&rsquo;s word, how he said to him, Before the rooster crows you will deny me three
times. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-62 verse" verse="62">&#xF649;&#xF645;</SPAN>He went
out, and wept bitterly.
<p>The men who held
Jesus mocked him and beat him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-64 verse range" verse="64">&#xF649;&#xF646;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF649;&#xF647;</SPAN>Having blindfolded him, they
struck him on the face and asked him, Prophesy! Who is the one who
struck you? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-65 verse" verse="65">&#xF649;&#xF648;</SPAN>They
spoke many other things against him, insulting him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-66 verse" verse="66">&#xF649;&#xF649;</SPAN>As soon as it was
day, the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together, both
chief priests and scribes, and they led him away into their council,
saying, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-67 verse" verse="67">&#xF649;&#xF64A;</SPAN>If you are
the Christ, tell us.
<p>But he said to them, If I tell you, you won&rsquo;t
believe, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-68 verse" verse="68">&#xF649;&#xF64B;</SPAN>and if I ask,
you will in no way answer me or let me go. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-69 verse" verse="69">&#xF649;&#xF64C;</SPAN>From now on, the Son of Man will
be seated at the right hand of the power of God.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-70 verse" verse="70">&#xF64A;&#xF643;</SPAN>They all said, Are
you then the Son of God?
<p>He said to them, You say it, because I am.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c22">22</SPAN><SPAN class="v22-71 verse" verse="71">&#xF64A;&#xF644;</SPAN>They said, Why do
we need any more witness? For we ourselves have heard from his own
mouth!
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF63A;&#xF63B;</SPAN>The whole company of
them rose up and brought him before Pilate. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>They began to accuse him, saying,
We found this man perverting the nation, forbidding paying taxes to
Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, a king.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>Pilate asked him,
Are you the King of the Jews?
<p>He answered him, So you say.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>Pilate said to the
chief priests and the multitudes, I find no basis for a charge against
this man.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>But they insisted,
saying, He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea,
beginning from Galilee even to this place. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>But when Pilate heard Galilee
mentioned, he asked if the man was a Galilean. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>When he found out that he was in
Herod&rsquo;s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem
during those days.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>Now when Herod saw
Jesus, he was exceedingly glad, for he had wanted to see him for a long
time, because he had heard many things about him. He hoped to see some
miracle done by him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>He
questioned him with many words, but he gave no answers. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>The chief priests and the
scribes stood, vehemently accusing him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>Herod with his soldiers
humiliated him and mocked him. Dressing him in luxurious clothing, they
sent him back to Pilate. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>Herod and Pilate became friends
with each other that very day, for before that they were enemies with each
other.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>Pilate called
together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>and said to them, You brought
this man to me as one that perverts the people, and see, I have examined
him before you, and found no basis for a charge against this man
concerning those things of which you accuse him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>Neither has Herod, for I sent
you to him, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>I will therefore chastise him
and release him.
<p>Now he had to release
one prisoner to them at the feast. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-18 verse range" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64A;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>But they all cried out together,
saying, Away with this man! Release to us Barabbas!&mdash;<SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>one who was thrown into prison
for a certain revolt in the city, and for murder.
<p>Then Pilate spoke to
them again, wanting to release Jesus, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-21 verse range" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF643;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>but they shouted, saying,
Crucify! Crucify him!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>He said to them the
third time, Why? What evil has this man done? I have found no capital
crime in him. I will therefore chastise him and release him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>But they were urgent with loud
voices, asking that he might be crucified. Their voices and the voices of
the chief priests prevailed. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>Pilate decreed that what they
asked for should be done. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>He released him who had been
thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but
he delivered Jesus up to their will.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>When they led him
away, they grabbed one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid
on him the cross, to carry it after Jesus. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>A great multitude of the people
followed him, including women who also mourned and lamented him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>But Jesus, turning to them,
said, Daughters of Jerusalem, don&rsquo;t weep for me, but
weep for yourselves and for your children. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>For behold, the days are coming
in which they will say, Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never
bore, and the breasts that never nursed. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>Then they will begin to tell the
mountains, Fall on us! and tell the hills, Cover us. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>For if they do these things in
the green tree, what will be done in the dry?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>There were also
others, two criminals, led with him to be put to death. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>When they came to the place that
is called The Skull, they crucified him there with the criminals, one on
the right and the other on the left.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-34 verse" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>Jesus said, Father, forgive them, for they don&rsquo;t know what they are
doing.
<p>Dividing his garments among them, they cast lots. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-35 verse" verse="35">&#xF646;&#xF648;</SPAN>The people stood watching. The
rulers with them also scoffed at him, saying, He saved others. Let him
save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen one!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-36 verse" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>The soldiers also
mocked him, coming to him and offering him vinegar, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-37 verse" verse="37">&#xF646;&#xF64A;</SPAN>and saying, If you are the
King of the Jews, save yourself!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-38 verse" verse="38">&#xF646;&#xF64B;</SPAN>An inscription was
also written over him in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew: THIS IS
THE KING OF THE JEWS.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-39 verse" verse="39">&#xF646;&#xF64C;</SPAN>One of the criminals
who was hanged insulted him, saying, If you are the Christ, save
yourself and us!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-40 verse" verse="40">&#xF647;&#xF643;</SPAN>But the other
answered, and rebuking him said, Don&rsquo;t you even fear God, seeing you
are under the same condemnation? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-41 verse" verse="41">&#xF647;&#xF644;</SPAN>And we indeed justly, for we
receive the due reward for our deeds, but this man has done nothing
wrong. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-42 verse" verse="42">&#xF647;&#xF645;</SPAN>He said to
Jesus, Lord, remember me when you come into your Kingdom.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-43 verse" verse="43">&#xF647;&#xF646;</SPAN>Jesus said to him,
Assuredly I tell you, today you will be with me in
Paradise.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-44 verse" verse="44">&#xF647;&#xF647;</SPAN>It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole
land until the ninth hour. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-45 verse" verse="45">&#xF647;&#xF648;</SPAN>The sun was darkened, and the
veil of the temple was torn in two. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-46 verse" verse="46">&#xF647;&#xF649;</SPAN>Jesus, crying with a loud voice,
said, Father, into your hands I commit my
spirit! Having said this, he breathed his last.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-47 verse" verse="47">&#xF647;&#xF64A;</SPAN>When the centurion
saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a
righteous man. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-48 verse" verse="48">&#xF647;&#xF64B;</SPAN>All
the multitudes that came together to see this, when they saw the things
that were done, returned home beating their breasts. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-49 verse" verse="49">&#xF647;&#xF64C;</SPAN>All his acquaintances, and the
women who followed with him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching
these things.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-50 verse" verse="50">&#xF648;&#xF643;</SPAN>Behold, a man named
Joseph, who was a member of the council, a good and righteous man <SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-51 verse" verse="51">&#xF648;&#xF644;</SPAN>(he had not consented to their
counsel and deed), from Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who was also
waiting for the Kingdom of God: <SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-52 verse" verse="52">&#xF648;&#xF645;</SPAN>this man went to Pilate, and
asked for Jesus body. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-53 verse" verse="53">&#xF648;&#xF646;</SPAN>He took it down, and wrapped it
in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone, where no
one had ever been laid. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-54 verse" verse="54">&#xF648;&#xF647;</SPAN>It was the day of the
Preparation, and the Sabbath was drawing near. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-55 verse" verse="55">&#xF648;&#xF648;</SPAN>The women, who had come with him
out of Galilee, followed after, and saw the tomb, and how his body was
laid. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c23">23</SPAN><SPAN class="v23-56 verse" verse="56">&#xF648;&#xF649;</SPAN>They returned, and
prepared spices and ointments. On the Sabbath they rested according to the
commandment.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF63A;&#xF63C;</SPAN>But on the first day
of the week, at early dawn, they and some others came to the tomb,
bringing the spices which they had prepared. They found the stone rolled away
from the tomb. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-3 verse range" verse="3">&#xF645;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF646;</SPAN>They
entered in, and didn&rsquo;t find the Lord Jesus body. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>It happened, while they were
greatly perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling
clothing. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>Becoming
terrified, they bowed their faces down to the earth.
<p>They said to them, Why do you seek the living among the dead?
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>He isn&rsquo;t here, but is
risen. Remember what he told you when he was still in Galilee, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>saying that the Son of Man must
be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the
third day rise again?
<p>They remembered his
words, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-9 verse range" verse="9">&#xF64B;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF64C;</SPAN>returned from the
tomb, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>Now they were Mary
Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary the mother of James. The other women with them
told these things to the apostles. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>These words seemed to them to be
nonsense, and they didn&rsquo;t believe them. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>But Peter got up and ran to the
tomb. Stooping and looking in, he saw the strips of linen lying by
themselves, and he departed to his home, wondering what had happened.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>Behold, two of them
were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was sixty stadia from Jerusalem. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>They talked with each other
about all of these things which had happened. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>It happened, while they talked
and questioned together, that Jesus himself came near, and went with them.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>But their eyes were kept
from recognizing him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>He
said to them, What are you talking about as you walk,
and are sad?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>One of them, named
Cleopas, answered him, Are you the only stranger in Jerusalem who
doesn&rsquo;t know the things which have happened there in these days?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>He said to them,
What things?
<p>They said to him, The things concerning Jesus, the Nazarene, who was
a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>and how the chief priests and
our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>But we were hoping that
it was he who would redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now
the third day since these things happened. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>Also, certain women of our
company amazed us, having arrived early at the tomb, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>and when they didn&rsquo;t find his
body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, who
said that he was alive. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>Some of us went to the tomb, and
found it just like the women had said, but they didn&rsquo;t see him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>He said to them,
Foolish men, and slow of heart to believe in all that
the prophets have spoken! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>Didn&rsquo;t the Christ have to
suffer these things and to enter into his glory? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Beginning from Moses and from
all the prophets, he explained to them in all the Scriptures the things
concerning himself. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>They
drew near to the village, where they were going, and he acted like he
would go further.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>They urged him,
saying, Stay with us, for it is almost evening, and the day is almost
over.
<p>He went in to stay with them. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>It happened, that when he had
sat down at the table with them, he took the bread and gave thanks.
Breaking it, he gave to them. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>Their eyes were opened, and they
recognized him, and he vanished out of their sight. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>They said one to another,
Weren&rsquo;t our hearts burning within us, while he spoke to us along the
way, and while he opened the Scriptures to us? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>They rose up that very hour,
returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and those
who were with them, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-34 verse" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>saying, The Lord is risen
indeed, and has appeared to Simon! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-35 verse" verse="35">&#xF646;&#xF648;</SPAN>They related the things that
happened along the way, and how he was recognized by them in the breaking
of the bread.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-36 verse" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>As they said these
things, Jesus himself stood among them, and said to them, Peace be to you.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-37 verse" verse="37">&#xF646;&#xF64A;</SPAN>But they were
terrified and filled with fear, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-38 verse" verse="38">&#xF646;&#xF64B;</SPAN>He said to them,
Why are you troubled? Why do doubts arise in your
hearts? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-39 verse" verse="39">&#xF646;&#xF64C;</SPAN>See my hands and
my feet, that it is truly me. Touch me and see, for a spirit doesn&rsquo;t
have flesh and bones, as you see that I have. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-40 verse" verse="40">&#xF647;&#xF643;</SPAN>When he had said this, he showed
them his hands and his feet. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-41 verse" verse="41">&#xF647;&#xF644;</SPAN>While they still didn&rsquo;t
believe for joy, and wondered, he said to them, Do you
have anything here to eat?
<p>They gave him a piece
of a broiled fish and some honeycomb. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-43 verse range" verse="43">&#xF647;&#xF645;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF647;&#xF646;</SPAN>He took them, and ate in front
of them. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-44 verse" verse="44">&#xF647;&#xF647;</SPAN>He said to
them, This is what I told you, while I was still with
you, that all things which are written in the law of Moses, the prophets,
and the psalms, concerning me must be fulfilled.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-45 verse" verse="45">&#xF647;&#xF648;</SPAN>Then he opened their
minds, that they might understand the Scriptures. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-46 verse" verse="46">&#xF647;&#xF649;</SPAN>He said to them, Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ
to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-47 verse" verse="47">&#xF647;&#xF64A;</SPAN>and that repentance and
remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations,
beginning at Jerusalem. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-48 verse" verse="48">&#xF647;&#xF64B;</SPAN>You are witnesses of these
things. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c24">24</SPAN><SPAN class="v24-49 verse" verse="49">&#xF647;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Behold, I send
forth the promise of my Father on you. But wait in the city of Jerusalem

<SPAN class="chapter">&#xF6DC;</SPAN>In the beginning was the
Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with
God. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-3 verse range" verse="3">&#xF645;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF646;</SPAN>All things were made
through him. Without him was not anything made that has been made. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>In him was life, and the life was
the light of men. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>The
light shines in the darkness, and the darkness hasn&rsquo;t overcome it. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>There came a man, sent from God,
whose name was John. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>The
same came as a witness, that he might testify about the light, that all
might believe through him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>He was not the light, but was sent
that he might testify about the light. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>The true light that enlightens
everyone was coming into the world.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>He was in the world,
and the world was made through him, and the world didn&rsquo;t recognize him.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>He came to his own, and
those who were his own didn&rsquo;t receive him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>But as many as received him, to
them he gave the right to become God&rsquo;s children, to those who believe in
his name: <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>who were born
not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of
God. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>The Word became
flesh, and lived among us. We saw his glory, such glory as of the one and
only Son of the Father, full of grace and truth. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>John testified about him. He
cried out, saying, This was he of whom I said, He who comes after me
has surpassed me, for he was before me. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>From his fullness we all received
grace upon grace. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>For the
law was given through Moses. Grace and truth were realized through Jesus
Christ. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-18 verse newline" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>No one has seen
God at any time. The one and only Son, who is in the
bosom of the Father, he has declared him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>This is John&rsquo;s
testimony, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask
him, Who are you?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>He declared, and
didn&rsquo;t deny, but he declared, I am not the Christ.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>They asked him,
What then? Are you Elijah?
<p>He said, I am not.
<p>Are you the prophet?
<p>He answered, No.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>They said therefore to
him, Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us.
What do you say about yourself?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>He said, I am the
voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the
Lord, as Isaiah the prophet said.
<p>The ones who had been
sent were from the Pharisees. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-25 verse range" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF647;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>They asked him, Why then do
you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>John answered them,
I baptize in water, but among you stands one whom you don&rsquo;t know.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>He is the one who comes
after me, who is preferred before me, whose sandal strap I&rsquo;m not worthy
to loosen. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-28 verse newline" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>These
things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>The next day, he saw
Jesus coming to him, and said, Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away
the sin of the world! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>This is he of whom I said,
After me comes a man who is preferred before me, for he was before
me. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>I didn&rsquo;t know
him, but for this reason I came baptizing in water: that he would be
revealed to Israel. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>John testified, saying, I have
seen the Spirit descending like a dove out of heaven, and it remained on
him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>I didn&rsquo;t recognize
him, but he who sent me to baptize in water, he said to me, On whomever
you will see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he
who baptizes in the Holy Spirit. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-34 verse" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>I have seen, and have testified
that this is the Son of God.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-35 verse" verse="35">&#xF646;&#xF648;</SPAN>Again, the next day,
John was standing with two of his disciples, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-36 verse newline" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>and he looked at Jesus as he
walked, and said, Behold, the Lamb of God! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-37 verse" verse="37">&#xF646;&#xF64A;</SPAN>The two disciples heard him
speak, and they followed Jesus. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-38 verse newline" verse="38">&#xF646;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Jesus turned, and saw them
following, and said to them, What are you looking
for?
<p>They said to him, Rabbi (which is to say, being interpreted,
Teacher), where are you staying?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-39 verse" verse="39">&#xF646;&#xF64C;</SPAN>He said to them, Come, and see.
<p>They came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that
day. It was about the tenth hour. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-40 verse" verse="40">&#xF647;&#xF643;</SPAN>One of the two who heard John,
and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter&rsquo;s brother. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-41 verse" verse="41">&#xF647;&#xF644;</SPAN>He first found his own brother,
Simon, and said to him, We have found the Messiah! (which is, being
interpreted, Christ). <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-42 verse" verse="42">&#xF647;&#xF645;</SPAN>He brought him to Jesus. Jesus
looked at him, and said, You are Simon the son of
Jonah. You shall be called Cephas (which is by interpretation,
Peter). <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-43 verse" verse="43">&#xF647;&#xF646;</SPAN>On the next day,
he was determined to go out into Galilee, and he found Philip. Jesus said
to him, Follow me. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-44 verse" verse="44">&#xF647;&#xF647;</SPAN>Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of
the city of Andrew and Peter. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-45 verse" verse="45">&#xF647;&#xF648;</SPAN>Philip found Nathanael, and said
to him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets,
wrote: Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-46 verse" verse="46">&#xF647;&#xF649;</SPAN>Nathanael said to him,
Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?
<p>Philip said to him, Come and see.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-47 verse" verse="47">&#xF647;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Jesus saw Nathanael
coming to him, and said about him, Behold, an Israelite
indeed, in whom is no deceit!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-48 verse" verse="48">&#xF647;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Nathanael said to him,
How do you know me?
<p>Jesus answered him, Before Philip called you, when
you were under the fig tree, I saw you.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-49 verse" verse="49">&#xF647;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Nathanael answered
him, Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are King of Israel!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-50 verse" verse="50">&#xF648;&#xF643;</SPAN>Jesus answered him,
Because I told you, I saw you underneath the fig
tree, do you believe? You will see greater things than these!
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c1">1</SPAN><SPAN class="v1-51 verse" verse="51">&#xF648;&#xF644;</SPAN>He said to him, Most certainly, I tell you, hereafter you will see heaven
opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of
Man.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF63A;</SPAN>The third day, there
was a marriage in Cana of Galilee. Jesus mother was there. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>Jesus also was invited, with his
disciples, to the marriage. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>When the wine ran out, Jesus
mother said to him, They have no wine.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>Jesus said to her,
Woman, what does that have to do with you and me? My
hour has not yet come.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>His mother said to the
servants, Whatever he says to you, do it. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-6 verse newline" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>Now there were six water pots of
stone set there after the Jews way of purifying, containing two or three metretes apiece. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>Jesus said to them, Fill the water pots with water. They filled them up
to the brim. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>He said to
them, Now draw some out, and take it to the ruler of
the feast. So they took it. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>When the ruler of the feast tasted
the water now become wine, and didn&rsquo;t know where it came from (but the
servants who had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the feast called the
bridegroom, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>and said to
him, Everyone serves the good wine first, and when the guests have
drunk freely, then that which is worse. You have kept the good wine until
now! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>This beginning of
his signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and revealed his glory, and his
disciples believed in him.</div><div class="section B"><h2>Section B</h2>
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>After this, he went
down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, his brothers, and his disciples,
and they stayed there a few days. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>The Passover of the Jews was at
hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-14 verse newline" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>He found in the temple those who
sold oxen, sheep, and doves, and the changers of money sitting. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>He made a whip of cords, and
threw all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen, and he poured
out the changers money, and overthrew their tables. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>To those who sold the doves, he
said, Take these things out of here! Don&rsquo;t make my
Father&rsquo;s house a marketplace! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>His disciples remembered that it
was written, Zeal for your house will eat me up.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>The Jews therefore
answered him, What sign do you show us, seeing that you do these
things?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Jesus answered them,
Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it
up.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>The Jews therefore
said, It took forty-six years to build this temple! Will you raise it
up in three days? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>But
he spoke of the temple of his body. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>When therefore he was raised from
the dead, his disciples remembered that he said this, and they believed
the Scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>Now when he was in
Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in his name,
observing his signs which he did. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>But Jesus didn&rsquo;t trust himself
to them, because he knew everyone, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c2">2</SPAN><SPAN class="v2-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>and because he didn&rsquo;t need for
anyone to testify concerning man, for he himself knew what was in man.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF63B;</SPAN>Now there was a man of
the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>The same came to him by night, and
said to him, Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for
no one can do these signs that you do, unless God is with him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>Jesus answered him,
Most certainly, I tell you, unless one is born anew, he can&rsquo;t see the Kingdom of God.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>Nicodemus said to him,
How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into
his mother&rsquo;s womb, and be born?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>Jesus answered, Most certainly I tell you, unless one is born of water and
spirit, he can&rsquo;t enter into the Kingdom of God! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>That which is born of the flesh is
flesh. That which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Don&rsquo;t marvel that I said to you,
You must be born anew. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-8 verse range" verse="8">&#xF64A;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF64B;</SPAN>The wind blows
where it wants to, and you hear its sound, but don&rsquo;t know where it comes
from and where it is going. So is everyone who is born of the
Spirit.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>Nicodemus answered him,
How can these things be?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>Jesus answered him,
Are you the teacher of Israel, and don&rsquo;t understand
these things? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>Most
certainly I tell you, we speak that which we know, and testify of that
which we have seen, and you don&rsquo;t receive our witness. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>If I told you earthly things and
you don&rsquo;t believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>No one has ascended into
heaven, but he who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man, who is in
heaven. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>As Moses lifted
up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted
up, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>that whoever believes
in him should not perish, but have eternal life. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>For God so loved the world, that
he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him should not
perish, but have eternal life. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>For God didn&rsquo;t send his Son
into the world to judge the world, but that the world should be saved
through him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>He who
believes in him is not judged. He who doesn&rsquo;t believe has been judged
already, because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son
of God. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>This is the
judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the
darkness rather than the light, for their works were evil. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>For everyone who does evil hates
the light, and doesn&rsquo;t come to the light, lest his works would be
exposed. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>But he who does
the truth comes to the light, that his works may be revealed, that they
have been done in God.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>After these things,
Jesus came with his disciples into the land of Judea. He stayed there with
them, and baptized. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>John
also was baptizing in Enon near Salim, because there was much water there.
They came, and were baptized. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>For John was not yet thrown into
prison. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>There arose
therefore a questioning on the part of John&rsquo;s disciples with some Jews
about purification. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>They
came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the
Jordan, to whom you have testified, behold, the same baptizes, and
everyone is coming to him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>John answered, A
man can receive nothing, unless it has been given him from heaven. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>You yourselves testify that I
said, I am not the Christ, but, I have been sent before him.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>He who has the bride is
the bridegroom, but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears
him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom&rsquo;s voice. This, my joy,
therefore is made full. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>He must increase, but I must
decrease. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>He who comes
from above is above all. He who is from the earth belongs to the earth,
and speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>What he has seen and heard, of
that he testifies, and no one receives his witness. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>He who has received his witness
has set his seal to this, that God is true. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-34 verse" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>For he whom God has sent speaks
the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without measure. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-35 verse" verse="35">&#xF646;&#xF648;</SPAN>The Father loves the Son, and has
given all things into his hand. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c3">3</SPAN><SPAN class="v3-36 verse" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>One who believes in the Son has
eternal life, but one who disobeys the Son won&rsquo;t see
life, but the wrath of God remains on him.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF63C;</SPAN>Therefore when the Lord
knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more
disciples than John <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>(although Jesus himself didn&rsquo;t

Galilee. He needed to pass
through Samaria. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-5 verse range" verse="5">&#xF647;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF648;</SPAN>So he
came to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the parcel of ground that
Jacob gave to his son, Joseph. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>Jacob&rsquo;s well was there. Jesus
therefore, being tired from his journey, sat down by the well. It was
about the sixth hour. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>A woman of Samaria came to draw
water. Jesus said to her, Give me a drink.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>For his disciples had gone
away into the city to buy food.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>The Samaritan woman
therefore said to him, How is it that you, being a Jew, ask for a drink
from me, a Samaritan woman? (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>Jesus answered her,
If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to
you, Give me a drink, you would have asked him, and he would have
given you living water.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>The woman said to him,
Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. From where
then have you that living water? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>Are you greater than our father,
Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, as did his children,
and his livestock?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>Jesus answered her,
Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again,
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>but whoever drinks of the
water that I will give him will never thirst again, but the water that I
will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal
life.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>The woman said to him,
Sir, give me this water, so that I don&rsquo;t get thirsty, neither come
all the way here to draw.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>Jesus said to her,
Go, call your husband, and come here.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>The woman answered,
I have no husband.
<p>Jesus said to her, You said well, I have no
husband, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>for you have
had five husbands, and he whom you now have is not your husband. This you
have said truly.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>The woman said to him,
Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-20 verse newline" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>Our fathers worshiped in this
mountain, and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where people
ought to worship.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>Jesus said to her,
Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when neither in this
mountain, nor in Jerusalem, will you worship the Father. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>You worship that which you
don&rsquo;t know. We worship that which we know, for salvation is from the
Jews. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>But the hour comes,
and now is, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit
and truth, for the Father seeks such to be his worshippers. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-24 verse newline" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>God is spirit, and those who
worship him must worship in spirit and truth.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>The woman said to him,
I know that Messiah comes, (he who is called Christ). When he has
come, he will declare to us all things.
<p>Jesus said to her,
I am he, the one who speaks to you. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-27 verse range" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF649;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>At this, his disciples came. They
marveled that he was speaking with a woman, yet no one said, What are
you looking for? or, Why do you speak with her? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>So the woman left her water pot,
and went away into the city, and said to the people, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Come, see a man who told me
everything that I did. Can this be the Christ?
<p>They went out of the
city, and were coming to him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-31 verse range" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF643;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>In the meanwhile, the disciples
urged him, saying, Rabbi, eat.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>But he said to them,
I have food to eat that you don&rsquo;t know
about.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>The disciples
therefore said one to another, Has anyone brought him something to
eat?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-34 verse" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>Jesus said to them,
My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to
accomplish his work. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-35 verse" verse="35">&#xF646;&#xF648;</SPAN>Don&rsquo;t you say, There are yet
four months until the harvest? Behold, I tell you, lift up your eyes,
and look at the fields, that they are white for harvest already. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-36 verse" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>He who reaps receives wages, and
gathers fruit to eternal life, that both he who sows and he who reaps may
rejoice together. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-37 verse" verse="37">&#xF646;&#xF64A;</SPAN>For in
this the saying is true, One sows, and another reaps. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-38 verse" verse="38">&#xF646;&#xF64B;</SPAN>I sent you to reap that for which
you haven&rsquo;t labored. Others have labored, and you have entered into
their labor.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-39 verse" verse="39">&#xF646;&#xF64C;</SPAN>From that city many of
the Samaritans believed in him because of the word of the woman, who
testified, He told me everything that I did. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-40 verse" verse="40">&#xF647;&#xF643;</SPAN>So when the Samaritans came to
him, they begged him to stay with them. He stayed there two days. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-41 verse" verse="41">&#xF647;&#xF644;</SPAN>Many more believed because of his
word. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-42 verse" verse="42">&#xF647;&#xF645;</SPAN>They said to the
woman, Now we believe, not because of your speaking, for we have heard
for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the
world.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-43 verse" verse="43">&#xF647;&#xF646;</SPAN>After the two days he
went out from there and went into Galilee. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-44 verse newline" verse="44">&#xF647;&#xF647;</SPAN>For Jesus himself testified that
a prophet has no honor in his own country. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-45 verse" verse="45">&#xF647;&#xF648;</SPAN>So when he came into Galilee, the
Galileans received him, having seen all the things that he did in
Jerusalem at the feast, for they also went to the feast. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-46 verse" verse="46">&#xF647;&#xF649;</SPAN>Jesus came therefore again to
Cana of Galilee, where he made the water into wine. There was a certain
nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-47 verse" verse="47">&#xF647;&#xF64A;</SPAN>When he heard that Jesus had come
out of Judea into Galilee, he went to him, and begged him that he would
come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-48 verse" verse="48">&#xF647;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Jesus therefore said to him,
Unless you see signs and wonders, you will in no way
believe.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-49 verse" verse="49">&#xF647;&#xF64C;</SPAN>The nobleman said to
him, Sir, come down before my child dies. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-50 verse newline" verse="50">&#xF648;&#xF643;</SPAN>Jesus said to him, Go your way. Your son lives. The man believed the
word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-51 verse" verse="51">&#xF648;&#xF644;</SPAN>As he was now going down, his
servants met him and reported, saying Your child lives! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-52 verse" verse="52">&#xF648;&#xF645;</SPAN>So he inquired of them the hour
when he began to get better. They said therefore to him, Yesterday at
the seventh hour, the fever left him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-53 verse" verse="53">&#xF648;&#xF646;</SPAN>So the father knew that it was at
that hour in which Jesus said to him, Your son
lives. He believed, as did his whole house. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c4">4</SPAN><SPAN class="v4-54 verse" verse="54">&#xF648;&#xF647;</SPAN>This is again the second sign
that Jesus did, having come out of Judea into Galilee.</div><div class="section C"><h2>Section C</h2>
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF63D;</SPAN>After these things,
there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>Now in Jerusalem by the sheep
gate, there is a pool, which is called in Hebrew, Bethesda, having
five porches. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>In these lay
a great multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, or paralyzed,
waiting for the moving of the water, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>for an angel went down at certain
times into the pool, and stirred up the water. Whoever stepped in first
after the stirring of the water was made whole of whatever disease he had.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>A certain man was there,
who had been sick for thirty-eight years. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>When Jesus saw him lying there,
and knew that he had been sick for a long time, he asked him, Do you want to be made well?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>The sick man answered
him, Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is
stirred up, but while I&rsquo;m coming, another steps down before me.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>Jesus said to him,
Arise, take up your mat, and walk.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>Immediately, the man
was made well, and took up his mat and walked.
<p>Now it was the Sabbath on that day. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>So the Jews said to him who was
cured, It is the Sabbath. It is not lawful for you to carry the mat.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>He answered them,
He who made me well, the same said to me, Take up
your mat, and walk.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>Then they asked him,
Who is the man who said to you, Take up your mat,
and walk?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>But he who was healed
didn&rsquo;t know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, a crowd being in the
place.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>Afterward Jesus found
him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, you are
made well. Sin no more, so that nothing worse happens to you.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>The man went away, and
told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>For this cause the Jews
persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill him, because he did these things on
the Sabbath. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>But Jesus
answered them, My Father is still working, so I am
working, too. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-18 verse newline" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>For this cause therefore the Jews
sought all the more to kill him, because he not only broke the Sabbath,
but also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Jesus therefore answered them,
Most certainly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing of
himself, but what he sees the Father doing. For whatever things he does,
these the Son also does likewise. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>For the Father has affection for
the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does. He will show him
greater works than these, that you may marvel. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>For as the Father raises the dead
and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom he desires.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>For the Father judges no
one, but he has given all judgment to the Son, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>that all may honor the Son, even
as they honor the Father. He who doesn&rsquo;t honor the Son doesn&rsquo;t honor
the Father who sent him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>Most certainly I tell you, he
who hears my word, and believes him who sent me, has eternal life, and
doesn&rsquo;t come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>Most certainly, I tell
you, the hour comes, and now is, when the dead will hear the Son of
God&rsquo;s voice, and those who hear will live. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>For as the Father has life in
himself, even so he gave to the Son also to have life in himself. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>He also gave him authority to
execute judgment, because he is a son of man. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-28 verse newline" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Don&rsquo;t marvel at this, for the
hour comes, in which all that are in the tombs will hear his voice,
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>and will come out, those
who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done
evil, to the resurrection of judgment. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>I can of myself do nothing. As I
hear, I judge, and my judgment is righteous, because I don&rsquo;t seek my own
will, but the will of my Father who sent me.
<p>If I testify about myself, my
witness is not valid. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-32 verse range" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF644;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>It
is another who testifies about me. I know that the testimony which he
testifies about me is true. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>You have sent to John, and he has
testified to the truth. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-34 verse" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>But the testimony which I receive
is not from man. However, I say these things that you may be saved.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-35 verse" verse="35">&#xF646;&#xF648;</SPAN>He was the burning and
shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-36 verse newline" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>But the testimony which I
have is greater than that of John, for the works which the Father gave me
to accomplish, the very works that I do, testify about me, that the Father
has sent me. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-37 verse" verse="37">&#xF646;&#xF64A;</SPAN>The Father
himself, who sent me, has testified about me. You have neither heard his

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-39 verse" verse="39">&#xF646;&#xF64C;</SPAN>You search the Scriptures,
because you think that in them you have eternal life, and these are they
which testify about me. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-40 verse" verse="40">&#xF647;&#xF643;</SPAN>Yet you will not come to me, that
you may have life. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-41 verse" verse="41">&#xF647;&#xF644;</SPAN>I
don&rsquo;t receive glory from men. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c5">5</SPAN><SPAN class="v5-42 verse" verse="42">&#xF647;&#xF645;</SPAN>But I know you, that you don&rsquo;t

<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF63E;</SPAN>After these things,
Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee, which is also
called the Sea of Tiberias. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>A great multitude followed him,
because they saw his signs which he did on those who were sick. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>Jesus went up into the mountain,
and he sat there with his disciples. Now the Passover, the feast of the
Jews, was at hand. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-5 verse range" verse="5">&#xF647;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#xF648;</SPAN>Jesus
therefore lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a great multitude was
coming to him, said to Philip, Where are we to buy
bread, that these may eat? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>This he said to test him, for he

Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>One of his disciples,
Andrew, Simon Peter&rsquo;s brother, said to him, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>There is a boy here who has
five barley loaves and two fish, but what are these among so many?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>Jesus said, Have the people sit down. Now there was much grass

given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to those
who were sitting down, likewise also of the fish as much as they desired.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>When they were filled, he

afraid. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>But he said to
them, It is I. Don&rsquo;t be
afraid. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>They
were willing therefore to receive him into the boat. Immediately the boat
was at the land where they were going.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>On the next day, the
multitude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no
other boat there, except the one in which his disciples had embarked, and
that Jesus hadn&rsquo;t entered with his disciples into the boat, but his
disciples had gone away alone. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>However boats from Tiberias came
near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given
thanks. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>When the
multitude therefore saw that Jesus wasn&rsquo;t there, nor his disciples, they
themselves got into the boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>When they found him on
the other side of the sea, they asked him, Rabbi, when did you come
here?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>Jesus answered them,
Most certainly I tell you, you seek me, not because you
saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves, and were filled. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Don&rsquo;t work for the food which
perishes, but for the food which remains to eternal life, which the Son of
Man will give to you. For God the Father has sealed him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>They said therefore to
him, What must we do, that we may work the works of God?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Jesus answered them,
This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom
he has sent.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>They said therefore to
him, What then do you do for a sign, that we may see, and believe you?
What work do you do? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>Our
fathers ate the manna in the wilderness. As it is written, He gave them
bread out of heaven to eat.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>Jesus therefore said
to them, Most certainly, I tell you, it wasn&rsquo;t Moses
who gave you the bread out of heaven, but my Father gives you the true
bread out of heaven. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>For
the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven, and gives life to
the world.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-34 verse" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>They said therefore to
him, Lord, always give us this bread.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-35 verse" verse="35">&#xF646;&#xF648;</SPAN>Jesus said to them,
I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will not be
hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-36 verse" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>But I told you that you have seen
me, and yet you don&rsquo;t believe. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-37 verse" verse="37">&#xF646;&#xF64A;</SPAN>All those whom the Father gives
me will come to me. He who comes to me I will in no way throw out. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-38 verse" verse="38">&#xF646;&#xF64B;</SPAN>For I have come down from heaven,
not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-39 verse" verse="39">&#xF646;&#xF64C;</SPAN>This is the will of my Father who
sent me, that of all he has given to me I should lose nothing, but should
raise him up at the last day. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-40 verse" verse="40">&#xF647;&#xF643;</SPAN>This is the will of the one who
sent me, that everyone who sees the Son, and believes in him, should have
eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-41 verse" verse="41">&#xF647;&#xF644;</SPAN>The Jews therefore
murmured concerning him, because he said, I am the
bread which came down out of heaven. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-42 verse" verse="42">&#xF647;&#xF645;</SPAN>They said, Isn&rsquo;t this Jesus,
the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How then does he say,
I have come down out of heaven?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-43 verse" verse="43">&#xF647;&#xF646;</SPAN>Therefore Jesus
answered them, Don&rsquo;t murmur among yourselves. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-44 verse" verse="44">&#xF647;&#xF647;</SPAN>No one can come to me unless the
Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up in the last day.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-45 verse" verse="45">&#xF647;&#xF648;</SPAN>It is written in the
prophets, They will all be taught by God. Therefore everyone who
hears from the Father, and has learned, comes to me. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-46 verse" verse="46">&#xF647;&#xF649;</SPAN>Not that anyone has seen the
Father, except he who is from God. He has seen the Father. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-47 verse" verse="47">&#xF647;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Most certainly, I tell you, he
who believes in me has eternal life. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-48 verse" verse="48">&#xF647;&#xF64B;</SPAN>I am the bread of life. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-49 verse" verse="49">&#xF647;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Your fathers ate the manna in the
wilderness, and they died. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-50 verse" verse="50">&#xF648;&#xF643;</SPAN>This is the bread which comes
down out of heaven, that anyone may eat of it and not die. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-51 verse" verse="51">&#xF648;&#xF644;</SPAN>I am the living bread which came
down out of heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever.
Yes, the bread which I will give for the life of the world is my
flesh.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-52 verse" verse="52">&#xF648;&#xF645;</SPAN>The Jews therefore
contended with one another, saying, How can this man give us his flesh
to eat?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-53 verse" verse="53">&#xF648;&#xF646;</SPAN>Jesus therefore said
to them, Most certainly I tell you, unless you eat the
flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you don&rsquo;t have life in
yourselves. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-54 verse" verse="54">&#xF648;&#xF647;</SPAN>He who eats
my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at
the last day. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-55 verse" verse="55">&#xF648;&#xF648;</SPAN>For my
flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-56 verse" verse="56">&#xF648;&#xF649;</SPAN>He who eats my flesh and drinks
my blood lives in me, and I in him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-57 verse" verse="57">&#xF648;&#xF64A;</SPAN>As the living Father sent me, and
I live because of the Father, so he who feeds on me, he will also live
because of me. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-58 verse" verse="58">&#xF648;&#xF64B;</SPAN>This is
the bread which came down out of heaven&mdash;not as our fathers ate the
manna, and died. He who eats this bread will live forever.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-59 verse" verse="59">&#xF648;&#xF64C;</SPAN>He said these things in
the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-60 verse" verse="60">&#xF649;&#xF643;</SPAN>Therefore many of his
disciples, when they heard this, said, This is a hard saying! Who can
listen to it?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-61 verse" verse="61">&#xF649;&#xF644;</SPAN>But Jesus knowing in
himself that his disciples murmured at this, said to them, Does this cause you to stumble? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-62 verse" verse="62">&#xF649;&#xF645;</SPAN>Then what if you would see the
Son of Man ascending to where he was before? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-63 verse" verse="63">&#xF649;&#xF646;</SPAN>It is the spirit who gives life.
The flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit, and
are life. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-64 verse" verse="64">&#xF649;&#xF647;</SPAN>But there are
some of you who don&rsquo;t believe. For Jesus knew from the
beginning who they were who didn&rsquo;t believe, and who it was who would
betray him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-65 verse" verse="65">&#xF649;&#xF648;</SPAN>He said,
For this cause have I said to you that no one can come
to me, unless it is given to him by my Father.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-66 verse" verse="66">&#xF649;&#xF649;</SPAN>At this, many of his
disciples went back, and walked no more with him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-67 verse" verse="67">&#xF649;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Jesus said therefore to the
twelve, You don&rsquo;t also want to go away, do
you?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-68 verse" verse="68">&#xF649;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Simon Peter answered
him, Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-69 verse" verse="69">&#xF649;&#xF64C;</SPAN>We have come to believe
and know that you are the Christ, the Son of the living God.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-70 verse" verse="70">&#xF64A;&#xF643;</SPAN>Jesus answered them,
Didn&rsquo;t I choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a
devil? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c6">6</SPAN><SPAN class="v6-71 verse" verse="71">&#xF64A;&#xF644;</SPAN>Now he
spoke of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, for it was he who would betray
him, being one of the twelve.</div><div class="section E"><h2>Section E</h2>
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF63F;</SPAN>After these things,
Jesus was walking in Galilee, for he wouldn&rsquo;t walk in Judea, because the
Jews sought to kill him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>Now the feast of the Jews, the
Feast of Booths, was at hand. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>His brothers therefore said to
him, Depart from here, and go into Judea, that your disciples also may
see your works which you do. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>For no one does anything in
secret, and himself seeks to be known openly. If you do these things,
reveal yourself to the world. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>For even his brothers didn&rsquo;t
believe in him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>Jesus therefore said to
them, My time has not yet come, but your time is always
ready. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>The world can&rsquo;t
hate you, but it hates me, because I testify about it, that its works are
evil. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>You go up to the
feast. I am not yet going up to this feast, because my time is not yet
fulfilled.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>Having said these
things to them, he stayed in Galilee. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>But when his brothers had gone up
to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly, but as it were in
secret. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>The Jews
therefore sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>There was much murmuring among
the multitudes concerning him. Some said, He is a good man. Others
said, Not so, but he leads the multitude astray. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>Yet no one spoke openly of him
for fear of the Jews. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>But
when it was now the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and
taught. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>The Jews
therefore marveled, saying, How does this man know letters, having
never been educated?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>Jesus therefore
answered them, My teaching is not mine, but his who
sent me. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>If anyone
desires to do his will, he will know about the teaching, whether it is
from God, or if I am speaking from myself. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>He who speaks from himself seeks
his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and
no unrighteousness is in him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Didn&rsquo;t Moses give you the law,
and yet none of you keeps the law? Why do you seek to kill me?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>The multitude
answered, You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>Jesus answered them,
I did one work, and you all marvel because of it.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>Moses has given you
circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers), and on the
Sabbath you circumcise a boy. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>If a boy receives circumcision on
the Sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with
me, because I made a man completely healthy on the Sabbath? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>Don&rsquo;t judge according to
appearance, but judge righteous judgment.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>Therefore some of them
of Jerusalem said, Isn&rsquo;t this he whom they seek to kill? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>Behold, he speaks openly, and
they say nothing to him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this
is truly the Christ? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>However we know where this man
comes from, but when the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes
from.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Jesus therefore cried
out in the temple, teaching and saying, You both know
me, and know where I am from. I have not come of myself, but he who sent
me is true, whom you don&rsquo;t know. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>I know him, because I am from
him, and he sent me.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>They sought therefore
to take him, but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet
come. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>But of the
multitude, many believed in him. They said, When the Christ comes, he
won&rsquo;t do more signs than those which this man has done, will he?
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>The Pharisees heard the
multitude murmuring these things concerning him, and the chief priests and
the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>Then Jesus said, I will be with you a little while longer, then I go to him
who sent me. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-34 verse" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>You will
seek me, and won&rsquo;t find me, and where I am, you can&rsquo;t come.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-35 verse" verse="35">&#xF646;&#xF648;</SPAN>The Jews therefore
said among themselves, Where will this man go that we won&rsquo;t find him?
Will he go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-36 verse" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>What is this word that he
said, You will seek me, and won&rsquo;t find me, and where
I am, you can&rsquo;t come?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-37 verse" verse="37">&#xF646;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Now on the last and
greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-38 verse" verse="38">&#xF646;&#xF64B;</SPAN>He who believes in me, as the
Scripture has said, from within him will flow rivers of living
water. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-39 verse" verse="39">&#xF646;&#xF64C;</SPAN>But he
said this about the Spirit, which those believing in him were to receive.
For the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus wasn&rsquo;t yet
glorified.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-40 verse" verse="40">&#xF647;&#xF643;</SPAN>Many of the multitude
therefore, when they heard these words, said, This is truly the
prophet. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-41 verse" verse="41">&#xF647;&#xF644;</SPAN>Others said,
This is the Christ. But some said, What, does the Christ come out
of Galilee? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-42 verse" verse="42">&#xF647;&#xF645;</SPAN>Hasn&rsquo;t the
Scripture said that the Christ comes of the seed of David, and from
Bethlehem, the village where David was? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-43 verse" verse="43">&#xF647;&#xF646;</SPAN>So there arose a division in the
multitude because of him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-44 verse" verse="44">&#xF647;&#xF647;</SPAN>Some of them would have arrested
him, but no one laid hands on him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-45 verse" verse="45">&#xF647;&#xF648;</SPAN>The officers therefore came to
the chief priests and Pharisees, and they said to them, Why didn&rsquo;t
you bring him?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-46 verse" verse="46">&#xF647;&#xF649;</SPAN>The officers answered,
No man ever spoke like this man!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-47 verse" verse="47">&#xF647;&#xF64A;</SPAN>The Pharisees
therefore answered them, You aren&rsquo;t also led astray, are you? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-48 verse" verse="48">&#xF647;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Have any of the rulers believed
in him, or of the Pharisees? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-49 verse" verse="49">&#xF647;&#xF64C;</SPAN>But this multitude that doesn&rsquo;t
know the law is accursed.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-50 verse" verse="50">&#xF648;&#xF643;</SPAN>Nicodemus (he who came
to him by night, being one of them) said to them, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-51 verse" verse="51">&#xF648;&#xF644;</SPAN>Does our law judge a man,
unless it first hears from him personally and knows what he does?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-52 verse" verse="52">&#xF648;&#xF645;</SPAN>They answered him,
Are you also from Galilee? Search, and see that no prophet has arisen
out of Galilee.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c7">7</SPAN><SPAN class="v7-53 verse" verse="53">&#xF648;&#xF646;</SPAN>Everyone went to his
own house, <SPAN class="chapter">&#xF640;</SPAN>but Jesus went
to the Mount of Olives. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>Now very early in the morning, he
came again into the temple, and all the people came to him. He sat down,
and taught them. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>The
scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman taken in adultery. Having set
her in the midst, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>they
told him, Teacher, we found this woman in adultery, in the very act.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>Now in our law, Moses
commanded us to stone such. What then do you say about her? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>They said this testing him, that
they might have something to accuse him of.
<p>But Jesus stooped down, and wrote on the ground with his finger.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>But when they continued
asking him, he looked up and said to them, He who is
without sin among you, let him throw the first stone at her.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>Again he stooped down, and
with his finger wrote on the ground.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>They, when they heard
it, being convicted by their conscience, went out one by one, beginning
from the oldest, even to the last. Jesus was left alone with the woman
where she was, in the middle. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>Jesus, standing up, saw her and
said, Woman, where are your accusers? Did no one
condemn you?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>She said, No one,

<p>Jesus said, Neither do I condemn you. Go your way.
From now on, sin no more.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>Again, therefore,
Jesus spoke to them, saying, I am the light of the
world.
He who follows me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the light
of life.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>The Pharisees
therefore said to him, You testify about yourself. Your testimony is
not valid.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>Jesus answered them,
Even if I testify about myself, my testimony is true,
for I know where I came from, and where I am going, but you don&rsquo;t know
where I came from, or where I am going. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>You judge according to the flesh.
I judge no one. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>Even if I
do judge, my judgment is true, for I am not alone, but I am with the
Father who sent me. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>It&rsquo;s also written in your law
that the testimony of two people is valid. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>I am one who testifies about
myself, and the Father who sent me testifies about me.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>They said therefore to
him, Where is your Father?
<p>Jesus answered, You know neither me, nor my Father.
If you knew me, you would know my Father also. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>Jesus spoke these words in the
treasury, as he taught in the temple. Yet no one arrested him, because his
hour had not yet come. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>Jesus said therefore again to
them, I am going away, and you will seek me, and you
will die in your sins. Where I go, you can&rsquo;t come.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>The Jews therefore
said, Will he kill himself, that he says, Where I am
going, you can&rsquo;t come?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>He said to them, You are from beneath. I am from above. You are of this world.
I am not of this world. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>I
said therefore to you that you will die in your sins, for unless you
believe that I am he, you will die in your
sins.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>They said therefore to
him, Who are you?
<p>Jesus said to them, Just what I have been saying to
you from the beginning. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>I
have many things to speak and to judge concerning you. However he who sent
me is true, and the things which I heard from him, these I say to the
world.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>They didn&rsquo;t
understand that he spoke to them about the Father. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Jesus therefore said to them,
When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will
know that I am he, and I do nothing of myself, but as my Father taught me,
I say these things. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>He
who sent me is with me. The Father hasn&rsquo;t left me alone, for I always do
the things that are pleasing to him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>As he spoke these
things, many believed in him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>Jesus therefore said to those
Jews who had believed him, If you remain in my word,
then you are truly my disciples. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>You will know the truth, and the
truth will make you free.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>They answered him,
We are Abraham&rsquo;s seed, and have never been in bondage to anyone. How
do you say, You will be made free?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-34 verse" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>Jesus answered them,
Most certainly I tell you, everyone who commits sin is
the bondservant of sin. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-35 verse" verse="35">&#xF646;&#xF648;</SPAN>A
bondservant doesn&rsquo;t live in the house forever. A son remains forever.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-36 verse" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>If therefore the Son
makes you free, you will be free indeed. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-37 verse" verse="37">&#xF646;&#xF64A;</SPAN>I know that you are Abraham&rsquo;s
seed, yet you seek to kill me, because my word finds no place in you.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-38 verse" verse="38">&#xF646;&#xF64B;</SPAN>I say the things which I
have seen with my Father, and you also do the things which you have seen
with your father.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-39 verse" verse="39">&#xF646;&#xF64C;</SPAN>They answered him,
Our father is Abraham.
<p>Jesus said to them, If you were Abraham&rsquo;s
children, you would do the works of Abraham. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-40 verse" verse="40">&#xF647;&#xF643;</SPAN>But now you seek to kill me, a
man who has told you the truth, which I heard from God. Abraham didn&rsquo;t
do this. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-41 verse" verse="41">&#xF647;&#xF644;</SPAN>You do the works
of your father.
<p>They said to him, We were not born of sexual immorality. We have one
Father, God.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-42 verse" verse="42">&#xF647;&#xF645;</SPAN>Therefore Jesus said
to them, If God were your father, you would love me,
for I came out and have come from God. For I haven&rsquo;t come of myself, but
he sent me. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-43 verse" verse="43">&#xF647;&#xF646;</SPAN>Why don&rsquo;t
you understand my speech? Because you can&rsquo;t hear my word. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-44 verse" verse="44">&#xF647;&#xF647;</SPAN>You are of your father, the
devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer
from the beginning, and doesn&rsquo;t stand in the truth, because there is no
truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks on his own, for he is a
liar, and its father. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-45 verse" verse="45">&#xF647;&#xF648;</SPAN>But
because I tell the truth, you don&rsquo;t believe me. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-46 verse" verse="46">&#xF647;&#xF649;</SPAN>Which of you convicts me of sin?
If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-47 verse" verse="47">&#xF647;&#xF64A;</SPAN>He who is of God hears the words
of God. For this cause you don&rsquo;t hear, because you are not of
God.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-48 verse" verse="48">&#xF647;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Then the Jews answered
him, Don&rsquo;t we say well that you are a Samaritan, and have a demon?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-49 verse" verse="49">&#xF647;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Jesus answered, I don&rsquo;t have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you
dishonor me. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-50 verse" verse="50">&#xF648;&#xF643;</SPAN>But I
don&rsquo;t seek my own glory. There is one who seeks and judges. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-51 verse" verse="51">&#xF648;&#xF644;</SPAN>Most certainly, I tell you, if a
person keeps my word, he will never see death.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-52 verse" verse="52">&#xF648;&#xF645;</SPAN>Then the Jews said to
him, Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets,
and you say, If a man keeps my word, he will never
taste of death. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-53 verse" verse="53">&#xF648;&#xF646;</SPAN>Are you greater than our father,
Abraham, who died? The prophets died. Who do you make yourself out to
be?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-54 verse" verse="54">&#xF648;&#xF647;</SPAN>Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who
glorifies me, of whom you say that he is our God. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-55 verse" verse="55">&#xF648;&#xF648;</SPAN>You have not known him, but I
know him. If I said, I don&rsquo;t know him, I would be like you, a
liar. But I know him, and keep his word. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-56 verse" verse="56">&#xF648;&#xF649;</SPAN>Your father Abraham rejoiced to
see my day. He saw it, and was glad.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-57 verse" verse="57">&#xF648;&#xF64A;</SPAN>The Jews therefore
said to him, You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen
Abraham?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-58 verse" verse="58">&#xF648;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Jesus said to them,
Most certainly, I tell you, before Abraham came into
existence, I AM.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c8">8</SPAN><SPAN class="v8-59 verse" verse="59">&#xF648;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Therefore they took up
stones to throw at him, but Jesus was hidden, and went out of the temple,
having gone through their midst, and so passed by.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF641;</SPAN>As he passed by, he saw
a man blind from birth. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>His disciples asked him, Rabbi,
who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>Jesus answered, Neither did this man sin, nor his parents, but, that the
works of God might be revealed in him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>I must work the works of him who
sent me, while it is day. The night is coming, when no one can work.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>While I am in the world, I
am the light of the world. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>When he had said this, he spat on
the ground, made mud with the saliva, anointed the blind man&rsquo;s eyes with
the mud, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>and said to him,
Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which means
Sent). So he went away, washed, and came back seeing. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>The neighbors therefore, and those
who saw that he was blind before, said, Isn&rsquo;t this he who sat and
begged? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>Others were
saying, It is he. Still others were saying, He looks like him.
<p>He said, I am he. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>They therefore were asking him,
How were your eyes opened?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>He answered, A man
called Jesus made mud, anointed my eyes, and said to me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash. So I went away
and washed, and I received sight.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>Then they asked him,
Where is he?
<p>He said, I don&rsquo;t know.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>They brought him who
had been blind to the Pharisees. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>It was a Sabbath when Jesus made
the mud and opened his eyes. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>Again therefore the Pharisees
also asked him how he received his sight. He said to them, He put mud
on my eyes, I washed, and I see.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>Some therefore of the
Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because he doesn&rsquo;t keep the
Sabbath. Others said, How can a man who is a sinner do such
signs? There was division among them. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Therefore they asked the blind
man again, What do you say about him, because he opened your eyes?
<p>He said, He is a prophet.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>The Jews therefore did
not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his
sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight,
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>and asked them, Is
this your son, whom you say was born blind? How then does he now see?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>His parents answered
them, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>but how he now sees, we don&rsquo;t
know, or who opened his eyes, we don&rsquo;t know. He is of age. Ask him. He
will speak for himself. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>His parents said these things
because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if any
man would confess him as Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>Therefore his parents
said, He is of age. Ask him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>So they called the man
who was blind a second time, and said to him, Give glory to God. We
know that this man is a sinner.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>He therefore answered,
I don&rsquo;t know if he is a sinner. One thing I do know: that though I
was blind, now I see.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>They said to him
again, What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>He answered them, I
told you already, and you didn&rsquo;t listen. Why do you want to hear it
again? You don&rsquo;t also want to become his disciples, do you?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>They insulted him and
said, You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>We know that God has spoken to
Moses. But as for this man, we don&rsquo;t know where he comes from.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>The man answered them,
How amazing! You don&rsquo;t know where he comes from, yet he opened my
eyes. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>We know that God
doesn&rsquo;t listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshipper of God, and
does his will, he listens to him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>Since the world began it has
never been heard of that anyone opened the eyes of someone born blind.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>If this man were not from
God, he could do nothing.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-34 verse" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>They answered him,
You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us? They threw
him out.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-35 verse" verse="35">&#xF646;&#xF648;</SPAN>Jesus heard that they
had thrown him out, and finding him, he said, Do you
believe in the Son of God?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-36 verse" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>He answered, Who is
he, Lord, that I may believe in him?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-37 verse" verse="37">&#xF646;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Jesus said to him,
You have both seen him, and it is he who speaks with
you.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-38 verse" verse="38">&#xF646;&#xF64B;</SPAN>He said, Lord, I
believe! and he worshiped him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-39 verse" verse="39">&#xF646;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Jesus said, I came into this world for judgment, that those who don&rsquo;t
see may see, and that those who see may become blind.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-40 verse" verse="40">&#xF647;&#xF643;</SPAN>Those of the Pharisees
who were with him heard these things, and said to him, Are we also
blind?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c9">9</SPAN><SPAN class="v9-41 verse" verse="41">&#xF647;&#xF644;</SPAN>Jesus said to them,
If you were blind, you would have no sin, but now you
say, We see. Therefore your sin remains.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF6DC;&#xF639;</SPAN>Most certainly, I tell you, one who doesn&rsquo;t enter by the
door into the sheep fold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a
thief and a robber. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>But
one who enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>The gatekeeper opens the gate for
him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name,
and leads them out. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>Whenever he brings out his own
sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his
voice. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>They will by no
means follow a stranger, but will flee from him, for they don&rsquo;t know the
voice of strangers. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>Jesus spoke this parable to them,
but they didn&rsquo;t understand what he was telling them.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>Jesus therefore said
to them again, Most certainly, I tell you, I am the
sheep&rsquo;s door. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>All who
came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep didn&rsquo;t listen to
them. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>I am the door. If
anyone enters in by me, he will be saved, and will go in and go out, and
will find pasture. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>The
thief only comes to steal, kill, and destroy. I came that they may have
life, and may have it abundantly. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>I am the good shepherd. The good
shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>He who is a hired hand, and not
a shepherd, who doesn&rsquo;t own the sheep, sees the wolf coming, leaves the
sheep, and flees. The wolf snatches the sheep, and scatters them. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>The hired hand flees because he
is a hired hand, and doesn&rsquo;t care for the sheep. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>I am the good shepherd. I know
my own, and I&rsquo;m known by my own, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>even as the Father knows me, and
I know the Father. I lay down my life for the sheep. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>I have other sheep, which are
not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will hear
my voice. They will become one flock with one shepherd. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Therefore the Father loves me,
because I lay down my life, that I may take it again. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>No one takes it away from me,
but I lay it down by myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power
to take it again. I received this commandment from my Father.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Therefore a division
arose again among the Jews because of these words. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>Many of them said, He has a
demon, and is insane! Why do you listen to him? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>Others said, These are not
the sayings of one possessed by a demon. It isn&rsquo;t possible for a demon
to open the eyes of the blind, is it?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>It was the Feast of the Dedication at Jerusalem. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>It was winter, and Jesus was
walking in the temple, in Solomon&rsquo;s porch. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>The Jews therefore came around
him and said to him, How long will you hold us in suspense? If you are
the Christ, tell us plainly.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>Jesus answered them,
I told you, and you don&rsquo;t believe. The works that I
do in my Father&rsquo;s name, these testify about me. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>But you don&rsquo;t believe, because
you are not of my sheep, as I told you. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>My sheep hear my voice, and I
know them, and they follow me. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>I give eternal life to them.
They will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>My Father, who has given
them to me, is greater than all. No one is able to snatch them out of my

the Father are one.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>Therefore Jews took
up stones again to stone him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>Jesus answered them, I have shown you many good works from my Father. For which of
those works do you stone me?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>The Jews answered
him, We don&rsquo;t stone you for a good work, but for blasphemy: because
you, being a man, make yourself God.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-34 verse" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>Jesus answered them,
Isn&rsquo;t it written in your law, I said, you are
gods? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-35 verse" verse="35">&#xF646;&#xF648;</SPAN>If he called them gods, to whom
the word of God came (and the Scripture can&rsquo;t be broken), <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-36 verse" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>do you say of him whom the

don&rsquo;t believe me, believe the works, that you may know and believe that

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-39 verse" verse="39">&#xF646;&#xF64C;</SPAN>They sought again to
seize him, and he went out of their hand. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-40 verse" verse="40">&#xF647;&#xF643;</SPAN>He went away again beyond the

stayed. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c10">10</SPAN><SPAN class="v10-41 verse" verse="41">&#xF647;&#xF644;</SPAN>Many came to

<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF6DC;&#xF6DC;</SPAN>Now a certain man was
sick, Lazarus from Bethany, of the village of Mary and her sister, Martha.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>It was that Mary who had
anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose
brother, Lazarus, was sick. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>The sisters therefore sent to
him, saying, Lord, behold, he for whom you have great affection is
sick. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>But when Jesus
heard it, he said, This sickness is not to death, but
for the glory of God, that God&rsquo;s Son may be glorified by it.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>Now Jesus loved Martha,
and her sister, and Lazarus. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>When therefore he heard that he
was sick, he stayed two days in the place where he was. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>Then after this he said to the
disciples, Let&rsquo;s go into Judea again.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>The disciples told
him, Rabbi, the Jews were just trying to stone you, and are you going
there again?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>Jesus answered, Aren&rsquo;t there twelve hours of daylight? If a man walks in
the day, he doesn&rsquo;t stumble, because he sees the light of this world.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>But if a man walks in
the night, he stumbles, because the light isn&rsquo;t in him.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>He said these things,
and after that, he said to them, Our friend, Lazarus,
has fallen asleep, but I am going so that I may awake him out of
sleep.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>The disciples
therefore said, Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>Now Jesus had spoken
of his death, but they thought that he spoke of taking rest in sleep.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>So Jesus said to them
plainly then, Lazarus is dead. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>I am glad for your sakes that I
was not there, so that you may believe. Nevertheless, let&rsquo;s go to
him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>Thomas therefore, who
is called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples,
Let&rsquo;s go also, that we may die with him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>So when Jesus came,
he found that he had been in the tomb four days already. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Now Bethany was near Jerusalem,
about fifteen stadia away. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Many of the Jews had joined the
women around Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>Then when Martha heard
that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, but Mary stayed in the house.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>Therefore Martha said to
Jesus, Lord, if you would have been here, my brother wouldn&rsquo;t have
died. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>Even now I know
that, whatever you ask of God, God will give you. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>Jesus said to her, Your brother will rise again.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>Martha said to him,
I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>Jesus said to her,
I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in
me will still live, even if he dies. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>Whoever lives and believes in me
will never die. Do you believe this?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>She said to him,
Yes, Lord. I have come to believe that you are the Christ, God&rsquo;s Son,
he who comes into the world.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>When she had said
this, she went away, and called Mary, her sister, secretly, saying, The
Teacher is here, and is calling you.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>When she heard this,
she arose quickly, and went to him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>Now Jesus had not yet come into
the village, but was in the place where Martha met him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>Then the Jews who were with her
in the house, and were consoling her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up
quickly and went out, followed her, saying, She is going to the tomb to
weep there. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>Therefore
when Mary came to where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet,
saying to him, Lord, if you would have been here, my brother wouldn&rsquo;t
have died.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>When Jesus therefore
saw her weeping, and the Jews weeping who came with her, he groaned in the
spirit, and was troubled, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-34 verse" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>and said, Where have you laid him?
<p>They told him, Lord, come and see.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-35 verse" verse="35">&#xF646;&#xF648;</SPAN>Jesus wept.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-36 verse" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>The Jews therefore
said, See how much affection he had for him! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-37 verse" verse="37">&#xF646;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Some of them said, Couldn&rsquo;t
this man, who opened the eyes of him who was blind, have also kept this
man from dying?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-38 verse" verse="38">&#xF646;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Jesus therefore,
again groaning in himself, came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a
stone lay against it. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-39 verse" verse="39">&#xF646;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Jesus said, Take away the stone.
<p>Martha, the sister of him who was dead, said to him, Lord, by this
time there is a stench, for he has been dead four days.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-40 verse" verse="40">&#xF647;&#xF643;</SPAN>Jesus said to her,
Didn&rsquo;t I tell you that if you believed, you would see
God&rsquo;s glory?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-41 verse" verse="41">&#xF647;&#xF644;</SPAN>So they took away the
stone from the place where the dead man was lying.
Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank you
that you listened to me. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-42 verse" verse="42">&#xF647;&#xF645;</SPAN>I know that you always listen to
me, but because of the multitude that stands around I said this, that they
may believe that you sent me. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-43 verse" verse="43">&#xF647;&#xF646;</SPAN>When he had said this, he cried
with a loud voice, Lazarus, come out!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-44 verse" verse="44">&#xF647;&#xF647;</SPAN>He who was dead came
out, bound hand and foot with wrappings, and his face was wrapped around
with a cloth.
<p>Jesus said to them, Free him, and let him
go.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-45 verse" verse="45">&#xF647;&#xF648;</SPAN>Therefore many of the
Jews, who came to Mary and saw what Jesus did, believed in him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-46 verse" verse="46">&#xF647;&#xF649;</SPAN>But some of them went away to
the Pharisees, and told them the things which Jesus had done. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-47 verse" verse="47">&#xF647;&#xF64A;</SPAN>The chief priests therefore and
the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, What are we doing? For this
man does many signs. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-48 verse" verse="48">&#xF647;&#xF64B;</SPAN>If
we leave him alone like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans
will come and take away both our place and our nation.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-49 verse" verse="49">&#xF647;&#xF64C;</SPAN>But a certain one of
them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, You know
nothing at all, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-50 verse" verse="50">&#xF648;&#xF643;</SPAN>nor do
you consider that it is advantageous for us that one man should die for
the people, and that the whole nation not perish. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-51 verse" verse="51">&#xF648;&#xF644;</SPAN>Now he didn&rsquo;t say this of
himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus would
die for the nation, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-52 verse" verse="52">&#xF648;&#xF645;</SPAN>and
not for the nation only, but that he might also gather together into one
the children of God who are scattered abroad. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-53 verse" verse="53">&#xF648;&#xF646;</SPAN>So from that day forward they
took counsel that they might put him to death. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-54 verse" verse="54">&#xF648;&#xF647;</SPAN>Jesus therefore walked no more
openly among the Jews, but departed from there into the country near the
wilderness, to a city called Ephraim. He stayed there with his disciples.</div><div class="section G"><h2>Section G</h2>
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-55 verse" verse="55">&#xF648;&#xF648;</SPAN>Now the Passover of
the Jews was at hand. Many went up from the country to Jerusalem before
the Passover, to purify themselves. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-56 verse" verse="56">&#xF648;&#xF649;</SPAN>Then they sought for Jesus and
spoke one with another, as they stood in the temple, What do you
think&mdash;that he isn&rsquo;t coming to the feast at all? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c11">11</SPAN><SPAN class="v11-57 verse" verse="57">&#xF648;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Now the chief priests and the
Pharisees had commanded that if anyone knew where he was, he should report
it, that they might seize him.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF6DC;&#xF63A;</SPAN>Then six days before
the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, who had been dead,
whom he raised from the dead. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>So they made him a supper there.
Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with him.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>Mary, therefore, took a
pound of ointment of pure nard, very precious, and
anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair. The house
was filled with the fragrance of the ointment. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>Then Judas Iscariot, Simon&rsquo;s
son, one of his disciples, who would betray him, said, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>Why wasn&rsquo;t this ointment
sold for three hundred denarii, and given to the
poor? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>Now he said
this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and
having the money box, used to steal what was put into it. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>But Jesus said, Leave her alone. She has kept this for the day of my burial.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>For you always have the
poor with you, but you don&rsquo;t always have me.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>A large crowd
therefore of the Jews learned that he was there, and they came, not for
Jesus sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had
raised from the dead. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>But the chief priests conspired
to put Lazarus to death also, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>because on account of him many
of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>On the next day a
great multitude had come to the feast. When they heard that Jesus was
coming to Jerusalem, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>they took the branches of the
palm trees, and went out to meet him, and cried out, Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the
Lord,
the King of Israel!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>Jesus, having found a
young donkey, sat on it. As it is written, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>Don&rsquo;t be afraid, daughter
of Zion. Behold, your King comes, sitting on a donkey&rsquo;s colt. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>His disciples didn&rsquo;t
understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they
remembered that these things were written about him, and that they had
done these things to him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>The multitude therefore that was
with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the
dead, was testifying about it. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>For this cause also the
multitude went and met him, because they heard that he had done this sign.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>The Pharisees therefore
said among themselves, See how you accomplish nothing. Behold, the
world has gone after him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>Now there were
certain Greeks among those that went up to worship at the feast. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>These, therefore, came to
Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir,
we want to see Jesus. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>Philip came and told Andrew, and
in turn, Andrew came with Philip, and they told Jesus. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>Jesus answered them, The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>Most certainly I tell you,
unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains by

<p>Then there came a voice out of the sky, saying, I have both
glorified it, and will glorify it again.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>The multitude
therefore, who stood by and heard it, said that it had thundered. Others
said, An angel has spoken to him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>Jesus answered, This voice hasn&rsquo;t come for my sake, but for your sakes.

say, The Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is
this Son of Man?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-35 verse" verse="35">&#xF646;&#xF648;</SPAN>Jesus therefore said
to them, Yet a little while the light is with you. Walk

walks in the darkness doesn&rsquo;t know where he is going. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-36 verse" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>While you have the light,
believe in the light, that you may become children of light.
Jesus said these things, and he departed and hid himself from them.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-37 verse" verse="37">&#xF646;&#xF64A;</SPAN>But though he had done

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-39 verse" verse="39">&#xF646;&#xF64C;</SPAN>For this cause they

their eyes and he hardened their heart,

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c12">12</SPAN><SPAN class="v12-41 verse" verse="41">&#xF647;&#xF644;</SPAN>Isaiah said these

<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF6DC;&#xF63B;</SPAN>Now before the feast
of the Passover, Jesus, knowing that his time had come that he would
depart from this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the
world, he loved them to the end. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>During supper, the devil having
already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon&rsquo;s son, to betray
him, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>Jesus, knowing that
the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he came forth
from God, and was going to God, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>arose from supper, and laid aside
his outer garments. He took a towel, and wrapped a towel around his waist.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>Then he poured water into
the basin, and began to wash the disciples feet, and to wipe them with
the towel that was wrapped around him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>Then he came to Simon Peter. He
said to him, Lord, do you wash my feet?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>Jesus answered him,
You don&rsquo;t know what I am doing now, but you will
understand later.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>Peter said to him,
You will never wash my feet!
<p>Jesus answered him, If I don&rsquo;t wash you, you have
no part with me.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>Simon Peter said to
him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>Jesus said to him,
Someone who has bathed only needs to have his feet
washed, but is completely clean. You are clean, but not all of
you. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>For he
knew him who would betray him, therefore he said, You
are not all clean. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>So when he had washed their
feet, put his outer garment back on, and sat down again, he said to them,
Do you know what I have done to you? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>You call me, Teacher and
Lord. You say so correctly, for so I am. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>If I then, the Lord and the
Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another&rsquo;s
feet. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>For I have given
you an example, that you also should do as I have done to you. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>Most certainly I tell you, a
servant is not greater than his lord, neither one who is sent greater than
he who sent him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>If you
know these things, blessed are you if you do them. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>I don&rsquo;t speak concerning all
of you. I know whom I have chosen. But that the Scripture may be
fulfilled, He who eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against
me.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>From now on, I tell you
before it happens, that when it happens, you may believe that I am he.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>Most certainly I tell
you, he who receives whomever I send, receives me, and he who receives me,
receives him who sent me.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>When Jesus had said
this, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, Most
certainly I tell you that one of you will betray me.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>The disciples looked
at one another, perplexed about whom he spoke. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>One of his disciples, whom Jesus
loved, was at the table, leaning against Jesus breast. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>Simon Peter therefore beckoned
to him, and said to him, Tell us who it is of whom he speaks.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>He, leaning back, as
he was, on Jesus breast, asked him, Lord, who is it?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>Jesus therefore
answered, It is he to whom I will give this piece of
bread when I have dipped it. So when he had dipped the piece of
bread, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>After the piece of bread, then
Satan entered into him.
<p>Then Jesus said to him, What you do, do
quickly.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Now no man at the
table knew why he said this to him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>For some thought, because Judas
had the money box, that Jesus said to him, Buy what things we need for
the feast, or that he should give something to the poor. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>Therefore having received that
morsel, he went out immediately. It was night.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>When he had gone out,
Jesus said, Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and
God has been glorified in him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>If God has been glorified in
him, God will also glorify him in himself, and he will glorify him
immediately. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>Little
children, I will be with you a little while longer. You will seek me, and
as I said to the Jews, Where I am going, you can&rsquo;t come, so now I

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-36 verse" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>Simon Peter said to
him, Lord, where are you going?

now, but you will follow afterwards.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-37 verse" verse="37">&#xF646;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Peter said to him,

<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c13">13</SPAN><SPAN class="v13-38 verse" verse="38">&#xF646;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Jesus answered him,

who sent me. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>If I had
not come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin, but now they
have no excuse for their sin. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>He who hates me, hates my Father
also. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>If I hadn&rsquo;t done
among them the works which no one else did, they wouldn&rsquo;t have had sin.
But now have they seen and also hated both me and my Father. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>But this happened so that the
word may be fulfilled which was written in their law, They hated me
without a cause.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>When the Counselor has come, whom I will send to you from the
Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will testify
about me. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c15">15</SPAN><SPAN class="v15-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>You will also
testify, because you have been with me from the beginning.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF6DC;&#xF63E;</SPAN>These things
have I spoken to you, so that you wouldn&rsquo;t be caused to stumble. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>They will put you out of the
synagogues. Yes, the time comes that whoever kills you will think that he
offers service to God. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>They will do these things because
they have not known the Father, nor me. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>But I have told you these things,
so that when the time comes, you may remember that I told you about them.
I didn&rsquo;t tell you these things from the beginning, because I was with
you. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>But now I am going
to him who sent me, and none of you asks me, Where are you going?
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>But because I have told
you these things, sorrow has filled your heart. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>Nevertheless I tell you the
truth: It is to your advantage that I go away, for if I don&rsquo;t go away,
the Counselor won&rsquo;t come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>When he has come, he will
convict the world about sin, about righteousness, and about judgment,
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>about sin, because they
don&rsquo;t believe in me, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>about righteousness, because I
am going to my Father, and you won&rsquo;t see me any more, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>about judgment, because the
prince of this world has been judged.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>I have yet many things to
tell you, but you can&rsquo;t bear them now. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>However when he, the Spirit of
truth, has come, he will guide you into all truth, for he will not speak
from himself, but whatever he hears, he will speak. He will declare to you
things that are coming. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>He will glorify me, for he will
take from what is mine, and will declare it to you. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>All things whatever the Father
has are mine, therefore I said that he takes of mine,
and will declare it to you. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>A little while, and you will not
see me. Again a little while, and you will see me.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Some of his disciples
therefore said to one another, What is this that he says to us, A little while, and you won&rsquo;t see me, and again a little
while, and you will see me, and, Because I go
to the Father? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>They said therefore, What is
this that he says, A little while? We don&rsquo;t
know what he is saying.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Therefore Jesus
perceived that they wanted to ask him, and he said to them, Do you inquire among yourselves concerning this, that I said,
A little while, and you won&rsquo;t see me, and again a little while, and
you will see me? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>Most
certainly I tell you, that you will weep and lament, but the world will
rejoice. You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>A woman, when she gives
birth, has sorrow, because her time has come. But when she has delivered
the child, she doesn&rsquo;t remember the anguish any more, for the joy that a
human being is born into the world. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>Therefore you now have sorrow,
but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will
take your joy away from you.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>In that day you will ask me
no questions. Most certainly I tell you, whatever you may ask of the
Father in my name, he will give it to you. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>Until now, you have asked
nothing in my name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be made
full. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>I have spoken
these things to you in figures of speech. But the time is coming when I
will no more speak to you in figures of speech, but will tell you plainly
about the Father. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>In
that day you will ask in my name, and I don&rsquo;t say to you, that I will
pray to the Father for you, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>for the Father himself loves
you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came forth from
God. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>I came out from the
Father, and have come into the world. Again, I leave the world, and go to
the Father.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>His disciples said to
him, Behold, now you speak plainly, and speak no figures of speech.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>Now we know that you
know all things, and don&rsquo;t need for anyone to question you. By this we
believe that you came forth from God.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>Jesus answered them,
Do you now believe? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>Behold, the time is coming, yes,
and has now come, that you will be scattered, everyone to his own place,

with me. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c16">16</SPAN><SPAN class="v16-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>I have told you
these things, that in me you may have peace. In the world you have
oppression, but cheer up! I have overcome the world.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF6DC;&#xF63F;</SPAN>Jesus said these
things, and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said, Father, the time has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son
may also glorify you, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>even as you gave him authority
over all flesh, he will give eternal life to all whom you have given him.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>This is eternal life,
that they should know you, the only true God, and him whom you sent, Jesus
Christ. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>I glorified you
on the earth. I have accomplished the work which you have given me to do.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>Now, Father, glorify me
with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world
existed. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>I revealed your

yours, and you have given them to me. They have kept your word. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>Now they have known that all

given me I have given to them, and they received them, and knew for sure
that I came forth from you, and they have believed that you sent me.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c17">17</SPAN><SPAN class="v17-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>I pray for them. I

<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF6DC;&#xF640;</SPAN>When Jesus had spoken
these words, he went out with his disciples over the brook Kidron, where
there was a garden, into which he and his disciples entered. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>Now Judas, who betrayed him, also
knew the place, for Jesus often met there with his disciples. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>Judas then, having taken a
detachment of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and the
Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>Jesus therefore, knowing all the
things that were happening to him, went forth, and said to them, Who are you looking for?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>They answered him,
Jesus of Nazareth.
<p>Jesus said to them, I am he.
<p>Judas also, who betrayed him, was standing with them. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>When therefore he said to them,
I am he, they went backward, and fell to the
ground.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>Again therefore he
asked them, Who are you looking for?
<p>They said, Jesus of Nazareth.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>Jesus answered, I told you that I am he. If therefore you seek me, let these
go their way, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>that the word might be fulfilled
which he spoke, Of those whom you have given me, I have
lost none.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>Simon Peter
therefore, having a sword, drew it, and struck the high priest&rsquo;s
servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant&rsquo;s name was Malchus.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>Jesus therefore said to
Peter, Put the sword into its sheath. The cup which the
Father has given me, shall I not surely drink it?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>So the detachment,
the commanding officer, and the officers of the Jews, seized Jesus and
bound him, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>and led him
to Annas first, for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was high priest
that year. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>Now it was
Caiaphas who advised the Jews that it was expedient that one man should
perish for the people. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>Simon Peter followed Jesus, as
did another disciple. Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and
entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>but Peter was standing at the
door outside. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest,
went out and spoke to her who kept the door, and brought in Peter. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Then the maid who kept the door
said to Peter, Are you also one of this man&rsquo;s disciples?
<p>He said, I am not.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Now the servants and
the officers were standing there, having made a fire of coals, for it was
cold. They were warming themselves. Peter was with them, standing and
warming himself. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>The
high priest therefore asked Jesus about his disciples, and about his
teaching. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>Jesus answered
him, I spoke openly to the world. I always taught in
synagogues, and in the temple, where the Jews always meet. I said nothing
in secret. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>Why do you
ask me? Ask those who have heard me what I said to them. Behold, these
know the things which I said.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>When he had said
this, one of the officers standing by slapped Jesus with his hand, saying,
Do you answer the high priest like that?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>Jesus answered him,
If I have spoken evil, testify of the evil, but if
well, why do you beat me?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>Annas sent him bound
to Caiaphas, the high priest. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>Now Simon Peter was standing and
warming himself. They said therefore to him, You aren&rsquo;t also one of
his disciples, are you?
<p>He denied it, and said, I am not.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>One of the servants
of the high priest, being a relative of him whose ear Peter had cut off,
said, Didn&rsquo;t I see you in the garden with him?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Peter therefore
denied it again, and immediately the rooster crowed.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>They led Jesus
therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium. It was early, and they
themselves didn&rsquo;t enter into the Praetorium, that they might not be
defiled, but might eat the Passover. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Pilate therefore went out to
them, and said, What accusation do you bring against this man?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>They answered him,
If this man weren&rsquo;t an evildoer, we wouldn&rsquo;t have delivered him up
to you.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>Pilate therefore said
to them, Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law.
<p>Therefore the Jews said to him, It is not lawful for us to put
anyone to death, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>that
the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying by what
kind of death he should die.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>Pilate therefore
entered again into the Praetorium, called Jesus, and said to him, Are
you the King of the Jews?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-34 verse" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>Jesus answered him,
Do you say this by yourself, or did others tell you
about me?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-35 verse" verse="35">&#xF646;&#xF648;</SPAN>Pilate answered,
I&rsquo;m not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests delivered
you to me. What have you done?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-36 verse" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>Jesus answered, My Kingdom is not of this world. If my Kingdom were of this
world, then my servants would fight, that I wouldn&rsquo;t be delivered to the
Jews. But now my Kingdom is not from here.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-37 verse" verse="37">&#xF646;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Pilate therefore said
to him, Are you a king then?
<p>Jesus answered, You say that I am a king. For this
reason I have been born, and for this reason I have come into the world,
that I should testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens
to my voice.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-38 verse" verse="38">&#xF646;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Pilate said to him,
What is truth?
<p>When he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and said to them,
I find no basis for a charge against him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-39 verse" verse="39">&#xF646;&#xF64C;</SPAN>But you have a custom, that I
should release someone to you at the Passover. Therefore do you want me to
release to you the King of the Jews?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c18">18</SPAN><SPAN class="v18-40 verse" verse="40">&#xF647;&#xF643;</SPAN>Then they all shouted
again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas! Now Barabbas was a robber.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF6DC;&#xF641;</SPAN>So Pilate then took
Jesus, and flogged him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>The soldiers twisted thorns into
a crown, and put it on his head, and dressed him in a purple garment.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>They kept saying,
Hail, King of the Jews! and they kept slapping him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>Then Pilate went out
again, and said to them, Behold, I bring him out to you, that you may
know that I find no basis for a charge against him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>Jesus therefore came
out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. Pilate said to
them, Behold, the man!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>When therefore the
chief priests and the officers saw him, they shouted, saying, Crucify!
Crucify!
<p>Pilate said to them, Take him yourselves, and crucify him, for I
find no basis for a charge against him.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>The Jews answered him,
We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself
the Son of God.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>When therefore Pilate
heard this saying, he was more afraid. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>He entered into the Praetorium
again, and said to Jesus, Where are you from? But Jesus gave him no
answer. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>Pilate therefore
said to him, Aren&rsquo;t you speaking to me? Don&rsquo;t you know that I have
power to release you, and have power to crucify you?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>Jesus answered, You would have no power at all against me, unless it were
given to you from above. Therefore he who delivered me to you has greater
sin.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>At this, Pilate was
seeking to release him, but the Jews cried out, saying, If you release
this man, you aren&rsquo;t Caesar&rsquo;s friend! Everyone who makes himself a
king speaks against Caesar!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>When Pilate therefore
heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment seat
at a place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>Now it was the
Preparation Day of the Passover, at about the sixth
hour. He said to the Jews, Behold, your King!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>They cried out,
Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!
<p>Pilate said to them, Shall I crucify your King?
<p>The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>So then he delivered
him to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus and led him away. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>He went out, bearing his cross,
to the place called The Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew,
Golgotha, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>where
they crucified him, and with him two others, on either side one, and Jesus
in the middle. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Pilate
wrote a title also, and put it on the cross. There was written, JESUS
OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>Therefore many of the Jews read
this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and
it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>The chief priests of the Jews
therefore said to Pilate, Don&rsquo;t write, The King of the Jews,
but, he said, I am King of the Jews.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>Pilate answered,
What I have written, I have written.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>Then the soldiers,
when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to
every soldier a part, and also the coat. Now the coat was without seam,
woven from the top throughout. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>Then they said to one another,
Let&rsquo;s not tear it, but cast lots for it to decide whose it will
be, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which says,
<dl>
<dt>They parted my garments among them.
<dd>For my cloak they cast lots.
</dl>
<p>Therefore the soldiers did these things. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>But there were standing by the
cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother&rsquo;s sister, Mary the wife of
Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>Therefore when Jesus saw his
mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he said to his
mother, Woman, behold your son! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Then he said to the disciple,
Behold, your mother! From that hour, the
disciple took her to his own home.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>After this, Jesus, seeing that all things were now finished, that the
Scripture might be fulfilled, said, I am
thirsty. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Now a
vessel full of vinegar was set there, so they put a sponge full of the
vinegar on hyssop, and held it at his mouth. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>When Jesus therefore had
received the vinegar, he said, It is
finished. He bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>Therefore the Jews,
because it was the Preparation Day, so that the bodies wouldn&rsquo;t remain
on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a special one), asked of
Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-32 verse" verse="32">&#xF646;&#xF645;</SPAN>Therefore the soldiers
came, and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified
with him, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-33 verse" verse="33">&#xF646;&#xF646;</SPAN>but when they
came to Jesus, and saw that he was already dead, they didn&rsquo;t break his
legs. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-34 verse" verse="34">&#xF646;&#xF647;</SPAN>However one of the
soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water
came out. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-35 verse" verse="35">&#xF646;&#xF648;</SPAN>He who has
seen has testified, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the
truth, that you may believe. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-36 verse" verse="36">&#xF646;&#xF649;</SPAN>For these things happened, that
the Scripture might be fulfilled, A bone of him will not be
broken. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-37 verse" verse="37">&#xF646;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Again another Scripture says,
They will look on him whom they pierced.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-38 verse" verse="38">&#xF646;&#xF64B;</SPAN>After these things,
Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of
the Jews, asked of Pilate that he might take away Jesus body. Pilate
gave him permission. He came therefore and took away his body. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-39 verse" verse="39">&#xF646;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Nicodemus, who at first came to
Jesus by night, also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred Roman pounds. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-40 verse" verse="40">&#xF647;&#xF643;</SPAN>So they took Jesus body, and
bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to
bury. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-41 verse" verse="41">&#xF647;&#xF644;</SPAN>Now in the place
where he was crucified there was a garden. In the garden was a new tomb in
which no man had ever yet been laid. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c19">19</SPAN><SPAN class="v19-42 verse" verse="42">&#xF647;&#xF645;</SPAN>Then because of the Jews
Preparation Day (for the tomb was near at hand) they laid Jesus there.</div><div class="section J"><h2>Section J</h2>
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF63A;&#xF639;</SPAN>Now on the first day
of the week, Mary Magdalene went early, while it was still dark, to the
tomb, and saw the stone taken away from the tomb. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>Therefore she ran and came to
Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them,
They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we don&rsquo;t know
where they have laid him!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>Therefore Peter and
the other disciple went out, and they went toward the tomb. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>They both ran together. The other
disciple outran Peter, and came to the tomb first. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>Stooping and looking in, he saw
the linen cloths lying, yet he didn&rsquo;t enter in. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>Then Simon Peter came, following
him, and entered into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>and the cloth that had been on
his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by
itself. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>So then the other
disciple who came first to the tomb also entered in, and he saw and
believed. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>For as yet they
didn&rsquo;t know the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>So the disciples went away again
to their own homes.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>But Mary was standing
outside at the tomb weeping. So, as she wept, she stooped and looked into
the tomb, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>and she saw
two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where
the body of Jesus had lain. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>They told her, Woman, why are
you weeping?
<p>She said to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I
don&rsquo;t know where they have laid him. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>When she had said this, she
turned around and saw Jesus standing, and didn&rsquo;t know that it was Jesus.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>Jesus said to her,
Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking
for?
<p>She, supposing him to be the gardener, said to him, Sir, if you have
carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him
away.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>Jesus said to her,
Mary.
<p>She turned and said to him, Rabboni! which is
to say, Teacher!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Jesus said to her,
Don&rsquo;t hold me, for I haven&rsquo;t yet ascended to my
Father, but go to my brothers, and tell them, I am ascending to my
Father and your Father, to my God and your God.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Mary Magdalene came
and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had said
these things to her. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>When therefore it was evening,
on that day, the first day of the week, and when the doors were locked
where the disciples were assembled, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and
stood in the midst, and said to them, Peace be to
you.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>When he had said
this, he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were
glad when they saw the Lord. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>Jesus therefore said to them
again, Peace be to you. As the Father has sent me, even
so I send you. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>When he had said this, he
breathed on them, and said to them, Receive the Holy
Spirit! <SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>If you forgive
anyone&rsquo;s sins, they have been forgiven them. If you retain anyone&rsquo;s
sins, they have been retained.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>But Thomas, one of
the twelve, called Didymus, wasn&rsquo;t with them when Jesus came. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>The other disciples therefore
said to him, We have seen the Lord!
<p>But he said to them, Unless I see in his hands the print of the
nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-26 verse" verse="26">&#xF645;&#xF649;</SPAN>After eight days
again his disciples were inside, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, the
doors being locked, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be to you. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-27 verse" verse="27">&#xF645;&#xF64A;</SPAN>Then he said to Thomas, Reach here your finger, and see my hands. Reach here your
hand, and put it into my side. Don&rsquo;t be unbelieving, but
believing.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-28 verse" verse="28">&#xF645;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Thomas answered him,
My Lord and my God!
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-29 verse" verse="29">&#xF645;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Jesus said to him,
Because you have seen me, you have believed. Blessed
are those who have not seen, and have believed.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-30 verse" verse="30">&#xF646;&#xF643;</SPAN>Therefore Jesus did
many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written
in this book, <SPAN class="tab-chapter c20">20</SPAN><SPAN class="v20-31 verse" verse="31">&#xF646;&#xF644;</SPAN>but these
are written, that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of
God, and that believing you may have life in his name.
<p><SPAN class="chapter">&#xF63A;&#xF6DC;</SPAN>After these things,
Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias. He
revealed himself this way. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-2 verse" verse="2">&#xF645;</SPAN>Simon Peter, Thomas called
Didymus, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two
others of his disciples were together. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-3 verse" verse="3">&#xF646;</SPAN>Simon Peter said to them,
I&rsquo;m going fishing.
<p>They told him, We are also coming with you. They immediately went
out, and entered into the boat. That night, they caught nothing. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-4 verse" verse="4">&#xF647;</SPAN>But when day had already come,
Jesus stood on the beach, yet the disciples didn&rsquo;t know that it was
Jesus. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-5 verse" verse="5">&#xF648;</SPAN>Jesus therefore
said to them, Children, have you anything to
eat?
<p>They answered him, No.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-6 verse" verse="6">&#xF649;</SPAN>He said to them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find
some.
<p>They cast it therefore, and now they weren&rsquo;t able to draw it in for
the multitude of fish. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-7 verse" verse="7">&#xF64A;</SPAN>That disciple therefore whom
Jesus loved said to Peter, It&rsquo;s the Lord!
<p>So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he wrapped his coat
around him (for he was naked), and threw himself into the sea. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-8 verse" verse="8">&#xF64B;</SPAN>But the other disciples came in
the little boat (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits away), dragging the net full of fish.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-9 verse" verse="9">&#xF64C;</SPAN>So when they got out on
the land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-10 verse" verse="10">&#xF644;&#xF643;</SPAN>Jesus said to them,
Bring some of the fish which you have just
caught.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-11 verse" verse="11">&#xF644;&#xF644;</SPAN>Simon Peter went up,
and drew the net to land, full of great fish, one hundred fifty-three, and
even though there were so many, the net wasn&rsquo;t torn.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-12 verse" verse="12">&#xF644;&#xF645;</SPAN>Jesus said to them,
Come and eat breakfast.
<p>None of the disciples dared inquire of him, Who are you? knowing
that it was the Lord.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-13 verse" verse="13">&#xF644;&#xF646;</SPAN>Then Jesus came and
took the bread, gave it to them, and the fish likewise. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-14 verse" verse="14">&#xF644;&#xF647;</SPAN>This is now the third time that
Jesus was revealed to his disciples, after he had risen from the dead.
<SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-15 verse" verse="15">&#xF644;&#xF648;</SPAN>So when they had eaten
their breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son
of Jonah, do you love me more than these?
<p>He said to him, Yes, Lord, you know that I have affection for you.
<p>He said to him, Feed my lambs. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-16 verse" verse="16">&#xF644;&#xF649;</SPAN>He said to him again a second
time, Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me?
<p>He said to him, Yes, Lord, you know that I have affection for you.
<p>He said to him, Tend my sheep. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-17 verse" verse="17">&#xF644;&#xF64A;</SPAN>He said to him the third time,
Simon, son of Jonah, do you have affection for
me?
<p>Peter was grieved because he asked him the third time, Do you have affection for me? He said to him,
Lord, you know everything. You know that I have affection for you.
<p>Jesus said to him, Feed my sheep. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-18 verse" verse="18">&#xF644;&#xF64B;</SPAN>Most certainly I tell you, when
you were young, you dressed yourself, and walked where you wanted to. But
when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress
you, and carry you where you don&rsquo;t want to go.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-19 verse" verse="19">&#xF644;&#xF64C;</SPAN>Now he said this,
signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God. When he had said
this, he said to him, Follow me.
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-20 verse" verse="20">&#xF645;&#xF643;</SPAN>Then Peter, turning
around, saw a disciple following. This was the disciple whom Jesus
sincerely loved, the one who had also leaned on Jesus breast at the
supper and asked, Lord, who is going to betray You? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-21 verse" verse="21">&#xF645;&#xF644;</SPAN>Peter seeing him, said to Jesus,
Lord, what about this man?
<p><SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-22 verse" verse="22">&#xF645;&#xF645;</SPAN>Jesus said to him,
If I desire that he stay until I come, what is that to
you? You follow me. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-23 verse" verse="23">&#xF645;&#xF646;</SPAN>This saying therefore went out
among the brothers, that this disciple wouldn&rsquo;t die.
Yet Jesus didn&rsquo;t say to him that he wouldn&rsquo;t die, but, If I desire that he stay until I come, what is that to
you? <SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-24 verse" verse="24">&#xF645;&#xF647;</SPAN>This is
the disciple who testifies about these things, and wrote these things. We
know that his witness is true. <SPAN class="tab-chapter c21">21</SPAN><SPAN class="v21-25 verse" verse="25">&#xF645;&#xF648;</SPAN>There are also many other things
which Jesus did, which if they would all be written, I suppose that even
the world itself wouldn&rsquo;t have room for the books that would be written.
