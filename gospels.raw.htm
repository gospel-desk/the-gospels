The Good News According to Mark
</h1><p>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,1);</script>The beginning of the Good
News of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,2);</script>As it is written in the prophets,
<dl>
<dt>“Behold, I send my messenger before your face,
<dd>who will prepare your way before you.<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N1">*</a></sup></font>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,3);</script>The voice of one
crying in the wilderness,
<dd>‘Make ready the way of the Lord!
<dd>Make his paths straight!’”<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N2">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,4);</script>John came <a
href="#N3">baptizing</a> in the wilderness and preaching the baptism of
repentance for forgiveness of sins. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,5);</script>All the country of Judea and all
those of Jerusalem went out to him. They were baptized by him in the
Jordan river, confessing their sins. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,6);</script>John was clothed with camel’s
hair and a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,7);</script>He preached, saying,
“After me comes he who is mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals I
am not worthy to stoop down and loosen. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,8);</script>I baptized you <a
href="#N4">in</a> water, but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,9);</script>It happened in those
days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John
in the Jordan. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,10);</script>Immediately coming up from the
water, he saw the heavens parting, and the Spirit descending on him like a
dove. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,11);</script>A voice came out of
the sky, “You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,12);</script>Immediately the Spirit
drove him out into the wilderness. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,13);</script>He was there in the wilderness
forty days tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals; and the angels
were serving him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,14);</script>Now after John was
taken into custody, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the Good News of
the Kingdom of God, <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,15);</script>and
saying, <span class="j">“The time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God
is at hand! Repent, and believe in the Good News.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,16);</script>Passing along by the
sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net
into the sea, for they were fishermen. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,17);</script>Jesus said to them, <span
class="j">“Come after me, and I will make you into fishers for
men.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,18);</script>Immediately they left
their nets, and followed him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,19);</script>Going on a little further from
there, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother, who were
also in the boat mending the nets. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,20);</script>Immediately he called them, and
they left their father, Zebedee, in the boat with the hired servants, and
went after him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,21);</script>They went
into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath day he entered into the
synagogue and taught. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,22);</script>They were astonished at his
teaching, for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,23);</script>Immediately there was in
their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,24);</script>saying, “Ha! What do we have to
do with you, Jesus, you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know you
who you are: the Holy One of God!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,25);</script>Jesus rebuked him,
saying, <span class="j">“Be quiet, and come out of him!”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,26);</script>The unclean spirit,
convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,27);</script>They were all amazed, so that
they questioned among themselves, saying, “What is this? A new teaching?
For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey
him!” <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,28);</script>The report of him
went out immediately everywhere into all the region of Galilee and its
surrounding area.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,29);</script>Immediately, when they
had come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and
Andrew, with James and John. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,30);</script>Now Simon’s wife’s mother lay
sick with a fever, and immediately they told him about her. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,31);</script>He came and took her by the hand,
and raised her up. The fever left her, and she served them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,32);</script>At evening, when the sun had set,
they brought to him all who were sick, and those who were possessed by
demons. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,33);</script>All the city was
gathered together at the door. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,34);</script>He healed many who were sick with
various diseases, and cast out many demons. He didn’t allow the demons
to speak, because they knew him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,35);</script>Early in the morning,
while it was still dark, he rose up and went out, and departed into a
deserted place, and prayed there. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,36);</script>Simon and those who were with him
followed after him; <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,37);</script>and
they found him, and told him, “Everyone is looking for you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,38);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Let’s go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach
there also, because I came out for this reason.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,39);</script>He went into their synagogues
throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,40);</script>A leper came to him,
begging him, kneeling down to him, and saying to him, “If you want to,
you can make me clean.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,41);</script>Being moved with
compassion, he stretched out his hand, and touched him, and said to him,
<span class="j">“I want to. Be made clean.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,42);</script>When he had said this,
immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,43);</script>He strictly warned him, and
immediately sent him out, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,44);</script>and said to him, <span
class="j">“See you say nothing to anybody, but go show yourself to the
priest, and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for
a testimony to them.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,45);</script>But he went out, and
began to proclaim it much, and to spread about the matter, so that Jesus
could no more openly enter into a city, but was outside in desert places:
and they came to him from everywhere.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,1);</script>When he entered again
into Capernaum after some days, it was heard that he was in the house.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,2);</script>Immediately many were
gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even around the
door; and he spoke the word to them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,3);</script>Four people came, carrying a
paralytic to him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,4);</script>When
they could not come near to him for the crowd, they removed the roof where
he was. When they had broken it up, they let down the mat that the
paralytic was lying on. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,5);</script>Jesus, seeing their faith, said to
the paralytic, <span class="j">“Son, your sins are forgiven
you.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,6);</script>But there were some of
the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,7);</script>“Why does this man speak
blasphemies like that? Who can forgive sins but God alone?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,8);</script>Immediately Jesus,
perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, said to
them, <span class="j">“Why do you reason these things in your hearts?
<script type="text/javascript">cj(2,9);</script>Which is easier, to tell
the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven;’ or to say, ‘Arise, and take
up your bed, and walk?’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(2,10);</script>But that you may know that the
Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”</span>—he said to
the paralytic—<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,11);</script><span
class="j">“I tell you, arise, take up your mat, and go to your
house.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,12);</script>He arose, and
immediately took up the mat, and went out in front of them all; so that
they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, “We never saw anything
like this!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,13);</script>He went out again by
the seaside. All the multitude came to him, and he taught them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,14);</script>As he passed by, he saw Levi, the
son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, <span
class="j">“Follow me.”</span> And he arose and followed him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,15);</script>It happened, that he
was reclining at the table in his house, and many tax collectors and
sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many, and
they followed him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,16);</script>The
scribes and the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with the
sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, “Why is it that he
eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,17);</script>When Jesus heard it,
he said to them, <span class="j">“Those who are healthy have no need for
a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but
sinners to repentance.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,18);</script>John’s disciples and
the Pharisees were fasting, and they came and asked him, “Why do
John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your
disciples don’t fast?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,19);</script>Jesus said to them,
<span class="j">“Can the groomsmen fast while the bridegroom is with
them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they can’t fast.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(2,20);</script>But the days will come
when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then will they fast
in that day. <script type="text/javascript">cj(2,21);</script>No one sews
a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, or else the patch shrinks and
the new tears away from the old, and a worse hole is made. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(2,22);</script>No one puts new wine into old
wineskins, or else the new wine will burst the skins, and the wine pours
out, and the skins will be destroyed; but they put new wine into fresh
wineskins.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,23);</script>It happened that he
was going on the Sabbath day through the grain fields, and his disciples
began, as they went, to pluck the ears of grain. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,24);</script>The Pharisees said to him,
“Behold, why do they do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath day?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,25);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Did you never read what David did, when he had need, and was
hungry—he, and those who were with him? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(2,26);</script>How he entered into God’s house
when Abiathar was high priest, and ate the show bread, which is not lawful
to eat except for the priests, and gave also to those who were with
him?”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,27);</script>He said to
them, <span class="j">“The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the
Sabbath. <script type="text/javascript">cj(2,28);</script>Therefore the
Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,1);</script>He entered again into
the synagogue, and there was a man there who had his hand withered.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,2);</script>They watched him, whether
he would heal him on the Sabbath day, that they might accuse him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,3);</script>He said to the man who had his
hand withered, <span class="j">“Stand up.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,4);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Is it lawful on the Sabbath day to do good, or to do harm? To
save a life, or to kill?”</span> But they were silent. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,5);</script>When he had looked around at them
with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their hearts, he said to the
man, <span class="j">“Stretch out your hand.”</span> He stretched it
out, and his hand was restored as healthy as the other. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,6);</script>The Pharisees went out, and
immediately conspired with the Herodians against him, how they might
destroy him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,7);</script>Jesus withdrew to the
sea with his disciples, and a great multitude followed him from Galilee,
from Judea, <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,8);</script>from
Jerusalem, from Idumaea, beyond the Jordan, and those from around Tyre and
Sidon. A great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came to him.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,9);</script>He spoke to his disciples
that a little boat should stay near him because of the crowd, so that they
wouldn’t press on him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,10);</script>For he had healed many, so that
as many as had diseases pressed on him that they might touch him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,11);</script>The unclean spirits, whenever
they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, “You are the Son of
God!” <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,12);</script>He sternly warned
them that they should not make him known.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,13);</script>He went up into the
mountain, and called to himself those whom he wanted, and they went to
him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,14);</script>He appointed twelve,
that they might be with him, and that he might send them out to preach,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,15);</script>and to have authority to
heal sicknesses and to cast out demons: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,16);</script>Simon, to whom he gave the name
Peter; <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,17);</script>James the son of
Zebedee; John, the brother of James, and he surnamed them Boanerges, which
means, Sons of Thunder; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,18);</script>Andrew; Philip; Bartholomew;
Matthew; Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,19);</script>and Judas Iscariot, who
also betrayed him.
<p>He came into a house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,20);</script>The multitude came together
again, so that they could not so much as eat bread. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,21);</script>When his friends heard it, they
went out to seize him: for they said, “He is insane.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,22);</script>The scribes who came down from
Jerusalem said, “He has Beelzebul,” and, “By the prince of the
demons he casts out the demons.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,23);</script>He summoned them, and
said to them in parables, <span class="j">“How can Satan cast out Satan?
<script type="text/javascript">cj(3,24);</script>If a kingdom is divided
against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(3,25);</script>If a house is divided against
itself, that house cannot stand. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(3,26);</script>If Satan has risen up against
himself, and is divided, he can’t stand, but has an end. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(3,27);</script>But no one can enter into the
house of the strong man to plunder, unless he first binds the strong man;
and then he will plunder his house. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(3,28);</script>Most certainly I tell you, all
sins of the descendants of man will be forgiven, including their
blasphemies with which they may blaspheme; <script
type="text/javascript">cj(3,29);</script>but whoever may blaspheme against
the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal
sin”</span><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,30);</script>—because
they said, “He has an unclean spirit.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,31);</script>His mother and his
brothers came, and standing outside, they sent to him, calling him.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,32);</script>A multitude was sitting
around him, and they told him, “Behold, your mother, your brothers, and
<a href="#N5">your sisters</a> are outside looking for you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,33);</script>He answered them,
<span class="j">“Who are my mother and my brothers?”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,34);</script>Looking around at those who sat
around him, he said, <span class="j">“Behold, my mother and my brothers!
<script type="text/javascript">cj(3,35);</script>For whoever does the will
of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,1);</script>Again he began to teach
by the seaside. A great multitude was gathered to him, so that he entered
into a boat in the sea, and sat down. All the multitude were on the land
by the sea. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,2);</script>He taught them
many things in parables, and told them in his teaching, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,3);</script><span class="j">“Listen! Behold,
the farmer went out to sow, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(4,4);</script>and it happened, as he sowed, some
seed fell by the road, and the birds<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N6">*</a></sup></font> came and devoured it. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(4,5);</script>Others fell on the rocky ground,
where it had little soil, and immediately it sprang up, because it had no
depth of soil. <script type="text/javascript">cj(4,6);</script>When the
sun had risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered
away. <script type="text/javascript">cj(4,7);</script>Others fell among
the thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no
fruit. <script type="text/javascript">cj(4,8);</script>Others fell into
the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing. Some
brought forth thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times
as much.”</span><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,9);</script>He said,
<span class="j">“Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,10);</script>When he was alone,
those who were around him with the twelve asked him about the parables.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,11);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“To you is given the mystery of the Kingdom of God, but to
those who are outside, all things are done in parables, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(4,12);</script>that ‘seeing they may see, and
not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest perhaps
they should turn again, and their sins should be forgiven
them.’”</span><font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N7">*</a></sup></font>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,13);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Don’t you understand this parable? How will you understand
all of the parables? <script type="text/javascript">cj(4,14);</script>The
farmer sows the word. <script type="text/javascript">cj(4,15);</script>The
ones by the road are the ones where the word is sown; and when they have
heard, immediately Satan comes, and takes away the word which has been
sown in them. <script type="text/javascript">cj(4,16);</script>These in
the same way are those who are sown on the rocky places, who, when they
have heard the word, immediately receive it with joy. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(4,17);</script>They have no root in themselves,
but are short-lived. When oppression or persecution arises because of the
word, immediately they stumble. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(4,18);</script>Others are those who are sown
among the thorns. These are those who have heard the word, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(4,19);</script>and the cares of this age, and
the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in
choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(4,20);</script>Those which were sown on the good
ground are those who hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, some
thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,21);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Is the lamp brought to be put under a <a
href="#N8">basket</a> or under a bed? Isn’t it put on a stand? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(4,22);</script>For there is nothing hidden,
except that it should be made known; neither was anything made secret, but
that it should come to light. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(4,23);</script>If any man has ears to hear, let
him hear.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,24);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Take heed what you hear. With whatever measure you measure,
it will be measured to you, and more will be given to you who hear.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(4,25);</script>For whoever has, to him
will more be given, and he who doesn’t have, even that which he has will
be taken away from him.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,26);</script>He said, <span
class="j">“The Kingdom of God is as if a man should cast seed on the
earth, <script type="text/javascript">cj(4,27);</script>and should sleep
and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he
doesn’t know how. <script type="text/javascript">cj(4,28);</script>For
the earth bears fruit: first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain
in the ear. <script type="text/javascript">cj(4,29);</script>But when the
fruit is ripe, immediately he puts forth the sickle, because the harvest
has come.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,30);</script>He said, <span
class="j">“How will we liken the Kingdom of God? Or with what parable
will we illustrate it? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(4,31);</script>It’s like a grain of mustard
seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, though it is less than all the
seeds that are on the earth, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(4,32);</script>yet when it is sown, grows up,
and becomes greater than all the herbs, and puts out great branches, so
that the birds of the sky can lodge under its shadow.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,33);</script>With many such
parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,34);</script>Without a parable he didn’t
speak to them; but privately to his own disciples he explained everything.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,35);</script>On that day, when
evening had come, he said to them, <span class="j">“Let’s go over to
the other side.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,36);</script>Leaving the multitude, they took
him with them, even as he was, in the boat. Other small boats were also
with him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,37);</script>A big wind
storm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so much that the boat was
already filled. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,38);</script>He
himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion, and they woke him up, and
told him, “Teacher, don’t you care that we are dying?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,39);</script>He awoke, and rebuked
the wind, and said to the sea, <span class="j">“Peace! Be
still!”</span> The wind ceased, and there was a great calm. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,40);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Why are you so afraid? How is it that you have no
faith?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,41);</script>They were greatly
afraid, and said to one another, “Who then is this, that even the wind
and the sea obey him?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,1);</script>They came to the other
side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,2);</script>When he had come out of the boat,
immediately a man with an unclean spirit met him out of the tombs. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,3);</script>He lived in the tombs. Nobody
could bind him any more, not even with chains, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,4);</script>because he had been often bound
with fetters and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and
the fetters broken in pieces. Nobody had the strength to tame him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,5);</script>Always, night and day, in the
tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out, and cutting himself with
stones. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,6);</script>When he saw Jesus
from afar, he ran and bowed down to him, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,7);</script>and crying out with a loud voice,
he said, “What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High
God? I adjure you by God, don’t torment me.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,8);</script>For he said to him, <span
class="j">“Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,9);</script>He asked him, <span
class="j">“What is your name?”</span>
<p>He said to him, “My name is Legion, for we are many.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,10);</script>He begged him much that he would
not send them away out of the country. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,11);</script>Now on the mountainside there was
a great herd of pigs feeding. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,12);</script>All the demons begged him,
saying, “Send us into the pigs, that we may enter into them.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,13);</script>At once Jesus gave
them permission. The unclean spirits came out and entered into the pigs.
The herd of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea,
and they were drowned in the sea. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,14);</script>Those who fed them fled, and told
it in the city and in the country.
<p>The people came to see what it was that had happened. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,15);</script>They came to Jesus, and saw him
who had been possessed by demons sitting, clothed, and in his right mind,
even him who had the legion; and they were afraid. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,16);</script>Those who saw it declared to them
how it happened to him who was possessed by demons, and about the pigs.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(5,17);</script>They began to beg him to
depart from their region.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,18);</script>As he was entering
into the boat, he who had been possessed by demons begged him that he
might be with him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,19);</script>He
didn’t allow him, but said to him, <span class="j">“Go to your house,
to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for
you, and how he had mercy on you.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,20);</script>He went his way, and
began to proclaim in Decapolis how Jesus had done great things for him,
and everyone marveled.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,21);</script>When Jesus had crossed
back over in the boat to the other side, a great multitude was gathered to
him; and he was by the sea. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,22);</script>Behold, one of the rulers of the
synagogue, Jairus by name, came; and seeing him, he fell at his feet,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(5,23);</script>and begged him much,
saying, “My little daughter is at the point of death. Please come and
lay your hands on her, that she may be made healthy, and live.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,24);</script>He went with him, and
a great multitude followed him, and they pressed upon him on all sides.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(5,25);</script>A certain woman, who had
an issue of blood for twelve years, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,26);</script>and had suffered many things by
many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better, but
rather grew worse, <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,27);</script>having
heard the things concerning Jesus, came up behind him in the crowd, and
touched his clothes. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,28);</script>For
she said, “If I just touch his clothes, I will be made well.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,29);</script>Immediately the flow of her blood
was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her
affliction.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,30);</script>Immediately Jesus,
perceiving in himself that the power had gone out from him, turned around
in the crowd, and asked, <span class="j">“Who touched my
clothes?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,31);</script>His disciples said to
him, “You see the multitude pressing against you, and you say, ‘Who
touched me?’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,32);</script>He looked around to
see her who had done this thing. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,33);</script>But the woman, fearing and
trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before
him, and told him all the truth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,34);</script>He said to her, <span
class="j">“Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be
cured of your disease.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,35);</script>While he was still
speaking, people came from the synagogue ruler’s house saying, “Your
daughter is dead. Why bother the Teacher any more?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,36);</script>But Jesus, when he
heard the message spoken, immediately said to the ruler of the synagogue,
<span class="j">“Don’t be afraid, only believe.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,37);</script>He allowed no one to follow him,
except Peter, James, and John the brother of James. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,38);</script>He came to the synagogue
ruler’s house, and he saw an uproar, weeping, and great wailing. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,39);</script>When he had entered in, he said
to them, <span class="j">“Why do you make an uproar and weep? The child
is not dead, but is asleep.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,40);</script>They ridiculed him.
But he, having put them all out, took the father of the child, her mother,
and those who were with him, and went in where the child was lying.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(5,41);</script>Taking the child by the
hand, he said to her, <span class="j">“Talitha cumi!”</span> which
means, being interpreted, <span class="j">“Girl, I tell you, get
up!”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,42);</script>Immediately
the girl rose up and walked, for she was twelve years old. They were
amazed with great amazement. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,43);</script>He strictly ordered them that no
one should know this, and commanded that something should be given to her
to eat.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,1);</script>He went out from there.
He came into his own country, and his disciples followed him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,2);</script>When the Sabbath had come, he
began to teach in the synagogue, and many hearing him were astonished,
saying, “Where did this man get these things?” and, “What is the
wisdom that is given to this man, that such mighty works come about by his
hands? <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,3);</script>Isn’t this the
carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James, Joses, Judah, and Simon?
Aren’t his sisters here with us?” They were offended at him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,4);</script>Jesus said to them,
<span class="j">“A prophet is not without honor, except in his own
country, and among his own relatives, and in his own house.”</span>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(6,5);</script>He could do no mighty work
there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people, and healed
them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,6);</script>He marveled because
of their unbelief.
<p>He went around the villages teaching. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,7);</script>He called to himself the twelve,
and began to send them out two by two; and he gave them authority over the
unclean spirits. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,8);</script>He
commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, except a
staff only: no bread, no wallet, no money in their purse, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,9);</script>but to wear sandals, and not put
on two tunics. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,10);</script>He said to
them, <span class="j">“Wherever you enter into a house, stay there until
you depart from there. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,11);</script>Whoever will not receive you nor
hear you, as you depart from there, shake off the dust that is under your
feet for a testimony against them. Assuredly, I tell you, it will be more
tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that
city!”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,12);</script>They went out and
preached that people should repent. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,13);</script>They cast out many demons, and
anointed many with oil who were sick, and healed them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,14);</script>King Herod heard this, for his
name had become known, and he said, “John the Baptizer has risen from
the dead, and therefore these powers are at work in him.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,15);</script>But others said, “He is
Elijah.” Others said, “He is a prophet, or like one of the
prophets.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,16);</script>But Herod,
when he heard this, said, “This is John, whom I beheaded. He has risen
from the dead.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,17);</script>For
Herod himself had sent out and arrested John, and bound him in prison for
the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, for he had married her.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(6,18);</script>For John said to Herod,
“It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,19);</script>Herodias set herself against him,
and desired to kill him, but she couldn’t, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,20);</script>for Herod feared John, knowing
that he was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. When he heard
him, he did many things, and he heard him gladly.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,21);</script>Then a convenient day
came, that Herod on his birthday made a supper for his nobles, the high
officers, and the chief men of Galilee. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,22);</script>When the daughter of Herodias
herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod and those sitting with him.
The king said to the young lady, “Ask me whatever you want, and I will
give it to you.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,23);</script>He
swore to her, “Whatever you shall ask of me, I will give you, up to half
of my kingdom.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,24);</script>She went out, and said
to her mother, “What shall I ask?”
<p>She said, “The head of John the Baptizer.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,25);</script>She came in
immediately with haste to the king, and asked, “I want you to give me
right now the head of John the Baptizer on a platter.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,26);</script>The king was
exceedingly sorry, but for the sake of his oaths, and of his dinner
guests, he didn’t wish to refuse her. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,27);</script>Immediately the king sent out a
soldier of his guard, and commanded to bring John’s head, and he went
and beheaded him in the prison, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,28);</script>and brought his head on a
platter, and gave it to the young lady; and the young lady gave it to her
mother.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,29);</script>When his disciples
heard this, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,30);</script>The apostles gathered
themselves together to Jesus, and they told him all things, whatever they
had done, and whatever they had taught. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,31);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“You come apart into a deserted place, and rest
awhile.”</span> For there were many coming and going, and they had no
leisure so much as to eat. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,32);</script>They went away in the boat to a
deserted place by themselves. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,33);</script><a href="#N9">They</a> saw them
going, and many recognized him and ran there on foot from all the cities.
They arrived before them and came together to him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,34);</script>Jesus came out, saw a great
multitude, and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep
without a shepherd, and he began to teach them many things. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,35);</script>When it was late in the day, his
disciples came to him, and said, “This place is deserted, and it is late
in the day. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,36);</script>Send them
away, that they may go into the surrounding country and villages, and buy
themselves bread, for they have nothing to eat.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,37);</script>But he answered them,
<span class="j">“You give them something to eat.”</span>
<p>They asked him, “Shall we go and buy <a href="#N10">two hundred
denarii</a> worth of bread, and give them something to eat?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,38);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“How many loaves do you have? Go see.”</span>
<p>When they knew, they said, “Five, and two fish.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,39);</script>He commanded them that
everyone should sit down in groups on the green grass. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,40);</script>They sat down in ranks, by
hundreds and by fifties. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,41);</script>He took the five loaves and the
two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke the loaves, and
he gave to his disciples to set before them, and he divided the two fish
among them all. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,42);</script>They all
ate, and were filled. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,43);</script>They took up twelve baskets full
of broken pieces and also of the fish. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,44);</script>Those who ate the loaves
were<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N11">*</a></sup></font>
five thousand men.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,45);</script>Immediately he made
his disciples get into the boat, and to go ahead to the other side, to
Bethsaida, while he himself sent the multitude away. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,46);</script>After he had taken leave of them,
he went up the mountain to pray.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,47);</script>When evening had come,
the boat was in the midst of the sea, and he was alone on the land.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(6,48);</script>Seeing them distressed in
rowing, for the wind was contrary to them, about the fourth watch of the
night he came to them, walking on the sea,<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N12">*</a></sup></font> and he would have passed by
them, <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,49);</script>but they, when they
saw him walking on the sea, supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(6,50);</script>for they all saw him, and
were troubled. But he immediately spoke with them, and said to them, <span
class="j">“Cheer up! <a href="#N13">It is I!</a> Don’t be
afraid.”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,51);</script>He got
into the boat with them; and the wind ceased, and they were very amazed
among themselves, and marveled; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,52);</script>for they hadn’t understood
about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,53);</script>When they had crossed
over, they came to land at Gennesaret, and moored to the shore. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,54);</script>When they had come out of the
boat, immediately the people recognized him, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,55);</script>and ran around that whole region,
and began to bring those who were sick, on their mats, to where they heard
he was. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,56);</script>Wherever he
entered, into villages, or into cities, or into the country, they laid the
sick in the marketplaces, and begged him that they might touch just the <a
href="#N14">fringe</a> of his garment; and as many as touched him were
made well.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,1);</script>Then the Pharisees, and
some of the scribes gathered together to him, having come from Jerusalem.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,2);</script>Now when they saw some of
his disciples eating bread with defiled, that is, unwashed, hands, they
found fault. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,3);</script>(For the
Pharisees, and all the Jews, don’t eat unless they wash their hands and
forearms, holding to the tradition of the elders. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,4);</script>They don’t eat when they come
from the marketplace, unless they bathe themselves, and there are many
other things, which they have received to hold to: washings of cups,
pitchers, bronze vessels, and couches.) <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,5);</script>The Pharisees and the scribes
asked him, “Why don’t your disciples walk according to the tradition
of the elders, but eat their bread with unwashed hands?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,6);</script>He answered them, <span
class="j">“Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written,</span>
<dl><span class="j">
<dt>‘This people honors me with their lips,
<dd>but their heart is far from me.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cj(7,7);</script>But in vain do they
worship me,
<dd>teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N15">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(7,8);</script>“For you set aside the
commandment of God, and hold tightly to the tradition of men—the washing
of pitchers and cups, and you do many other such things.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,9);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Full well do you reject the commandment of God, that you may
keep your tradition. <script type="text/javascript">cj(7,10);</script>For
Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother;’<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N16">*</a></sup></font> and, ‘He who speaks evil
of father or mother, let him be put to death.’<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N17">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cj(7,11);</script>But you say, ‘If a man tells
his father or his mother, “Whatever profit you might have received from
me is <a href="#N18">Corban</a>, that is to say, given to God”;’
<script type="text/javascript">cj(7,12);</script>then you no longer allow
him to do anything for his father or his mother, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(7,13);</script>making void the word of God by
your tradition, which you have handed down. You do many things like
this.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,14);</script>He called all the
multitude to himself, and said to them, <span class="j">“Hear me, all of
you, and understand. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(7,15);</script>There is nothing from outside of
the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed
out of the man are those that defile the man. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(7,16);</script>If anyone has ears to hear, let
him hear!”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,17);</script>When he had entered
into a house away from the multitude, his disciples asked him about the
parable. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,18);</script>He said to them,
<span class="j">“Are you thus without understanding also? Don’t you
perceive that whatever goes into the man from outside can’t defile him,
<script type="text/javascript">cj(7,19);</script>because it doesn’t go
into his heart, but into his stomach, then into the latrine, thus <a
href="#N19">purifying all foods</a>?”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,20);</script>He said, <span class="j">“That
which proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(7,21);</script>For from within, out of the
hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual sins, murders,
thefts, <script type="text/javascript">cj(7,22);</script>covetings,
wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, and
foolishness. <script type="text/javascript">cj(7,23);</script>All these
evil things come from within, and defile the man.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,24);</script>From there he arose,
and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. He entered into a house,
and didn’t want anyone to know it, but he couldn’t escape notice.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,25);</script>For a woman, whose little
daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at
his feet. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,26);</script>Now the woman
was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast
the demon out of her daughter. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,27);</script>But Jesus said to her, <span
class="j">“Let the children be filled first, for it is not appropriate
to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,28);</script>But she answered him,
“Yes, Lord. Yet even the dogs under the table eat the children’s
crumbs.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,29);</script>He said to her, <span
class="j">“For this saying, go your way. The demon has gone out of your
daughter.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,30);</script>She went away to her
house, and found the child having been laid on the bed, with the demon
gone out.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,31);</script>Again he departed from
the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and came to the sea of Galilee, through the
midst of the region of Decapolis. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,32);</script>They brought to him one who was
deaf and had an impediment in his speech. They begged him to lay his hand
on him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,33);</script>He took him aside
from the multitude, privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he
spat, and touched his tongue. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,34);</script>Looking up to heaven, he sighed,
and said to him, <span class="j">“Ephphatha!”</span> that is, <span
class="j">“Be opened!”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,35);</script>Immediately his ears were opened,
and the impediment of his tongue was released, and he spoke clearly.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,36);</script>He commanded them that
they should tell no one, but the more he commanded them, so much the more
widely they proclaimed it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,37);</script>They were astonished beyond
measure, saying, “He has done all things well. He makes even the deaf
hear, and the mute speak!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,1);</script>In those days, when
there was a very great multitude, and they had nothing to eat, Jesus
called his disciples to himself, and said to them, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,2);</script><span class="j">“I have
compassion on the multitude, because they have stayed with me now three
days, and have nothing to eat. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,3);</script>If I send them away fasting to
their home, they will faint on the way, for some of them have come a long
way.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,4);</script>His disciples answered
him, “From where could one satisfy these people with bread here in a
deserted place?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,5);</script>He asked them, <span
class="j">“How many loaves do you have?”</span>
<p>They said, “Seven.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,6);</script>He commanded the
multitude to sit down on the ground, and he took the seven loaves. Having
given thanks, he broke them, and gave them to his disciples to serve, and
they served the multitude. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,7);</script>They had a few small fish. Having
blessed them, he said to serve these also. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,8);</script>They ate, and were filled. They
took up seven baskets of broken pieces that were left over. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,9);</script>Those who had eaten were about
four thousand. Then he sent them away.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,10);</script>Immediately he entered
into the boat with his disciples, and came into the region of Dalmanutha.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,11);</script>The Pharisees came out
and began to question him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, and
testing him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,12);</script>He sighed
deeply in his spirit, and said, <span class="j">“Why does this <a
href="#N20">generation</a> seek a sign? Most certainly I tell you, no sign
will be given to this generation.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,13);</script>He left them, and
again entering into the boat, departed to the other side. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,14);</script>They forgot to take bread; and
they didn’t have more than one loaf in the boat with them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,15);</script>He warned them, saying, <span
class="j">“Take heed: beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast
of Herod.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,16);</script>They reasoned with one
another, saying, “It’s because we have no bread.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,17);</script>Jesus, perceiving it,
said to them, <span class="j">“Why do you reason that it’s because you
have no bread? Don’t you perceive yet, neither understand? Is your heart
still hardened? <script type="text/javascript">cj(8,18);</script>Having
eyes, don’t you see? Having ears, don’t you hear? Don’t you
remember? <script type="text/javascript">cj(8,19);</script>When I broke
the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken
pieces did you take up?”</span>
<p>They told him, “Twelve.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,20);</script><span
class="j">“When the seven loaves fed the four thousand, how many baskets
full of broken pieces did you take up?”</span>
<p>They told him, “Seven.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,21);</script>He asked them, <span
class="j">“Don’t you understand, yet?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,22);</script>He came to Bethsaida.
They brought a blind man to him, and begged him to touch him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,23);</script>He took hold of the blind man by
the hand, and brought him out of the village. When he had spit on his
eyes, and laid his hands on him, he asked him if he saw anything.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,24);</script>He looked up, and
said, “I see men; for I see them like trees walking.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,25);</script>Then again he laid his
hands on his eyes. He looked intently, and was restored, and saw everyone
clearly. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,26);</script>He sent him away
to his house, saying, <span class="j">“Don’t enter into the village,
nor tell anyone in the village.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,27);</script>Jesus went out, with
his disciples, into the villages of Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked
his disciples, <span class="j">“Who do men say that I am?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,28);</script>They told him, “John
the Baptizer, and others say Elijah, but others: one of the prophets.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,29);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“But who do you say that I am?”</span>
<p>Peter answered, “You are the Christ.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,30);</script>He commanded them that
they should tell no one about him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,31);</script>He began to teach them that the
Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, the
chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise
again. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,32);</script>He spoke to them
openly. Peter took him, and began to rebuke him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,33);</script>But he, turning around, and
seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter, and said, <span class="j">“Get
behind me, Satan! For you have in mind not the things of God, but the
things of men.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,34);</script>He called the
multitude to himself with his disciples, and said to them, <span
class="j">“Whoever wants to come after me, let him deny himself, and
take up his cross, and follow me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,35);</script>For whoever wants to save his
life will lose it; and whoever will lose his life for my sake and the sake
of the Good News will save it. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,36);</script>For what does it profit a man, to
gain the whole world, and forfeit his life? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,37);</script>For what will a man give in
exchange for his life? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,38);</script>For whoever will be ashamed of me
and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man
also will be ashamed of him, when he comes in the glory of his Father with
the holy angels.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,1);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Most certainly I tell you, there are some standing here who
will in no way taste death until they see the Kingdom of God come with
power.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,2);</script>After six days Jesus
took with him Peter, James, and John, and brought them up onto a high
mountain privately by themselves, and he was changed into another form in
front of them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,3);</script>His
clothing became glistening, exceedingly white, like snow, such as no
launderer on earth can whiten them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,4);</script>Elijah and Moses appeared to them,
and they were talking with Jesus.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,5);</script>Peter answered Jesus,
“Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let’s make three tents: one for
you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,6);</script>For he didn’t know what to say,
for they were very afraid.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,7);</script>A cloud came,
overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud, “This is my
beloved Son. Listen to him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,8);</script>Suddenly looking
around, they saw no one with them any more, except Jesus only.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,9);</script>As they were coming
down from the mountain, he commanded them that they should tell no one
what things they had seen, until after the Son of Man had risen from the
dead. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,10);</script>They kept this
saying to themselves, questioning what the “rising from the dead”
meant.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,11);</script>They asked him,
saying, “Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,12);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Elijah indeed comes first, and restores all things. How is it
written about the Son of Man, that he should suffer many things and be
despised? <script type="text/javascript">cj(9,13);</script>But I tell you
that Elijah has come, and they have also done to him whatever they wanted
to, even as it is written about him.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,14);</script>Coming to the
disciples, he saw a great multitude around them, and scribes questioning
them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,15);</script>Immediately all the
multitude, when they saw him, were greatly amazed, and running to him
greeted him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,16);</script>He asked the
scribes, <span class="j">“What are you asking them?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,17);</script>One of the multitude
answered, “Teacher, I brought to you my son, who has a mute spirit;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,18);</script>and wherever it seizes
him, it throws him down, and he foams at the mouth, and grinds his teeth,
and wastes away. I asked your disciples to cast it out, and they weren’t
able.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,19);</script>He answered him, <span
class="j">“Unbelieving generation, how long shall I be with you? How
long shall I bear with you? Bring him to me.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,20);</script>They brought him to
him, and when he saw him, immediately the spirit convulsed him, and he
fell on the ground, wallowing and foaming at the mouth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,21);</script>He asked his father,
<span class="j">“How long has it been since this has come to
him?”</span>
<p>He said, “From childhood. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,22);</script>Often it has cast him both into
the fire and into the water, to destroy him. But if you can do anything,
have compassion on us, and help us.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,23);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“If you can believe, all things are possible to him who
believes.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,24);</script>Immediately the father
of the child cried out with tears, “I believe. Help my unbelief!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,25);</script>When Jesus saw that a
multitude came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to
him, <span class="j">“You mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out
of him, and never enter him again!”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,26);</script>Having cried out, and
convulsed greatly, it came out of him. The boy became like one dead; so
much that most of them said, “He is dead.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,27);</script>But Jesus took him by the hand,
and raised him up; and he arose.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,28);</script>When he had come into
the house, his disciples asked him privately, “Why couldn’t we cast it
out?” <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,29);</script>He said to them,
<span class="j">“This kind can come out by nothing, except by prayer and
fasting.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,30);</script>They went out from
there, and passed through Galilee. He didn’t want anyone to know it.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,31);</script>For he was teaching his
disciples, and said to them, <span class="j">“The Son of Man is being
handed over to the hands of men, and they will kill him; and when he is
killed, on the third day he will rise again.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,32);</script>But they didn’t
understand the saying, and were afraid to ask him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,33);</script>He came to Capernaum,
and when he was in the house he asked them, <span class="j">“What were
you arguing among yourselves on the way?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,34);</script>But they were silent,
for they had disputed one with another on the way about who was the
greatest.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,35);</script>He sat down, and
called the twelve; and he said to them, <span class="j">“If any man
wants to be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all.”</span>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,36);</script>He took a little child,
and set him in their midst. Taking him in his arms, he said to them,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,37);</script><span
class="j">“Whoever receives one such little child in my name, receives
me, and whoever receives me, doesn’t receive me, but him who sent
me.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,38);</script>John said to him,
“Teacher, we saw someone who doesn’t follow us casting out demons in
your name; and we forbade him, because he doesn’t follow us.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,39);</script>But Jesus said, <span
class="j">“Don’t forbid him, for there is no one who will do a mighty
work in my name, and be able quickly to speak evil of me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(9,40);</script>For whoever is not against us is
on our side. <script type="text/javascript">cj(9,41);</script>For whoever
will give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because you are
Christ’s, most certainly I tell you, he will in no way lose his reward.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(9,42);</script>Whoever will cause one of
these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him
if he were thrown into the sea with a millstone hung around his neck.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(9,43);</script>If your hand causes you
to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed,
rather than having your two hands to go into <a href="#N21">Gehenna,</a>
into the unquenchable fire, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(9,44);</script>‘where their worm doesn’t
die, and the fire is not quenched.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(9,45);</script>If your foot causes you to
stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life lame, rather
than having your two feet to be cast into <a href="#N22">Gehenna,</a> into
the fire that will never be quenched—<script
type="text/javascript">cj(9,46);</script>‘where their worm doesn’t
die, and the fire is not quenched.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(9,47);</script>If your eye causes you to
stumble, cast it out. It is better for you to enter into the Kingdom of
God with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the <a
href="#N23">Gehenna</a> of fire, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(9,48);</script>‘where their worm doesn’t
die, and the fire is not quenched.’<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N24">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cj(9,49);</script>For everyone will be salted with
fire, and every sacrifice will be seasoned with salt. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(9,50);</script>Salt is good, but if the salt has
lost its saltiness, with what will you season it? Have salt in yourselves,
and be at peace with one another.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,1);</script>He arose from there
and came into the borders of Judea and beyond the Jordan. Multitudes came
together to him again. As he usually did, he was again teaching them.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(10,2);</script>Pharisees came to him
testing him, and asked him, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his
wife?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,3);</script>He answered, <span
class="j">“What did Moses command you?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,4);</script>They said, “Moses
allowed a certificate of divorce to be written, and to divorce her.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,5);</script>But Jesus said to
them, <span class="j">“For your hardness of heart, he wrote you this
commandment. <script type="text/javascript">cj(10,6);</script>But from the
beginning of the creation, God made them male and female.<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N25">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,7);</script>For this cause a man will leave
his father and mother, and will join to his wife, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,8);</script>and the two will become one
flesh,<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N26">*</a></sup></font>
so that they are no longer two, but one flesh. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,9);</script>What therefore God has joined
together, let no man separate.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,10);</script>In the house, his
disciples asked him again about the same matter. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,11);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Whoever divorces his wife, and marries another, commits
adultery against her. <script type="text/javascript">cj(10,12);</script>If
a woman herself divorces her husband, and marries another, she commits
adultery.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,13);</script>They were bringing to
him little children, that he should touch them, but the disciples rebuked
those who were bringing them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,14);</script>But when Jesus saw it, he was
moved with indignation, and said to them, <span class="j">“Allow the
little children to come to me! Don’t forbid them, for the Kingdom of God
belongs to such as these. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,15);</script>Most certainly I tell you,
whoever will not receive the Kingdom of God like a little child, he will
in no way enter into it.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,16);</script>He took them in his arms, and
blessed them, laying his hands on them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,17);</script>As he was going out
into the way, one ran to him, knelt before him, and asked him, “Good
Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,18);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“Why do you call me good? No one is good except
one—God. <script type="text/javascript">cj(10,19);</script>You know the
commandments: ‘Do not murder,’ ‘Do not commit adultery,’ ‘Do not
steal,’ ‘Do not give false testimony,’ ‘Do not defraud,’
‘Honor your father and mother.’”</span><font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N27">*</a></sup></font>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,20);</script>He said to him,
“Teacher, I have observed all these things from my youth.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,21);</script>Jesus looking at him
loved him, and said to him, <span class="j">“One thing you lack. Go,
sell whatever you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure
in heaven; and come, follow me, taking up the cross.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,22);</script>But his face fell at
that saying, and he went away sorrowful, for he was one who had great
possessions. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,23);</script>Jesus
looked around, and said to his disciples, <span class="j">“How difficult
it is for those who have riches to enter into the Kingdom of God!”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,24);</script>The disciples were
amazed at his words. But Jesus answered again, <span
class="j">“Children, how hard is it for those who trust in riches to
enter into the Kingdom of God! <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,25);</script>It is easier for a camel to go
through a needle’s eye than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of
God.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,26);</script>They were exceedingly
astonished, saying to him, “Then who can be saved?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,27);</script>Jesus, looking at
them, said, <span class="j">“With men it is impossible, but not with
God, for all things are possible with God.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,28);</script>Peter began to tell
him, “Behold, we have left all, and have followed you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,29);</script>Jesus said, <span
class="j">“Most certainly I tell you, there is no one who has left
house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or
children, or land, for my sake, and for the sake of the Good News, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,30);</script>but he will receive one hundred
times more now in this time, houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children,
and land, with persecutions; and in the age to come eternal life. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,31);</script>But many who are first will be
last; and the last first.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,32);</script>They were on the way,
going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was going in front of them, and they were
amazed; and those who followed were afraid. He again took the twelve, and
began to tell them the things that were going to happen to him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,33);</script><span class="j">“Behold, we
are going up to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be delivered to the chief
priests and the scribes. They will condemn him to death, and will deliver
him to the Gentiles. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,34);</script>They will mock him, spit on him,
scourge him, and kill him. On the third day he will rise again.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,35);</script>James and John, the
sons of Zebedee, came near to him, saying, “Teacher, we want you to do
for us whatever we will ask.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,36);</script>He said to them,
<span class="j">“What do you want me to do for you?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,37);</script>They said to him,
“Grant to us that we may sit, one at your right hand, and one at your
left hand, in your glory.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,38);</script>But Jesus said to
them, <span class="j">“You don’t know what you are asking. Are you
able to drink the cup that I drink, and to be baptized with the baptism
that I am baptized with?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,39);</script>They said to him,
“We are able.”
<p>Jesus said to them, <span class="j">“You shall indeed drink the cup
that I drink, and you shall be baptized with the baptism that I am
baptized with; <script type="text/javascript">cj(10,40);</script>but to
sit at my right hand and at my left hand is not mine to give, but for whom
it has been prepared.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,41);</script>When the ten heard
it, they began to be indignant towards James and John.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,42);</script>Jesus summoned them,
and said to them, <span class="j">“You know that they who are recognized
as rulers over the nations lord it over them, and their great ones
exercise authority over them. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,43);</script>But it shall not be so among
you, but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(10,44);</script>Whoever of you wants to
become first among you, shall be bondservant of all. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,45);</script>For the Son of Man also came not
to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for
many.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,46);</script>They came to Jericho.
As he went out from Jericho, with his disciples and a great multitude, the
son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the road.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(10,47);</script>When he heard that it
was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out, and say, “Jesus, you son of
David, have mercy on me!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,48);</script>Many rebuked him, that he should
be quiet, but he cried out much more, “You son of David, have mercy on
me!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,49);</script>Jesus stood still,
and said, <span class="j">“Call him.”</span>
<p>They called the blind man, saying to him, “Cheer up! Get up. He is
calling you!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,50);</script>He, casting away his
cloak, sprang up, and came to Jesus.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,51);</script>Jesus asked him,
<span class="j">“What do you want me to do for you?”</span>
<p>The blind man said to him, “<a href="#N28">Rabboni,</a> that I may
see again.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,52);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“Go your way. Your faith has made you well.”</span>
Immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,1);</script>When they drew near to
Jerusalem, to <a href="#N29">Bethsphage</a> and Bethany, at the Mount of
Olives, he sent two of his disciples, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,2);</script>and said to them, <span
class="j">“Go your way into the village that is opposite you.
Immediately as you enter into it, you will find a young donkey tied, on
which no one has sat. Untie him, and bring him. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,3);</script>If anyone asks you, ‘Why are
you doing this?’ say, ‘The Lord needs him;’ and immediately he will
send him back here.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,4);</script>They went away, and
found a young donkey tied at the door outside in the open street, and they
untied him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,5);</script>Some of those
who stood there asked them, “What are you doing, untying the young
donkey?” <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,6);</script>They said to
them just as Jesus had said, and they let them go.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,7);</script>They brought the young
donkey to Jesus, and threw their garments on it, and Jesus sat on it.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,8);</script>Many spread their
garments on the way, and others were cutting down branches from the trees,
and spreading them on the road. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,9);</script>Those who went in front, and
those who followed, cried out, “<a href="#N30">Hosanna</a>! Blessed is

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,11);</script>Jesus entered into
the temple in Jerusalem. When he had looked around at everything, it being
now evening, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,12);</script>The next day, when
they had come out from Bethany, he was hungry. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,13);</script>Seeing a fig tree afar off
having leaves, he came to see if perhaps he might find anything on it.
When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season
for figs. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,14);</script>Jesus told it,
<span class="j">“May no one ever eat fruit from you again!”</span> and
his disciples heard it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,15);</script>They came to
Jerusalem, and Jesus entered into the temple, and began to throw out those
who sold and those who bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of
the money changers, and the seats of those who sold the doves. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,16);</script>He would not allow anyone to
carry a container through the temple. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,17);</script>He taught, saying to them, <span
class="j">“Isn’t it written, ‘My house will be called a house of
prayer for all the nations?’<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,18);</script>The chief priests and
the scribes heard it, and sought how they might destroy him. For they
feared him, because all the multitude was astonished at his teaching.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,19);</script>When evening came, he
went out of the city. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,20);</script>As
they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away from
the roots. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,21);</script>Peter,
remembering, said to him, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree which you cursed
has withered away.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,22);</script>Jesus answered them,
<span class="j">“Have faith in God. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,23);</script>For most certainly I tell you,
whoever may tell this mountain, ‘Be taken up and cast into the sea,’
and doesn’t doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says is
happening; he shall have whatever he says. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,24);</script>Therefore I tell you, all things
whatever you pray and ask for, believe that you have received them, and
you shall have them. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,25);</script>Whenever you stand praying,
forgive, if you have anything against anyone; so that your Father, who is
in heaven, may also forgive you your transgressions. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,26);</script>But if you do not forgive,
neither will your Father in heaven forgive your transgressions.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,27);</script>They came again to
Jerusalem, and as he was walking in the temple, the chief priests, and the
scribes, and the elders came to him, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,28);</script>and they began saying to him,
“By what authority do you do these things? Or who gave you this
authority to do these things?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,29);</script>Jesus said to them,
<span class="j">“I will ask you one question. Answer me, and I will tell
you by what authority I do these things. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,30);</script>The baptism of John—was it
from heaven, or from men? Answer me.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,31);</script>They reasoned with
themselves, saying, “If we should say, ‘From heaven;’ he will say,
‘Why then did you not believe him?’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,32);</script>If we should say, ‘From
men’”—they feared the people, for all held John to really be a
prophet. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,33);</script>They answered
Jesus, “We don’t know.”
<p>Jesus said to them, <span class="j">“Neither do I tell you by what
authority I do these things.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,1);</script>He began to speak to
them in parables. <span class="j">“A man planted a vineyard, put a hedge
around it, dug a pit for the winepress, built a tower, rented it out to a
farmer, and went into another country. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,2);</script>When it was time, he sent a
servant to the farmer to get from the farmer his share of the fruit of the
vineyard. <script type="text/javascript">cj(12,3);</script>They took him,
beat him, and sent him away empty. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,4);</script>Again, he sent another servant to
them; and they threw stones at him, wounded him in the head, and sent him
away shamefully treated. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,5);</script>Again he sent another; and they
killed him; and many others, beating some, and killing some. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,6);</script>Therefore still having one, his
beloved son, he sent him last to them, saying, ‘They will respect my
son.’ <script type="text/javascript">cj(12,7);</script>But those farmers
said among themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him, and
the inheritance will be ours.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,8);</script>They took him, killed him, and
cast him out of the vineyard. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,9);</script>What therefore will the lord of
the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the farmers, and will give the
vineyard to others. <script

Scripture:</span>

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,12);</script>They tried to seize
him, but they feared the multitude; for they perceived that he spoke the
parable against them. They left him, and went away. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,13);</script>They sent some of the Pharisees
and of the Herodians to him, that they might trap him with words. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,14);</script>When they had come, they asked
him, “Teacher, we know that you are honest, and don’t defer to anyone;
for you aren’t partial to anyone, but truly teach the way of God. Is it
lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,15);</script>Shall we give, or shall we not
give?”
<p>But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, <span class="j">“Why
do you test me? Bring me a denarius, that I may see it.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,16);</script>They brought it.
<p>He said to them, <span class="j">“Whose is this image and
inscription?”</span>
<p>They said to him, “Caesar’s.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,17);</script>Jesus answered them,
<span class="j">“Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to
God the things that are God’s.”</span>
<p>They marveled greatly at him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,18);</script>There came to him
Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection. They asked him, saying,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(12,19);</script>“Teacher, Moses wrote
to us, ‘If a man’s brother dies, and leaves a wife behind him, and
leaves no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up
offspring for his brother.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,20);</script>There were seven brothers. The
first took a wife, and dying left no offspring. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,21);</script>The second took her, and died,
leaving no children behind him. The third likewise; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,22);</script>and the seven took her and left
no children. Last of all the woman also died. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,23);</script>In the resurrection, when they
rise, whose wife will she be of them? For the seven had her as a wife.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,24);</script>Jesus answered them,
<span class="j">“Isn’t this because you are mistaken, not knowing the
Scriptures, nor the power of God? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,25);</script>For when they will rise from the
dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like angels
in heaven. <script type="text/javascript">cj(12,26);</script>But about the
dead, that they are raised; haven’t you read in the book of Moses, about
the Bush, how God spoke to him, saying, ‘I am the God of Abraham, the
God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N35">*</a></sup></font>? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,27);</script>He is not the God of the dead,
but of the living. You are therefore badly mistaken.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,28);</script>One of the scribes
came, and heard them questioning together. Knowing that he had answered
them well, asked him, “Which commandment is the greatest of all?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,29);</script>Jesus answered, <span
class="j">“The greatest is, ‘Hear, Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord
is one: <script type="text/javascript">cj(12,30);</script>you shall love
the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with
all your mind, and with all your strength.’<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N36">*</a></sup></font> This is the first
commandment. <script type="text/javascript">cj(12,31);</script>The second
is like this, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N37">*</a></sup></font> There is no
other commandment greater than these.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,32);</script>The scribe said to
him, “Truly, teacher, you have said well that he is one, and there is
none other but he, <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,33);</script>and
to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, with all
the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as himself,
is more important than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,34);</script>When Jesus saw that
he answered wisely, he said to him, <span class="j">“You are not far
from the Kingdom of God.”</span>
<p>No one dared ask him any question after that. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,35);</script>Jesus responded, as he taught in
the temple, <span class="j">“How is it that the scribes say that the
Christ is the son of David? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,36);</script>For David himself said in the
Holy Spirit,</span>
<dl><span class="j">

</dl>
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,37);</script>Therefore David himself calls
him Lord, so how can he be his son?”</span>
<p>The common people heard him gladly. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,38);</script>In his teaching he said to them,
<span class="j">“Beware of the scribes, who like to walk in long robes,
and to get greetings in the marketplaces, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,39);</script>and the best seats in the
synagogues, and the best places at feasts: <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,40);</script>those who devour widows’
houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. These will receive greater
condemnation.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,41);</script>Jesus sat down
opposite the treasury, and saw how the multitude cast money into the
treasury. Many who were rich cast in much. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,42);</script>A poor widow came, and she cast
in two <a href="#N39">small brass coins,</a> which equal a <a
href="#N40">quadrans coin.</a> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,43);</script>He called his disciples to
himself, and said to them, <span class="j">“Most certainly I tell you,
this poor widow gave more than all those who are giving into the treasury,
<script type="text/javascript">cj(12,44);</script>for they all gave out of
their abundance, but she, out of her poverty, gave all that she had to
live on.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,1);</script>As he went out of the
temple, one of his disciples said to him, “Teacher, see what kind of
stones and what kind of buildings!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,2);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“Do you see these great buildings? There will not be
left here one stone on another, which will not be thrown down.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,3);</script>As he sat on the Mount
of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him
privately, <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,4);</script>“Tell us,
when will these things be? What is the sign that these things are all
about to be fulfilled?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,5);</script>Jesus, answering,
began to tell them, <span class="j">“Be careful that no one leads you
astray. <script type="text/javascript">cj(13,6);</script>For many will
come in my name, saying, ‘<a href="#N41">I am he!</a>’ and will lead
many astray.
</span><p><span class="j"><script

rumors of wars, don’t be troubled. For those must happen, but the end is
not yet. <script type="text/javascript">cj(13,8);</script>For nation will
rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be
earthquakes in various places. There will be famines and troubles. These
things are the beginning of birth pains. <script

will deliver you up to councils. You will be beaten in synagogues. You
will stand before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them.

be preached to all the nations. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,11);</script>When they lead you away and
deliver you up, don’t be anxious beforehand, or premeditate what you
will say, but say whatever will be given you in that hour. For it is not
you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.

had shortened the days, no flesh would have been saved; but for the sake

‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or, ‘Look, there!’ don’t believe it.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(13,22);</script>For there will arise

before the feast of the Passover and the unleavened bread, and the chief
priests and the scribes sought how they might seize him by deception, and
kill him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,2);</script>For they said,
“Not during the feast, because there might be a riot of the people.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,3);</script>While he was at
Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at the table, a woman
came having an alabaster jar of ointment of pure nard—very costly. She
broke the jar, and poured it over his head. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,4);</script>But there were some who were
indignant among themselves, saying, “Why has this ointment been wasted?
<script type="text/javascript">cb(14,5);</script>For this might have been
sold for more than <a href="#N45">three hundred denarii,</a> and given to
the poor.” They grumbled against her.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,6);</script>But Jesus said, <span

work for me. <script type="text/javascript">cj(14,7);</script>For you
always have the poor with you, and whenever you want to, you can do them
good; but you will not always have me. <script

has anointed my body beforehand for the burying. <script

which this woman has done will also be spoken of for a memorial of
her.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,10);</script>Judas Iscariot, who
was one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests, that he might
deliver him to them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,11);</script>They, when they heard it, were
glad, and promised to give him money. He sought how he might conveniently
deliver him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,12);</script>On the
first day of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the Passover, his
disciples asked him, “Where do you want us to go and prepare that you
may eat the Passover?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,13);</script>He sent two of his
disciples, and said to them, <span class="j">“Go into the city, and
there you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water. Follow him, <script

the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says, “Where is the guest room,
where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?”’ <script

upper room furnished and ready. Get ready for us there.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,16);</script>His disciples went
out, and came into the city, and found things as he had said to them, and
they prepared the Passover.

he came with the twelve. <script

Jesus said, <span class="j">“Most certainly I tell you, one of you will
betray me—he who eats with me.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,19);</script>They began to be
sorrowful, and to ask him one by one, “Surely not I?” And another
said, “Surely not I?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,20);</script>He answered them,
<span class="j">“It is one of the twelve, he who dips with me in the
dish. <script type="text/javascript">cj(14,21);</script>For the Son of Man
goes, even as it is written about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son

born.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,22);</script>As they were eating,
Jesus took bread, and when he had blessed, he broke it, and gave to them,
and said, <span class="j">“Take, eat. This is my body.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,23);</script>He took the cup, and
when he had given thanks, he gave to them. They all drank of it. <script

went out to the Mount of Olives.

him, “Although all will be offended, yet I will not.”

night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three
times.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,31);</script>But he spoke all the
more, “If I must die with you, I will not deny you.” They all said the
same thing.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,32);</script>They came to a place
which was named Gethsemane. He said to his disciples, <span

type="text/javascript">cb(14,33);</script>He took with him Peter, James,
and John, and began to be greatly troubled and distressed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,34);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here,
and watch.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,35);</script>He went forward a
little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the
hour might pass away from him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,36);</script>He said, <span
class="j">“Abba, Father, all things are possible to you. Please remove
this cup from me. However, not what I desire, but what you
desire.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,37);</script>He came and found
them sleeping, and said to Peter, <span class="j">“Simon, are you
sleeping? Couldn’t you watch one hour? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,38);</script>Watch and pray, that you may not
enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is
weak.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,39);</script>Again he went away,
and prayed, saying the same words. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,40);</script>Again he returned, and found
them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy, and they didn’t know what
to answer him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,41);</script>He came
the third time, and said to them, <span class="j">“Sleep on now, and
take your rest. It is enough. The hour has come. Behold, the Son of Man is
betrayed into the hands of sinners. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,42);</script>Arise, let us be going. Behold,
he who betrays me is at hand.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,43);</script>Immediately, while he
was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, came—and with him a
multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests, the scribes, and
the elders. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,44);</script>Now he who
betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, “Whomever I will kiss, that
is he. Seize him, and lead him away safely.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,45);</script>When he had come, immediately he
came to him, and said, “Rabbi! Rabbi!” and kissed him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,46);</script>They laid their hands on him,
and seized him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,47);</script>But a
certain one of those who stood by drew his sword, and struck the servant
of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,48);</script>Jesus answered them,
<span class="j">“Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and
clubs to seize me? <script type="text/javascript">cj(14,49);</script>I was
daily with you in the temple teaching, and you didn’t arrest me. But
this is so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,50);</script>They all left him,
and fled. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,51);</script>A certain
young man followed him, having a linen cloth thrown around himself, over
his naked body. The young men grabbed him, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,52);</script>but he left the linen cloth, and
fled from them naked. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,53);</script>They led Jesus away to the high
priest. All the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes came together
with him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,54);</script>Peter had followed
him from a distance, until he came into the court of the high priest. He
was sitting with the officers, and warming himself in the light of the
fire. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,55);</script>Now the chief
priests and the whole council sought witnesses against Jesus to put him to
death, and found none. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,56);</script>For many gave false testimony
against him, and their testimony didn’t agree with each other. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,57);</script>Some stood up, and gave false
testimony against him, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,58);</script>“We heard him say, ‘I will
destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will
build another made without hands.’” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,59);</script>Even so, their testimony did not
agree.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,60);</script>The high priest stood
up in the midst, and asked Jesus, “Have you no answer? What is it which
these testify against you?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,61);</script>But he stayed quiet, and
answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, “Are you the Christ,
the Son of the Blessed?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,62);</script>Jesus said, <span
class="j">“I am. You will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand
of Power, and coming with the clouds of the sky.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,63);</script>The high priest tore
his clothes, and said, “What further need have we of witnesses? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,64);</script>You have heard the blasphemy!
What do you think?” They all condemned him to be worthy of death.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(14,65);</script>Some began to spit on
him, and to cover his face, and to beat him with fists, and to tell him,
“Prophesy!” The officers struck him with the palms of their hands.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,66);</script>As Peter was in the
courtyard below, one of the maids of the high priest came, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,67);</script>and seeing Peter warming
himself, she looked at him, and said, “You were also with the Nazarene,
Jesus!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,68);</script>But he denied it,
saying, “I neither know, nor understand what you are saying.” He went
out on the porch, and the rooster crowed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,69);</script>The maid saw him, and
began again to tell those who stood by, “This is one of them.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,70);</script>But he again denied it. After a
little while again those who stood by said to Peter, “You truly are one
of them, for you are a Galilean, and your speech shows it.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,71);</script>But he began to curse, and to
swear, “I don’t know this man of whom you speak!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,72);</script>The rooster crowed the second
time. Peter remembered the word, how that Jesus said to him, <span
class="j">“Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three
times.”</span> When he thought about that, he wept.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,1);</script>Immediately in the
morning the chief priests, with the elders and scribes, and the whole
council, held a consultation, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and
delivered him up to Pilate. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,2);</script>Pilate asked him, “Are you the
King of the Jews?”
<p>He answered, <span class="j">“So you say.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,3);</script>The chief priests
accused him of many things. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,4);</script>Pilate again asked him, “Have
you no answer? See how many things they testify against you!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,5);</script>But Jesus made no
further answer, so that Pilate marveled.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,6);</script>Now at the feast he
used to release to them one prisoner, whom they asked of him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,7);</script>There was one called Barabbas,
bound with those who had made insurrection, men who in the insurrection
had committed murder. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,8);</script>The
multitude, crying aloud, began to ask him to do as he always did for them.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(15,9);</script>Pilate answered them,
saying, “Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(15,10);</script>For he perceived that
for envy the chief priests had delivered him up. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,11);</script>But the chief priests stirred up
the multitude, that he should release Barabbas to them instead. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,12);</script>Pilate again asked them, “What
then should I do to him whom you call the King of the Jews?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,13);</script>They cried out again,
“Crucify him!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,14);</script>Pilate said to them,
“Why, what evil has he done?”
<p>But they cried out exceedingly, “Crucify him!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,15);</script>Pilate, wishing to
please the multitude, released Barabbas to them, and handed over Jesus,
when he had flogged him, to be crucified. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,16);</script>The soldiers led him away within
the court, which is the Praetorium; and they called together the whole
cohort. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,17);</script>They clothed him
with purple, and weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,18);</script>They began to salute him,
“Hail, King of the Jews!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,19);</script>They struck his head with a
reed, and spat on him, and bowing their knees, did homage to him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,20);</script>When they had mocked him, they
took the purple off of him, and put his own garments on him. They led him
out to crucify him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,21);</script>They
compelled one passing by, coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene, the
father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them, that he might bear his
cross. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,22);</script>They brought him
to the place called Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, “The place of
a skull.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,23);</script>They offered
him wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but he didn’t take it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,24);</script>Crucifying him, they
parted his garments among them, casting lots on them, what each should
take. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,25);</script>It was <a
href="#N47">the third hour,</a> and they crucified him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,26);</script>The superscription of his
accusation was written over him, “THE KING OF THE JEWS.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,27);</script>With him they crucified two
robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,28);</script><a href="#N48">The Scripture was
fulfilled, which says, “He was numbered with transgressors.”</a>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,29);</script>Those who passed by
blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and saying, “Ha! You who destroy
the temple, and build it in three days, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,30);</script>save yourself, and come down
from the cross!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,31);</script>Likewise, also the
chief priests mocking among themselves with the scribes said, “He saved
others. He can’t save himself. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,32);</script>Let the Christ, the King of
Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe <a
href="#N49">him.</a>” Those who were crucified with him insulted him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,33);</script>When the <a
href="#N50">sixth hour</a> had come, there was darkness over the whole
land until the <a href="#N51">ninth hour.</a> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,34);</script>At the ninth hour Jesus cried
with a loud voice, saying, <span class="j">“Eloi, Eloi, lama
sabachthani?”</span> which is, being interpreted, <span class="j">“My
God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”</span><font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N52">*</a></sup></font>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,35);</script>Some of those who
stood by, when they heard it, said, “Behold, he is calling Elijah.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,36);</script>One ran, and filling
a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink,
saying, “Let him be. Let’s see whether Elijah comes to take him
down.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,37);</script>Jesus cried out with
a loud voice, and gave up the spirit. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,38);</script>The veil of the temple was torn
in two from the top to the bottom. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,39);</script>When the centurion, who stood by
opposite him, saw that he cried out like this and breathed his last, he
said, “Truly this man was the Son of God!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,40);</script>There were also women
watching from afar, among whom were both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the
mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,41);</script>who, when he was in Galilee,
followed him, and served him; and many other women who came up with him to
Jerusalem.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,42);</script>When evening had now
come, because it was the Preparation Day, that is, the day before the
Sabbath, <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,43);</script>Joseph of
Arimathaea, a prominent council member who also himself was looking for
the Kingdom of God, came. He boldly went in to Pilate, and asked for
Jesus’ body. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,44);</script>Pilate
marveled if he were already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked
him whether he had been dead long. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,45);</script>When he found out from the
centurion, he granted the body to Joseph. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,46);</script>He bought a linen cloth, and
taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb
which had been cut out of a rock. He rolled a stone against the door of
the tomb. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,47);</script>Mary Magdalene
and Mary, the mother of Joses, saw where he was laid.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,1);</script>When the Sabbath was
past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought
spices, that they might come and anoint him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,2);</script>Very early on the first day of
the week, they came to the tomb when the sun had risen. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,3);</script>They were saying among
themselves, “Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for
us?” <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,4);</script>for it was very
big. Looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled back.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,5);</script>Entering into the
tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white
robe, and they were amazed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,6);</script>He said to them, “Don’t be
amazed. You seek Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He has
risen. He is not here. Behold, the place where they laid him! <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,7);</script>But go, tell his disciples and
Peter, ‘He goes before you into Galilee. There you will see him, as he
said to you.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,8);</script>They went out,<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N53">*</a></sup></font> and fled
from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had come on them. They said
nothing to anyone; for they were afraid. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,9);</script>Now when he had risen early on
the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom
he had cast out seven demons. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,10);</script>She went and told those who had
been with him, as they mourned and wept. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,11);</script>When they heard that he was
alive, and had been seen by her, they disbelieved. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,12);</script>After these things he was
revealed in another form to two of them, as they walked, on their way into
the country. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,13);</script>They went
away and told it to the rest. They didn’t believe them, either.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,14);</script>Afterward he was
revealed to the eleven themselves as they sat at the table, and he rebuked
them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they didn’t
believe those who had seen him after he had risen. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,15);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Go into all the world, and preach the Good News to the whole
creation. <script type="text/javascript">cj(16,16);</script>He who
believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who disbelieves will be
condemned. <script type="text/javascript">cj(16,17);</script>These signs
will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons;
they will speak with new languages; <script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,18);</script>they will take up serpents; and
if they drink any deadly thing, it will in no way hurt them; they will lay
hands on the sick, and they will recover.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,19);</script>So then the Lord<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N54">*</a></sup></font>, after he
had spoken to them, was received up into heaven, and sat down at the right
hand of God. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,20);</script>They went
out, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming
the word by the signs that followed. Amen.

The Good News According to Matthew
</h1><p>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,1);</script>The book of the genealogy
of Jesus <a href="#N1">Christ</a>, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,2);</script>Abraham became the father
of Isaac. Isaac became the father of Jacob. Jacob became the father of
Judah and his brothers. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,3);</script>Judah became the father of Perez
and Zerah by Tamar. Perez became the father of Hezron. Hezron became the
father of Ram. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,4);</script>Ram became
the father of Amminadab. Amminadab became the father of Nahshon. Nahshon
became the father of Salmon. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,5);</script>Salmon became the father of Boaz
by Rahab. Boaz became the father of Obed by Ruth. Obed became the father
of Jesse. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,6);</script>Jesse became the
father of King David. David became the father of Solomon by her who had
been the wife of Uriah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,7);</script>Solomon became the father of
Rehoboam. Rehoboam became the father of Abijah. Abijah became the father
of Asa. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,8);</script>Asa became the
father of Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat became the father of Joram. Joram
became the father of Uzziah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,9);</script>Uzziah became the father of
Jotham. Jotham became the father of Ahaz. Ahaz became the father of
Hezekiah. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,10);</script>Hezekiah became
the father of Manasseh. Manasseh became the father of Amon. Amon became
the father of Josiah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,11);</script>Josiah became the father of
Jechoniah and his brothers, at the time of the exile to Babylon. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,12);</script>After the exile to Babylon,
Jechoniah became the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel became the father of
Zerubbabel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,13);</script>Zerubbabel
became the father of Abiud. Abiud became the father of Eliakim. Eliakim
became the father of Azor. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,14);</script>Azor became the father of Sadoc.
Sadoc became the father of Achim. Achim became the father of Eliud.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,15);</script>Eliud became the father
of Eleazar. Eleazar became the father of Matthan. Matthan became the
father of Jacob. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,16);</script>Jacob
became the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, from whom was born <a
href="#N2">Jesus</a>, who is called Christ. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,17);</script>So all the generations from
Abraham to David are fourteen generations; from David to the exile to
Babylon fourteen generations; and from the carrying away to Babylon to the
Christ, fourteen generations.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,18);</script>Now the birth of Jesus
Christ was like this; for after his mother, Mary, was engaged to Joseph,
before they came together, she was found pregnant by the Holy Spirit.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,19);</script>Joseph, her husband,
being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example,
intended to put her away secretly. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,20);</script>But when he thought about these
things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying,
“Joseph, son of David, don’t be afraid to take to yourself Mary, your
wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,21);</script>She shall bring forth a son. You
shall call his name Jesus, for it is he who shall save his people from
their sins.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,22);</script>Now all this has
happened, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through
the prophet, saying,
<dl>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,23);</script>“Behold, the virgin
shall be with child,
<dd>and shall bring forth a son.
<dt>They shall call his name Immanuel”;
<dd>which is, being interpreted, “God with us.”<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N3">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,24);</script>Joseph arose from his
sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took his wife
to himself; <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,25);</script>and didn’t
know her sexually until she had brought forth her firstborn son. He named
him Jesus.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,1);</script>Now when Jesus was born
in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of King Herod, behold, <a
href="#N4">wise men</a> from the east came to Jerusalem, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,2);</script>“Where is he who is born King of
the Jews? For we saw his star in the east, and have come to worship
him.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,3);</script>When King Herod
heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,4);</script>Gathering together all the chief
priests and scribes of the people, he asked them where the Christ would be
born. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,5);</script>They said to him,
“In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is written through the prophet, 
<dl>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,6);</script>‘You Bethlehem, land
of Judah,
<dd>are in no way least among the princes of Judah:
<dt>for out of you shall come forth a governor,
<dd>who shall shepherd my people, Israel.’”<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N5">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,7);</script>Then Herod secretly
called the wise men, and learned from them exactly what time the star
appeared. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,8);</script>He sent them to
Bethlehem, and said, “Go and search diligently for the young child. When
you have found him, bring me word, so that I also may come and worship
him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,9);</script>They, having heard the
king, went their way; and behold, the star, which they saw in the east,
went before them, until it came and stood over where the young child was.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,10);</script>When they saw the star,
they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,11);</script>They came into the house and saw
the young child with Mary, his mother, and they fell down and worshiped
him. Opening their treasures, they offered to him gifts: gold,
frankincense, and myrrh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,12);</script>Being warned in a dream that they
shouldn’t return to Herod, they went back to their own country another
way.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,13);</script>Now when they had
departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream,
saying, “Arise and take the young child and his mother, and flee into
Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, for Herod will seek the young
child to destroy him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,14);</script>He arose and took the
young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,15);</script>and was there until the death of
Herod; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the
prophet, saying, “Out of Egypt I called my son.”<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N6">*</a></sup></font>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,16);</script>Then Herod, when he
saw that he was mocked by the wise men, was exceedingly angry, and sent
out, and killed all the male children who were in Bethlehem and in all the
surrounding countryside, from two years old and under, according to the
exact time which he had learned from the wise men. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,17);</script>Then that which was spoken by
Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying,
<dl>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,18);</script>“A voice was heard
in Ramah,
<dd>lamentation, weeping and great mourning,
<dt>Rachel weeping for her children;
<dd>she wouldn’t be comforted,
<dd>because they are no more.”<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N7">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,19);</script>But when Herod was
dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,20);</script>“Arise and take
the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel, for those
who sought the young child’s life are dead.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,21);</script>He arose and took the
young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,22);</script>But when he heard that Archelaus
was reigning over Judea in the place of his father, Herod, he was afraid
to go there. Being warned in a dream, he withdrew into the region of
Galilee, <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,23);</script>and came and
lived in a city called Nazareth; that it might be fulfilled which was
spoken through the prophets: “He will be called a Nazarene.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,1);</script>In those days, John the
Baptizer came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,2);</script>“Repent, for the Kingdom of
Heaven is at hand!” <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,3);</script>For
this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet, saying,
<dl>
<dt>“The voice of one crying in the wilderness,
<dd>make ready the way of the Lord.
<dd>Make his paths straight.”<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N8">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,4);</script>Now John himself wore
clothing made of camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist. His
food was locusts and wild honey. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,5);</script>Then people from Jerusalem, all of
Judea, and all the region around the Jordan went out to him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,6);</script>They were <a
href="#N9">baptized</a> by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,7);</script>But when he saw many of
the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for his <a href="#N10">baptism,</a> he
said to them, “You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the
wrath to come? <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,8);</script>Therefore
bring forth fruit worthy of repentance! <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,9);</script>Don’t think to yourselves, ‘We
have Abraham for our father,’ for I tell you that God is able to raise
up children to Abraham from these stones.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,10);</script>“Even now the axe
lies at the root of the trees. Therefore every tree that doesn’t bring
forth good fruit is cut down, and cast into the fire. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,11);</script>I indeed <a
href="#N11">baptize</a> you in water for repentance, but he who comes
after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to carry. He will
baptize you in the Holy Spirit.<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N12">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,12);</script>His winnowing fork is in his
hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor. He will gather
his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable
fire.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,13);</script>Then Jesus came from
Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,14);</script>But John would have hindered him,
saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and you come to me?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,15);</script>But Jesus, answering,
said to him, <span class="j">“Allow it now, for this is the fitting way
for us to fulfill all righteousness.”</span> Then he allowed him.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,16);</script>Jesus, when he was
baptized, went up directly from the water: and behold, the heavens were
opened to him. He saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming
on him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,17);</script>Behold, a voice
out of the heavens said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well
pleased.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,1);</script>Then Jesus was led up
by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,2);</script>When he had fasted forty days and
forty nights, he was hungry afterward. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,3);</script>The tempter came and said to him,
“If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,4);</script>But he answered, <span
class="j">“It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by
every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.’”</span><font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N13">*</a></sup></font>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,5);</script>Then the devil took him
into the holy city. He set him on the pinnacle of the temple, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,6);</script>and said to him, “If you are the
Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, ‘He will put his
angels in charge of you.’ and,
<dl>
<dt>‘On their hands they will bear you up,
<dd>so that you don’t dash your foot against a stone.’”<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N14">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,7);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“Again, it is written, ‘You shall not test the Lord,
your God.’”</span><font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N15">*</a></sup></font>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,8);</script>Again, the devil took
him to an exceedingly high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of
the world, and their glory. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,9);</script>He said to him, “I will give you
all of these things, if you will fall down and worship me.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,10);</script>Then Jesus said to
him, <span class="j">“<a href="#N16">Get behind me,</a> Satan! For it is
written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and you shall serve him
only.’”</span><font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N17">*</a></sup></font>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,11);</script>Then the devil left
him, and behold, angels came and served him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,12);</script>Now when Jesus heard that John
was delivered up, he withdrew into Galilee. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,13);</script>Leaving Nazareth, he came and
lived in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and
Naphtali, <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,14);</script>that it might
be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,
<dl>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,15);</script>“The land of
Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,
<dd>toward the sea, beyond the Jordan,
<dd>Galilee of the Gentiles,
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,16);</script>the people who sat in
darkness saw a great light,
<dd>to those who sat in the region and shadow of death,
<dd>to them light has dawned.”<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N18">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,17);</script>From that time, Jesus
began to preach, and to say, <span class="j">“Repent! For the Kingdom of
Heaven is at hand.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,18);</script>Walking by the sea of
Galilee, <a href="#N19">he</a> saw two brothers: Simon, who is called
Peter, and Andrew, his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were
fishermen. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,19);</script>He said to
them, <span class="j">“Come after me, and I will make you fishers for
men.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,20);</script>They immediately left
their nets and followed him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,21);</script>Going on from there, he saw two
other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the
boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. He called them.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,22);</script>They immediately left the
boat and their father, and followed him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,23);</script>Jesus went about in
all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the Good News of the
Kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,24);</script>The report about him went
out into all Syria. They brought to him all who were sick, afflicted with
various diseases and torments, possessed with demons, epileptics, and
paralytics; and he healed them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,25);</script>Great multitudes from Galilee,
Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea and from beyond the Jordan followed him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,1);</script>Seeing the multitudes,
he went up onto the mountain. When he had sat down, his disciples came to
him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,2);</script>He opened his mouth
and taught them, saying,
<dl>

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,5);</script>When he came into

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,7);</script>Jesus said to him,

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,8);</script>The centurion answered,
“Lord, I’m not worthy for you to come under my roof. Just say the

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,10);</script>When Jesus heard it,
he marveled, and said to those who followed, <span class="j">“Most

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,14);</script>When Jesus came into

<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,15);</script>He touched her hand, and
the fever left her. She got up and served <a href="#N42">him.</a> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,16);</script>When evening came, they brought
to him many possessed with demons. He cast out the spirits with a word,
and healed all who were sick; <script

was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying: “He took our infirmities,

said to him, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,20);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have
nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,21);</script>Another of his

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,22);</script>But Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own
dead.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,23);</script>When he got into a
boat, his disciples followed him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,24);</script>Behold, a violent storm came up
on the sea, so much that the boat was covered with the waves, but he was
asleep. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,25);</script>They came to him,
and woke him up, saying, “Save us, Lord! We are dying!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,26);</script>He said to them, <span

got up, rebuked the wind and the sea, and there was a great calm.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,27);</script>The men marveled,
saying, “What kind of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey
him?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,28);</script>When he came to the
other side, into the country of the <a href="#N44">Gergesenes,</a> two
people possessed by demons met him there, coming out of the tombs,
exceedingly fierce, so that nobody could pass that way. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,29);</script>Behold, they cried out, saying,
“What do we have to do with you, Jesus, Son of God? Have you come here
to torment us before the time?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,30);</script>Now there was a herd of many pigs
feeding far away from them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,31);</script>The demons begged him, saying,
“If you cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of pigs.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,32);</script>He said to them, <span

<p>They came out, and went into the herd of pigs: and behold, the whole
herd of pigs rushed down the cliff into the sea, and died in the water.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,33);</script>Those who fed them fled,
and went away into the city, and told everything, including what happened
to those who were possessed with demons. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,34);</script>Behold, all the city came out to
meet Jesus. When they saw him, they begged that he would depart from their
borders.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,1);</script>He entered into a boat,
and crossed over, and came into his own city. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,2);</script>Behold, they brought to him a man
who was paralyzed, lying on a bed. Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the
paralytic, <span class="j">“Son, cheer up! Your sins are forgiven

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,3);</script>Behold, some of the
scribes said to themselves, “This man blasphemes.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,4);</script>Jesus, knowing their
thoughts, said, <span class="j">“Why do you think evil in your hearts?
<script type="text/javascript">cj(9,5);</script>For which is easier, to
say, ‘Your sins are forgiven;’ or to say, ‘Get up, and walk?’
<script type="text/javascript">cj(9,6);</script>But that you may know that
the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins...”</span> (then
he said to the paralytic), <span class="j">“Get up, and take up your
mat, and go up to your house.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,7);</script>He arose and departed
to his house. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,8);</script>But when the
multitudes saw it, they marveled and glorified God, who had given such
authority to men.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,9);</script>As Jesus passed by from
there, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax collection office.
He said to him, <span class="j">“Follow me.”</span> He got up and
followed him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,10);</script>It happened
as he sat in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and
sat down with Jesus and his disciples. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,11);</script>When the Pharisees saw it, they
said to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors
and sinners?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,12);</script>When Jesus heard it,
he said to them, <span class="j">“Those who are healthy have no need for
a physician, but those who are sick do. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(9,13);</script>But you go and learn what this
means: ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,’<font color="#0000ff"

righteous, but sinners <a href="#N46">to repentance.</a>”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,14);</script>Then John’s
disciples came to him, saying, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast often,
but your disciples don’t fast?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,15);</script>Jesus said to them,
<span class="j">“Can the friends of the bridegroom mourn, as long as the
bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will
be taken away from them, and then they will fast. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(9,16);</script>No one puts a piece of unshrunk

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,18);</script>While he told these
things to them, behold, a ruler came and worshiped him, saying, “My
daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her, and she will
live.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,19);</script>Jesus got up and
followed him, as did his disciples. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,20);</script>Behold, a woman who had an issue
of blood for twelve years came behind him, and touched the <a

“If I just touch his garment, I will be made well.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,22);</script>But Jesus, turning
around and seeing her, said, <span class="j">“Daughter, cheer up! Your
faith has made you well.”</span> And the woman was made well from that
hour.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,23);</script>When Jesus came into
the ruler’s house, and saw the flute players, and the crowd in noisy
disorder, <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,24);</script>he said to
them, <span class="j">“Make room, because the girl isn’t dead, but
sleeping.”</span>
<p>They were ridiculing him. <script

he entered in, took her by the hand, and the girl arose. <script

all that land. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,27);</script>As Jesus
passed by from there, two blind men followed him, calling out and saying,
“Have mercy on us, son of David!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,28);</script>When he had come into
the house, the blind men came to him. Jesus said to them, <span
class="j">“Do you believe that I am able to do this?”</span>
<p>They told him, “Yes, Lord.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,29);</script>Then he touched their
eyes, saying, <span class="j">“According to your faith be it done to
you.”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,30);</script>Their eyes
were opened. Jesus strictly commanded them, saying, <span class="j">“See
that no one knows about this.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,31);</script>But they went out and spread
abroad his fame in all that land.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,32);</script>As they went out,
behold, a mute man who was demon possessed was brought to him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,33);</script>When the demon was cast out, the
mute man spoke. The multitudes marveled, saying, “Nothing like this has
ever been seen in Israel!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,34);</script>But the Pharisees
said, “By the prince of the demons, he casts out demons.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,35);</script>Jesus went about all
the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching
the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness
among the people. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,36);</script>But
when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion for them, because
they were <a href="#N48">harassed</a> and scattered, like sheep without a
shepherd. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,37);</script>Then he said to
his disciples, <span class="j">“The harvest indeed is plentiful, but the
laborers are few. <script type="text/javascript">cj(9,38);</script>Pray
therefore that the Lord of the harvest will send out laborers into his
harvest.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,1);</script>He called to himself
his twelve disciples, and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to
cast them out, and to heal every disease and every sickness. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,2);</script>Now the names of the twelve
apostles are these. The first, Simon, who is called Peter; Andrew, his
brother; James the son of Zebedee; John, his brother; <script

Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus; <a
href="#N49">Lebbaeus, whose surname was</a> Thaddaeus; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,4);</script>Simon the Canaanite; and Judas
Iscariot, who also betrayed him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,5);</script>Jesus sent these
twelve out, and commanded them, saying, <span class="j">“Don’t go
among the Gentiles, and don’t enter into any city of the Samaritans.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(10,6);</script>Rather, go to the lost
sheep of the house of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,7);</script>As you go, preach, saying, ‘The

take any gold, nor silver, nor brass in your money belts. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,10);</script>Take no bag for your journey,
neither two coats, nor shoes, nor staff: for the laborer is worthy of his
food. <script type="text/javascript">cj(10,11);</script>Into whatever city

you go on. <script type="text/javascript">cj(10,12);</script>As you enter
into the household, greet it. <script

they will scourge you. <script

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,1);</script>It happened that when
Jesus had finished directing his twelve disciples, he departed from there
to teach and preach in their cities. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,2);</script>Now when John heard in the prison
the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,3);</script>and said to him, “Are you he
who comes, or should we look for another?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,4);</script>Jesus answered them,
<span class="j">“Go and tell John the things which you hear and see:
<script type="text/javascript">cj(11,5);</script>the blind receive their
sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear,<font

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,7);</script>As these went their
way, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John, <span

by the wind? <script type="text/javascript">cj(11,8);</script>But what did
you go out to see? A man in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft
clothing are in king’s houses. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,9);</script>But why did you go out? To see a
prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,10);</script>For this is he, of whom it is
written, ‘Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare

he. <script type="text/javascript">cj(11,12);</script>From the days of
John the Baptizer until now, the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence, and
the violent <a href="#N57">take it by force.</a> <script

it, this is Elijah, who is to come. <script

hear.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,16);</script>“But to what shall I compare
this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces, who call
to their companions <script type="text/javascript">cj(11,17);</script>and
say, ‘We played the flute for you, and you didn’t dance. We mourned
for you, and you didn’t lament.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,18);</script>For John came neither eating nor
drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,19);</script>The Son of Man came eating and
drinking, and they say, ‘Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a
friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ But wisdom is justified by her <a

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,20);</script>Then he began to
denounce the cities in which most of his mighty works had been done,
because they didn’t repent. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,21);</script><span class="j">“Woe to you,
Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in
Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago
in sackcloth and ashes. <script

tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,23);</script>You, Capernaum, who are exalted
to heaven, you will go down to <a href="#N59">Hades.</a> For if the mighty

remained until this day. <script

more tolerable for the land of Sodom, on the day of judgment, than for
you.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,25);</script>At that time, Jesus
answered, <span class="j">“I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and
earth, that you hid these things from the wise and understanding, and
revealed them to infants. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,26);</script>Yes, Father, for so it was
well-pleasing in your sight. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,27);</script>All things have been delivered
to me by my Father. No one knows the Son, except the Father; neither does
anyone know the Father, except the Son, and he to whom the Son desires to
reveal him.

is easy, and my burden is light.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,1);</script>At that time, Jesus
went on the Sabbath day through the grain fields. His disciples were
hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,2);</script>But the Pharisees, when they saw
it, said to him, “Behold, your disciples do what is not lawful to do on
the Sabbath.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,3);</script>But he said to them,
<span class="j">“Haven’t you read what David did, when he was hungry,
and those who were with him; <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,4);</script>how he entered into God’s
house, and ate the show bread, which was not lawful for him to eat,

tell you that one greater than the temple is here. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,7);</script>But if you had known what this
means, ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,’<font color="#0000ff"

condemned the guiltless. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,8);</script>For the Son of Man is Lord of the
Sabbath.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,9);</script>He departed there, and
went into their synagogue. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,10);</script>And behold there was a man with
a withered hand. They asked him, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath
day?” that they might accuse him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,11);</script>He said to them,
<span class="j">“What man is there among you, who has one sheep, and if
this one falls into a pit on the Sabbath day, won’t he grab on to it,
and lift it out? <script type="text/javascript">cj(12,12);</script>Of how
much more value then is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do
good on the Sabbath day.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,13);</script>Then he told the man, <span
class="j">“Stretch out your hand.”</span> He stretched it out; and it
was restored whole, just like the other. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,14);</script>But the Pharisees went out, and
conspired against him, how they might destroy him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,15);</script>Jesus, perceiving that, withdrew
from there. Great multitudes followed him; and he healed them all, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,16);</script>and commanded them that they
should not make him known: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,17);</script>that it might be fulfilled which
was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,

<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,18);</script>“Behold, my
servant whom I have chosen;
<dd>my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased:
<dt>I will put my Spirit on him.

<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,19);</script>He will not strive,
nor shout;
<dd>neither will anyone hear his voice in the streets.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,20);</script>He won’t break a
bruised reed.
<dd>He won’t quench a smoking flax,

</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,22);</script>Then one possessed by
a demon, blind and mute, was brought to him and he healed him, so that the
blind and mute man both spoke and saw. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,23);</script>All the multitudes were amazed,
and said, “Can this be the son of David?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,24);</script>But when the Pharisees heard it,
they said, “This man does not cast out demons, except by Beelzebul, the
prince of the demons.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,25);</script>Knowing their
thoughts, Jesus said to them, <span class="j">“Every kingdom divided
against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided
against itself will not stand. <script

he says, ‘I will return into my house from which I came out,’ and when

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,11);</script>He answered them,
<span class="j">“To you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom
of Heaven, but it is not given to them. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,12);</script>For whoever has, to him will be
given, and he will have abundance, but whoever doesn’t have, from him
will be taken away even that which he has. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,13);</script>Therefore I speak to them in
parables, because seeing they don’t see, and hearing, they don’t hear,
neither do they understand. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,14);</script>In them the prophecy of Isaiah
is fulfilled, which says, </span>
<dl><span class="j">
<dt>‘By hearing you will hear,
<dd>and will in no way understand;
<dt>Seeing you will see,
<dd>and will in no way perceive:
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cj(13,15);</script>for this people’s
heart has grown callous,
<dd>their ears are dull of hearing,
<dd>they have closed their eyes;
<dt>or else perhaps they might perceive with their eyes,
<dd>hear with their ears,
<dd>understand with their heart,
<dt>and should turn again;
<dd>and I would heal them.’<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a

</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,16);</script>“But blessed are your eyes,
for they see; and your ears, for they hear. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,17);</script>For most certainly I tell you
that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which you
see, and didn’t see them; and to hear the things which you hear, and
didn’t hear them.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,18);</script>“Hear, then, the parable of
the farmer. <script type="text/javascript">cj(13,19);</script>When anyone
hears the word of the Kingdom, and doesn’t understand it, the evil one
comes, and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart. This is
what was sown by the roadside. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,20);</script>What was sown on the rocky
places, this is he who hears the word, and immediately with joy receives
it; <script type="text/javascript">cj(13,21);</script>yet he has no root
in himself, but endures for a while. When oppression or persecution arises
because of the word, immediately he stumbles. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,22);</script>What was sown among the thorns,
this is he who hears the word, but the cares of this age and the
deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,23);</script>What was sown on the good
ground, this is he who hears the word, and understands it, who most
certainly bears fruit, and brings forth, some one hundred times as much,
some sixty, and some thirty.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,24);</script>He set another
parable before them, saying, <span class="j">“The Kingdom of Heaven is
like a man who sowed good seed in his field, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,25);</script>but while people slept, his
enemy came and sowed <a href="#N65">darnel weeds</a> also among the wheat,
and went away. <script type="text/javascript">cj(13,26);</script>But when
the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit, then the darnel weeds
appeared also. <script type="text/javascript">cj(13,27);</script>The
servants of the householder came and said to him, ‘Sir, didn’t you sow
good seed in your field? Where did this darnel come from?’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,28);</script>“He said to them, ‘An enemy
has done this.’
</span><p><span class="j">“The servants asked him, ‘Do you want us to
go and gather them up?’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,29);</script>“But he said, ‘No, lest
perhaps while you gather up the darnel weeds, you root up the wheat with
them. <script type="text/javascript">cj(13,30);</script>Let both grow
together until the harvest, and in the harvest time I will tell the
reapers, “First, gather up the darnel weeds, and bind them in bundles to
burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.”’”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,31);</script>He set another
parable before them, saying, <span class="j">“The Kingdom of Heaven is
like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field;
<script type="text/javascript">cj(13,32);</script>which indeed is smaller
than all seeds. But when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and
becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its
branches.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,33);</script>He spoke another
parable to them. <span class="j">“The Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast,
which a woman took, and hid in three <a href="#N66">measures</a> of meal,
until it was all leavened.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,34);</script>Jesus spoke all these
things in parables to the multitudes; and without a parable, he didn’t
speak to them, <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,35);</script>that it
might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying, 
<dl>
<dt>“I will open my mouth in parables;
<dd>I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.”<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N67">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,36);</script>Then Jesus sent the
multitudes away, and went into the house. His disciples came to him,
saying, “Explain to us the parable of the darnel weeds of the field.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,37);</script>He answered them,
<span class="j">“He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,38);</script>the field is the world; and the
good seed, these are the children of the Kingdom; and the darnel weeds are
the children of the evil one. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,39);</script>The enemy who sowed them is the
devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(13,40);</script>As therefore the darnel
weeds are gathered up and burned with fire; so will it be at the end of
this age. <script type="text/javascript">cj(13,41);</script>The Son of Man
will send out his angels, and they will gather out of his Kingdom all
things that cause stumbling, and those who do iniquity, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,42);</script>and will cast them into the
furnace of fire. There will be weeping and the gnashing of teeth. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,43);</script>Then the righteous will shine
forth like the sun in the Kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to
hear, let him hear.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,44);</script>“Again, the Kingdom of Heaven
is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found, and hid. In his
joy, he goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,45);</script>“Again, the Kingdom of Heaven
is like a man who is a merchant seeking fine pearls, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,46);</script>who having found one pearl of
great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,47);</script>“Again, the Kingdom of Heaven
is like a dragnet, that was cast into the sea, and gathered some fish of
every kind, <script type="text/javascript">cj(13,48);</script>which, when
it was filled, they drew up on the beach. They sat down, and gathered the
good into containers, but the bad they threw away. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,49);</script>So will it be in the end of the
world. The angels will come forth, and separate the wicked from among the
righteous, <script type="text/javascript">cj(13,50);</script>and will cast
them into the furnace of fire. There will be the weeping and the gnashing
of teeth.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,51);</script>Jesus said to them, <span
class="j">“Have you understood all these things?”</span>
<p>They answered him, “Yes, Lord.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,52);</script>He said to them,
<span class="j">“Therefore every scribe who has been made a disciple in
the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a householder, who brings out
of his treasure new and old things.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,53);</script>It happened that when
Jesus had finished these parables, he departed from there. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,54);</script>Coming into his own country, he
taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said,
“Where did this man get this wisdom, and these mighty works? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,55);</script>Isn’t this the carpenter’s
son? Isn’t his mother called Mary, and his brothers, James, Joses,
Simon, and <a href="#N68">Judas</a>? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,56);</script>Aren’t all of his sisters with
us? Where then did this man get all of these things?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,57);</script>They were offended by him.
<p>But Jesus said to them, <span class="j">“A prophet is not without
honor, except in his own country, and in his own house.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,58);</script>He didn’t do many mighty works
there because of their unbelief.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,1);</script>At that time, Herod
the tetrarch heard the report concerning Jesus, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,2);</script>and said to his servants, “This
is John the Baptizer. He is risen from the dead. That is why these powers
work in him.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,3);</script>For Herod
had laid hold of John, and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake
of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,4);</script>For John said to him, “It is
not lawful for you to have her.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,5);</script>When he would have put him to
death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(14,6);</script>But when Herod’s
birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced among them and pleased
Herod. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,7);</script>Whereupon he
promised with an oath to give her whatever she should ask. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,8);</script>She, being prompted by her
mother, said, “Give me here on a platter the head of John the
Baptizer.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,9);</script>The king was grieved,
but for the sake of his oaths, and of those who sat at the table with him,
he commanded it to be given, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,10);</script>and he sent and beheaded John in
the prison. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,11);</script>His head was
brought on a platter, and given to the young lady: and she brought it to
her mother. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,12);</script>His
disciples came, and took the body, and buried it; and they went and told
Jesus. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,13);</script>Now when Jesus
heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat, to a deserted place apart.
When the multitudes heard it, they followed him on foot from the cities.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,14);</script>Jesus went out, and
he saw a great multitude. He had compassion on them, and healed their
sick. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,15);</script>When evening had
come, his disciples came to him, saying, “This place is deserted, and
the hour is already late. Send the multitudes away, that they may go into
the villages, and buy themselves food.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,16);</script>But Jesus said to
them, <span class="j">“They don’t need to go away. You give them
something to eat.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,17);</script>They told him, “We
only have here five loaves and two fish.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,18);</script>He said, <span
class="j">“Bring them here to me.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,19);</script>He commanded the multitudes to
sit down on the grass; and he took the five loaves and the two fish, and
looking up to heaven, he blessed, broke and gave the loaves to the
disciples, and the disciples gave to the multitudes. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,20);</script>They all ate, and were filled.
They took up twelve baskets full of that which remained left over from the
broken pieces. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,21);</script>Those who
ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,22);</script>Immediately Jesus
made the disciples get into the boat, and to go ahead of him to the other
side, while he sent the multitudes away. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,23);</script>After he had sent the multitudes
away, he went up into the mountain by himself to pray. When evening had
come, he was there alone. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,24);</script>But the boat was now in the
middle of the sea, distressed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(14,25);</script>In <a href="#N69">the
fourth watch of the night,</a> Jesus came to them, walking on the
sea.<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N70">*</a></sup></font>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(14,26);</script>When the disciples saw
him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, “It’s a ghost!”
and they cried out for fear. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,27);</script>But immediately Jesus spoke to
them, saying <span class="j">“Cheer up! <a href="#N71">It is I!</a>
Don’t be afraid.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,28);</script>Peter answered him
and said, “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the
waters.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,29);</script>He said, <span
class="j">“Come!”</span>
<p>Peter stepped down from the boat, and walked on the waters to come to
Jesus. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,30);</script>But when he saw
that the wind was strong, he was afraid, and beginning to sink, he cried
out, saying, “Lord, save me!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,31);</script>Immediately Jesus
stretched out his hand, took hold of him, and said to him, <span
class="j">“You of little faith, why did you doubt?”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,32);</script>When they got up into the boat,
the wind ceased. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,33);</script>Those
who were in the boat came and worshiped him, saying, “You are truly the
Son of God!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,34);</script>When they had crossed
over, they came to the land of Gennesaret. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,35);</script>When the people of that place
recognized him, they sent into all that surrounding region, and brought to
him all who were sick, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,36);</script>and they begged him that they
might just touch the <a href="#N72">fringe</a> of his garment. As many as
touched it were made whole.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,1);</script>Then Pharisees and
scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,2);</script>“Why do your disciples disobey
the tradition of the elders? For they don’t wash their hands when they
eat bread.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,3);</script>He answered them,
<span class="j">“Why do you also disobey the commandment of God because
of your tradition? <script type="text/javascript">cj(15,4);</script>For
God commanded, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N73">*</a></sup></font> and, ‘He
who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.’<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N74">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,5);</script>But you say, ‘Whoever may tell
his father or his mother, “Whatever help you might otherwise have gotten
from me is a gift devoted to God,” <script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,6);</script>he shall not honor his father or
mother.’ You have made the commandment of God void because of your
tradition. <script type="text/javascript">cj(15,7);</script>You
hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,</span>
<dl><span class="j">
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cj(15,8);</script>‘These people draw
near to me with their mouth,
<dd>and honor me with their lips;
<dd>but their heart is far from me.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cj(15,9);</script>And in vain do they
worship me,
<dd>teaching as doctrine rules made by men.’”</span><font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N75">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,10);</script>He summoned the
multitude, and said to them, <span class="j">“Hear, and understand.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(15,11);</script>That which enters into
the mouth doesn’t defile the man; but that which proceeds out of the
mouth, this defiles the man.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,12);</script>Then the disciples
came, and said to him, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended,
when they heard this saying?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,13);</script>But he answered,
<span class="j">“Every plant which my heavenly Father didn’t plant
will be uprooted. <script type="text/javascript">cj(15,14);</script>Leave
them alone. They are blind guides of the blind. If the blind guide the
blind, both will fall into a pit.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,15);</script>Peter answered him,
“Explain the parable to us.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,16);</script>So Jesus said, <span
class="j">“Do you also still not understand? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,17);</script>Don’t you understand that
whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly, and then out of the
body? <script type="text/javascript">cj(15,18);</script>But the things
which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart, and they defile the
man. <script type="text/javascript">cj(15,19);</script>For out of the
heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual sins, thefts,
false testimony, and blasphemies. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,20);</script>These are the things which
defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands doesn’t defile the
man.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,21);</script>Jesus went out from
there, and withdrew into the region of Tyre and Sidon. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,22);</script>Behold, a Canaanite woman came
out from those borders, and cried, saying, “Have mercy on me, Lord, you
son of David! My daughter is severely demonized!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,23);</script>But he answered her
not a word.
<p>His disciples came and begged him, saying, “Send her away; for she
cries after us.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,24);</script>But he answered,
<span class="j">“I wasn’t sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the
house of Israel.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,25);</script>But she came and
worshiped him, saying, “Lord, help me.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,26);</script>But he answered,
<span class="j">“It is not appropriate to take the children’s bread
and throw it to the dogs.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,27);</script>But she said, “Yes,
Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters’
table.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,28);</script>Then Jesus answered
her, <span class="j">“Woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you even
as you desire.”</span> And her daughter was healed from that hour.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,29);</script>Jesus departed there,
and came near to the sea of Galilee; and he went up into the mountain, and
sat there. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,30);</script>Great
multitudes came to him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed,
and many others, and they put them down at his feet. He healed them,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(15,31);</script>so that the multitude
wondered when they saw the mute speaking, injured whole, lame walking, and
blind seeing—and they glorified the God of Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,32);</script>Jesus summoned his
disciples and said, <span class="j">“I have compassion on the multitude,
because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat. I
don’t want to send them away fasting, or they might faint on the
way.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,33);</script>The disciples said to
him, “Where should we get so many loaves in a deserted place as to
satisfy so great a multitude?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,34);</script>Jesus said to them,
<span class="j">“How many loaves do you have?”</span>
<p>They said, “Seven, and a few small fish.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,35);</script>He commanded the
multitude to sit down on the ground; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,36);</script>and he took the seven loaves and
the fish. He gave thanks and broke them, and gave to the disciples, and
the disciples to the multitudes. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,37);</script>They all ate, and were filled.
They took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(15,38);</script>Those who ate were four
thousand men, besides women and children. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,39);</script>Then he sent away the
multitudes, got into the boat, and came into the borders of Magdala.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,1);</script>The Pharisees and
Sadducees came, and testing him, asked him to show them a sign from
heaven. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,2);</script>But he answered
them, <span class="j">“When it is evening, you say, ‘It will be fair
weather, for the sky is red.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,3);</script>In the morning, ‘It will be
foul weather today, for the sky is red and threatening.’ Hypocrites! You
know how to discern the appearance of the sky, but you can’t discern the
signs of the times! <script type="text/javascript">cj(16,4);</script>An
evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and there will be no
sign given to it, except the sign of the prophet Jonah.”</span>
<p>He left them, and departed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,5);</script>The disciples came to the other
side and had forgotten to take bread. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,6);</script>Jesus said to them, <span
class="j">“Take heed and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and
Sadducees.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,7);</script>They reasoned among
themselves, saying, “We brought no bread.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,8);</script>Jesus, perceiving it,
said, <span class="j">“Why do you reason among yourselves, you of little
faith, ‘because you have brought no bread?’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,9);</script>Don’t you yet perceive, neither
remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you
took up? <script type="text/javascript">cj(16,10);</script>Nor the seven
loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you took up? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,11);</script>How is it that you don’t
perceive that I didn’t speak to you concerning bread? But beware of the
yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,12);</script>Then they understood
that he didn’t tell them to beware of the yeast of bread, but of the
teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,13);</script>Now when Jesus came into the
parts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, <span
class="j">“Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,14);</script>They said, “Some
say John the Baptizer, some, Elijah, and others, Jeremiah, or one of the
prophets.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,15);</script>He said to them,
<span class="j">“But who do you say that I am?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,16);</script>Simon Peter answered,
“You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,17);</script>Jesus answered him,
<span class="j">“Blessed are you, Simon Bar Jonah, for flesh and blood
has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,18);</script>I also tell you that you are <a
href="#N76">Peter,</a> and on this <a href="#N77">rock</a> I will build my
assembly, and the gates of <a href="#N78">Hades</a> will not prevail
against it. <script type="text/javascript">cj(16,19);</script>I will give
to you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and whatever you bind on earth
will have been bound in heaven; and whatever you release on earth will
have been released in heaven.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,20);</script>Then he commanded the disciples
that they should tell no one that he was Jesus the Christ. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,21);</script>From that time, Jesus began to
show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things
from the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and the third
day be raised up.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,22);</script>Peter took him aside,
and began to rebuke him, saying, “Far be it from you, Lord! This will
never be done to you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,23);</script>But he turned, and
said to Peter, <span class="j">“Get behind me, Satan! You are a
stumbling block to me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of
God, but on the things of men.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,24);</script>Then Jesus said to his
disciples, <span class="j">“If anyone desires to come after me, let him
deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,25);</script>For whoever desires to save his
life will lose it, and whoever will lose his life for my sake will find
it. <script type="text/javascript">cj(16,26);</script>For what will it
profit a man, if he gains the whole world, and forfeits his life? Or what
will a man give in exchange for his life? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,27);</script>For the Son of Man will come in
the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will render to
everyone according to his deeds. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,28);</script>Most certainly I tell you, there
are some standing here who will in no way taste of death, until they see
the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,1);</script>After six days, Jesus
took with him Peter, James, and John his brother, and brought them up into
a high mountain by themselves. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,2);</script>He was transfigured before them.
His face shone like the sun, and his garments became as white as the
light. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,3);</script>Behold, Moses and
Elijah appeared to them talking with him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,4);</script>Peter answered, and
said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you want, let’s
make three tents here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,5);</script>While he was still
speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. Behold, a voice came
out of the cloud, saying, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well
pleased. Listen to him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,6);</script>When the disciples
heard it, they fell on their faces, and were very afraid. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,7);</script>Jesus came and touched them and
said, <span class="j">“Get up, and don’t be afraid.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,8);</script>Lifting up their eyes, they saw
no one, except Jesus alone. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,9);</script>As they were coming down from the
mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, <span class="j">“Don’t tell
anyone what you saw, until the Son of Man has risen from the
dead.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,10);</script>His disciples asked
him, saying, “Then why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,11);</script>Jesus answered them,
<span class="j">“Elijah indeed comes first, and will restore all things,
<script type="text/javascript">cj(17,12);</script>but I tell you that
Elijah has come already, and they didn’t recognize him, but did to him
whatever they wanted to. Even so the Son of Man will also suffer by
them.”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,13);</script>Then the
disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the Baptizer.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,14);</script>When they came to the
multitude, a man came to him, kneeling down to him, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,15);</script>“Lord, have mercy on my son,
for he is epileptic, and suffers grievously; for he often falls into the
fire, and often into the water. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,16);</script>So I brought him to your
disciples, and they could not cure him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,17);</script>Jesus answered, <span
class="j">“Faithless and perverse generation! How long will I be with
you? How long will I bear with you? Bring him here to me.”</span>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(17,18);</script>Jesus rebuked him, the
demon went out of him, and the boy was cured from that hour.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,19);</script>Then the disciples
came to Jesus privately, and said, “Why weren’t we able to cast it
out?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,20);</script>He said to them,
<span class="j">“Because of your unbelief. For most certainly I tell
you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will tell this
mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move; and nothing
will be impossible for you. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(17,21);</script>But this kind doesn’t go out
except by prayer and fasting.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,22);</script>While they were
staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them, <span class="j">“The Son of Man
is about to be delivered up into the hands of men, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(17,23);</script>and they will kill him, and the
third day he will be raised up.”</span>
<p>They were exceedingly sorry. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,24);</script>When they had come to Capernaum,
those who collected the <a href="#N79">didrachma coins</a> came to Peter,
and said, “Doesn’t your teacher pay the didrachma?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,25);</script>He said, “Yes.”
<p>When he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, <span
class="j">“What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth
receive toll or tribute? From their children, or from strangers?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,26);</script>Peter said to him,
“From strangers.”
<p>Jesus said to him, <span class="j">“Therefore the children are
exempt. <script type="text/javascript">cj(17,27);</script>But, lest we
cause them to stumble, go to the sea, cast a hook, and take up the first
fish that comes up. When you have opened its mouth, you will find a <a
href="#N80">stater coin.</a> Take that, and give it to them for me and
you.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,1);</script>In that hour the
disciples came to Jesus, saying, “Who then is greatest in the Kingdom of
Heaven?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,2);</script>Jesus called a little
child to himself, and set him in their midst, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,3);</script>and said, <span class="j">“Most
certainly I tell you, unless you turn, and become as little children, you
will in no way enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,4);</script>Whoever therefore humbles himself
as this little child, the same is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(18,5);</script>Whoever receives one such
little child in my name receives me, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,6);</script>but whoever causes one of these
little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him that
a huge millstone should be hung around his neck, and that he should be
sunk in the depths of the sea.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,7);</script>“Woe to the world because of
occasions of stumbling! For it must be that the occasions come, but woe to
that person through whom the occasion comes! <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,8);</script>If your hand or your foot causes
you to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from you. It is better for you to
enter into life maimed or crippled, rather than having two hands or two
feet to be cast into the eternal fire. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,9);</script>If your eye causes you to
stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter
into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the <a
href="#N81">Gehenna</a> of fire. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,10);</script>See that you don’t despise one
of these little ones, for I tell you that in heaven their angels always
see the face of my Father who is in heaven. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,11);</script>For the Son of Man came to save
that which was lost.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,12);</script>“What do you think? If a man
has one hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, doesn’t he leave the
ninety-nine, go to the mountains, and seek that which has gone astray?
<script type="text/javascript">cj(18,13);</script>If he finds it, most
certainly I tell you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine
which have not gone astray. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,14);</script>Even so it is not the will of
your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,15);</script>“If your brother sins against
you, go, show him his fault between you and him alone. If he listens to
you, you have gained back your brother. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,16);</script>But if he doesn’t listen, take
one or two more with you, that at the mouth of two or three witnesses
every word may be established.<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N82">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,17);</script>If he refuses to listen to them,
tell it to the assembly. If he refuses to hear the assembly also, let him
be to you as a Gentile or a tax collector. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,18);</script>Most certainly I tell you,
whatever things you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven, and
whatever things you release on earth will have been released in heaven.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(18,19);</script>Again, assuredly I tell
you, that if two of you will agree on earth concerning anything that they
will ask, it will be done for them by my Father who is in heaven. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,20);</script>For where two or three are
gathered together in my name, there I am in their midst.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,21);</script>Then Peter came and
said to him, “Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I
forgive him? Until seven times?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,22);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“I don’t tell you until seven times, but, until
seventy times seven. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,23);</script>Therefore the Kingdom of Heaven
is like a certain king, who wanted to reconcile accounts with his
servants. <script type="text/javascript">cj(18,24);</script>When he had
begun to reconcile, one was brought to him who owed him <a href="#N83">ten
thousand talents.</a> <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,25);</script>But because he couldn’t pay,
his lord commanded him to be sold, with his wife, his children, and all
that he had, and payment to be made. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,26);</script>The servant therefore fell down
and kneeled before him, saying, ‘Lord, have patience with me, and I will
repay you all!’ <script type="text/javascript">cj(18,27);</script>The
lord of that servant, being moved with compassion, released him, and
forgave him the debt.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,28);</script>“But that servant went out,
and found one of his fellow servants, who owed him <a href="#N84">one
hundred denarii,</a> and he grabbed him, and took him by the throat,
saying, ‘Pay me what you owe!’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,29);</script>“So his fellow servant fell
down at his feet and begged him, saying, ‘Have patience with me, and I
will repay you!’ <script type="text/javascript">cj(18,30);</script>He
would not, but went and cast him into prison, until he should pay back
that which was due. <script type="text/javascript">cj(18,31);</script>So
when his fellow servants saw what was done, they were exceedingly sorry,
and came and told to their lord all that was done. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,32);</script>Then his lord called him in, and
said to him, ‘You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt, because
you begged me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,33);</script>Shouldn’t you also have had
mercy on your fellow servant, even as I had mercy on you?’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,34);</script>His lord was angry, and
delivered him to the tormentors, until he should pay all that was due to
him. <script type="text/javascript">cj(18,35);</script>So my heavenly
Father will also do to you, if you don’t each forgive your brother from
your hearts for his misdeeds.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,1);</script>It happened when Jesus
had finished these words, he departed from Galilee, and came into the
borders of Judea beyond the Jordan. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,2);</script>Great multitudes followed him,
and he healed them there. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,3);</script>Pharisees came to him, testing
him, and saying, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any
reason?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,4);</script>He answered, <span
class="j">“Haven’t you read that he who made them from the beginning
made them male and female,<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N85">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cj(19,5);</script>and said, ‘For this cause a man
shall leave his father and mother, and shall join to his wife; and the two
shall become one flesh?’<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N86">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cj(19,6);</script>So that they are no more two, but
one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, don’t let man tear
apart.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,7);</script>They asked him, “Why
then did Moses command us to give her a bill of divorce, and divorce
her?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,8);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, allowed you to
divorce your wives, but from the beginning it has not been so. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(19,9);</script>I tell you that whoever divorces
his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits
adultery; and he who marries her when she is divorced commits
adultery.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,10);</script>His disciples said to
him, “If this is the case of the man with his wife, it is not expedient
to marry.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,11);</script>But he said to them,
<span class="j">“Not all men can receive this saying, but those to whom
it is given. <script type="text/javascript">cj(19,12);</script>For there
are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother’s womb, and there
are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs who made
themselves eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven’s sake. He who is able to
receive it, let him receive it.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,13);</script>Then little children
were brought to him, that he should lay his hands on them and pray; and
the disciples rebuked them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,14);</script>But Jesus said, <span
class="j">“Allow the little children, and don’t forbid them to come to
me; for the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to ones like these.”</span>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(19,15);</script>He laid his hands on
them, and departed from there.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,16);</script>Behold, one came to
him and said, “Good teacher, what good thing shall I do, that I may have
eternal life?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,17);</script>He said to him, <span
class="j">“<a href="#N87">Why do you call me good?</a> No one is good
but one, that is, God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the
commandments.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,18);</script>He said to him,
“Which ones?”
<p>Jesus said, <span class="j">“‘You shall not murder.’ ‘You shall
not commit adultery.’ ‘You shall not steal.’ ‘You shall not offer
false testimony.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(19,19);</script>‘Honor your father and
mother.’<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N88">*</a></sup></font> And, ‘You shall love your neighbor as
yourself.’”</span><font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N89">*</a></sup></font>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,20);</script>The young man said to
him, “All these things I have observed from my youth. What do I still
lack?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,21);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have, and
give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow
me.”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,22);</script>But when
the young man heard the saying, he went away sad, for he was one who had
great possessions. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,23);</script>Jesus
said to his disciples, <span class="j">“Most certainly I say to you, a
rich man will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven with difficulty. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(19,24);</script>Again I tell you, it is easier
for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter
into the Kingdom of God.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,25);</script>When the disciples
heard it, they were exceedingly astonished, saying, “Who then can be
saved?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,26);</script>Looking at them,
Jesus said, <span class="j">“With men this is impossible, but with God
all things are possible.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,27);</script>Then Peter answered,
“Behold, we have left everything, and followed you. What then will we
have?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,28);</script>Jesus said to them,
<span class="j">“Most certainly I tell you that you who have followed
me, in the regeneration when the Son of Man will sit on the throne of his
glory, you also will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of
Israel. <script type="text/javascript">cj(19,29);</script>Everyone who has
left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or
children, or lands, for my name’s sake, will receive one hundred times,
and will inherit eternal life. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(19,30);</script>But many will be last who are
first; and first who are last.</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,1);</script><span class="j">“For
the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who was the master of a household, who
went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(20,2);</script>When he had agreed with the
laborers for a <a href="#N90">denarius</a> a day, he sent them into his
vineyard. <script type="text/javascript">cj(20,3);</script>He went out
about the <a href="#N91">third hour,</a> and saw others standing idle in
the marketplace. <script type="text/javascript">cj(20,4);</script>To them
he said, ‘You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will
give you.’ So they went their way. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(20,5);</script>Again he went out about the <a
href="#N92">sixth and the ninth hour,</a> and did likewise. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(20,6);</script>About the <a href="#N93">eleventh
hour</a> he went out, and found others standing idle. He said to them,
‘Why do you stand here all day idle?’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(20,7);</script>“They said to him, ‘Because
no one has hired us.’
</span><p><span class="j">“He said to them, ‘You also go into the
vineyard, and you will receive whatever is right.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(20,8);</script>When evening had come, the lord
of the vineyard said to his manager, ‘Call the laborers and pay them
their wages, beginning from the last to the first.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(20,9);</script>“When those who were hired at
about the eleventh hour came, they each received a denarius. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(20,10);</script>When the first came, they
supposed that they would receive more; and they likewise each received a
denarius. <script type="text/javascript">cj(20,11);</script>When they
received it, they murmured against the master of the household, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(20,12);</script>saying, ‘These last have spent
one hour, and you have made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of
the day and the scorching heat!’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(20,13);</script>“But he answered one of them,
‘Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Didn’t you agree with me for a
denarius? <script type="text/javascript">cj(20,14);</script>Take that
which is yours, and go your way. It is my desire to give to this last just
as much as to you. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(20,15);</script>Isn’t it lawful for me to do
what I want to with what I own? Or is your eye evil, because I am good?’
<script type="text/javascript">cj(20,16);</script>So the last will be
first, and the first last. For many are called, but few are
chosen.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,17);</script>As Jesus was going up
to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside, and on the way he said
to them, <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,18);</script><span
class="j">“Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will
be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him
to death, <script type="text/javascript">cj(20,19);</script>and will hand
him over to the Gentiles to mock, to scourge, and to crucify; and the
third day he will be raised up.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,20);</script>Then the mother of
the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons, kneeling and asking a
certain thing of him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,21);</script>He
said to her, <span class="j">“What do you want?”</span>
<p>She said to him, “Command that these, my two sons, may sit, one on
your right hand, and one on your left hand, in your Kingdom.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,22);</script>But Jesus answered,
<span class="j">“You don’t know what you are asking. Are you able to
drink the cup that I am about to drink, and be baptized with the baptism
that I am baptized with?”</span>
<p>They said to him, “We are able.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,23);</script>He said to them,
<span class="j">“You will indeed drink my cup, and be baptized with the
baptism that I am baptized with, but to sit on my right hand and on my
left hand is not mine to give; but it is for whom it has been prepared by
my Father.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,24);</script>When the ten heard
it, they were indignant with the two brothers.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,25);</script>But Jesus summoned
them, and said, <span class="j">“You know that the rulers of the nations
lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(20,26);</script>It shall not be so among
you, but whoever desires to become great among you <a href="#N94">shall
be</a> your servant. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(20,27);</script>Whoever desires to be first
among you shall be your bondservant, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(20,28);</script>even as the Son of Man came not
to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for
many.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,29);</script>As they went out from
Jericho, a great multitude followed him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,30);</script>Behold, two blind men sitting by
the road, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, “Lord,
have mercy on us, you son of David!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,31);</script>The multitude rebuked them,
telling them that they should be quiet, but they cried out even more,
“Lord, have mercy on us, you son of David!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,32);</script>Jesus stood still,
and called them, and asked, <span class="j">“What do you want me to do
for you?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,33);</script>They told him,
“Lord, that our eyes may be opened.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,34);</script>Jesus, being moved
with compassion, touched their eyes; and immediately their eyes received
their sight, and they followed him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,1);</script>When they drew near to
Jerusalem, and came to <a href="#N95">Bethsphage,</a> to the Mount of

will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Untie them, and bring them

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,6);</script>The disciples went,

colt, and laid their clothes on them; and he sat on them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,8);</script>A very great multitude spread
their clothes on the road. Others cut branches from the trees, and spread
them on the road. <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,9);</script>The
multitudes who went before him, and who followed kept shouting, “<a

the prophet, Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,12);</script>Jesus entered into
the temple of God, and drove out all of those who sold and bought in the
temple, and overthrew the money changers’ tables and the seats of those
who sold the doves. <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,13);</script>He
said to them, <span class="j">“It is written, ‘My house shall be

they were indignant, <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,16);</script>and
said to him, “Do you hear what these are saying?”

marveled, saying, “How did the fig tree immediately wither away?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,21);</script>Jesus answered them,
<span class="j">“Most certainly I tell you, if you have faith, and
don’t doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but
even if you told this mountain, ‘Be taken up and cast into the sea,’

I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things. <script

he will ask us, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’ <script

we fear the multitude, for all hold John as a prophet.” <script

“We don’t know.”
<p>He also said to them, <span class="j">“Neither will I tell you by

two sons, and he came to the first, and said, ‘Son, go work today in my
vineyard.’ <script type="text/javascript">cj(21,29);</script>He
answered, ‘I will not,’ but afterward he changed his mind, and went.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(21,30);</script>He came to the second,

drew near, he sent his servants to the farmers, to receive his fruit.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(21,35);</script>The farmers took his

his son, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’ <script

the son, said among themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill
him, and seize his inheritance.’ <script

sought to seize him, they feared the multitudes, because they considered
him to be a prophet.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,1);</script>Jesus answered and
spoke again in parables to them, saying, <script

Heaven is like a certain king, who made a marriage feast for his son,

come. <script type="text/javascript">cj(22,4);</script>Again he sent out

went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his merchandise, <script

servants, and treated them shamefully, and killed them. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(22,7);</script>When the king heard that, he was
angry, and sent his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned their
city.
</span><p><span class="j"><script

intersections of the highways, and as many as you may find, invite to the
marriage feast.’ <script type="text/javascript">cj(22,10);</script>Those
servants went out into the highways, and gathered together as many as they
found, both bad and good. The wedding was filled with guests. <script

the guests, he saw there a man who didn’t have on wedding clothing,
<script type="text/javascript">cj(22,12);</script>and he said to him,
‘Friend, how did you come in here not wearing wedding clothing?’ He
was speechless. <script type="text/javascript">cj(22,13);</script>Then the
king said to the servants, ‘Bind him hand and foot, take him away, and
throw him into the outer darkness; there is where the weeping and grinding
of teeth will be.’ <script type="text/javascript">cj(22,14);</script>For
many are called, but few chosen.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,15);</script>Then the Pharisees
went and took counsel how they might entrap him in his talk. <script

him, along with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are
honest, and teach the way of God in truth, no matter whom you teach, for
you aren’t partial to anyone. <script

think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?”

their wickedness, and said, <span class="j">“Why do you test me, you
hypocrites? <script type="text/javascript">cj(22,19);</script>Show me the
tax money.”</span>
<p>They brought to him a denarius.

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,21);</script>They said to him,
“Caesar’s.”

things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are
God’s.”</span>

they marveled, and left him, and went away.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,23);</script>On that day Sadducees
(those who say that there is no resurrection) came to him. They asked him,

Moses said, ‘If a man dies, having no children, his brother shall marry
his wife, and raise up seed for his brother.’ <script

brothers. The first married and died, and having no seed left his wife to
his brother. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,26);</script>In the same
way, the second also, and the third, to the seventh. <script

therefore, whose wife will she be of the seven? For they all had her.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,29);</script>But Jesus answered
them, <span class="j">“You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures, nor
the power of God. <script type="text/javascript">cj(22,30);</script>For in
the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are
like God’s angels in heaven. <script

of the dead, haven’t you read that which was spoken to you by God,

heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, gathered themselves together.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(22,35);</script>One of them, a lawyer,
asked him a question, testing him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,36);</script>“Teacher, which is the
greatest commandment in the law?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,37);</script>Jesus said to him,

do you think of the Christ? Whose son is he?”</span>
<p>They said to him, “Of David.”

five talents, to another two, to another one; to each according to his own

five talents went and traded with them, and made another five talents.

who got the two gained another two. <script

away and dug in the earth, and hid his lord’s money.
</span><p><span class="j"><script

lord of those servants came, and reconciled accounts with them. <script

reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(25,25);</script>I was afraid, and went
away and hid your talent in the earth. Behold, you have what is yours.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script

given, and he will have abundance, but from him who doesn’t have, even
that which he has will be taken away. <script

be gathered, and he will separate them one from another, as a shepherd
separates the sheep from the goats. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(25,33);</script>He will set the sheep on his
right hand, but the goats on the left. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(25,34);</script>Then the King will tell those on
his right hand, ‘Come, blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom
prepared for you from the foundation of the world; <script

me food to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave me drink. I was a stranger,
and you took me in. <script type="text/javascript">cj(25,36);</script>I

prison, and you came to me.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script

answer him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry, and feed you; or

stranger, and take you in; or naked, and clothe you? <script

prison, and come to you?’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(25,40);</script>“The King will answer them,
‘Most certainly I tell you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least
of these my <a href="#N122">brothers</a>, you did it to me.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(25,41);</script>Then he will say also to those
on the left hand, ‘Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire
which is prepared for the devil and his angels; <script
type="text/javascript">cj(25,42);</script>for I was hungry, and you
didn’t give me food to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink;
<script type="text/javascript">cj(25,43);</script>I was a stranger, and
you didn’t take me in; naked, and you didn’t clothe me; sick, and in
prison, and you didn’t visit me.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(25,44);</script>“Then they will also answer,
saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or
naked, or sick, or in prison, and didn’t help you?’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(25,45);</script>“Then he will answer them,
saying, ‘Most certainly I tell you, inasmuch as you didn’t do it to
one of the least of these, you didn’t do it to me.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(25,46);</script>These will go away into eternal
punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,1);</script>It happened, when
Jesus had finished all these words, that he said to his disciples, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,2);</script><span class="j">“You know that
after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be
delivered up to be crucified.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,3);</script>Then the chief
priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people were gathered together
in the court of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,4);</script>They took counsel together that
they might take Jesus by deceit, and kill him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,5);</script>But they said, “Not during the
feast, lest a riot occur among the people.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,6);</script>Now when Jesus was in
Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,7);</script>a woman came to him having an
alabaster jar of very expensive ointment, and she poured it on his head as
he sat at the table. <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,8);</script>But
when his disciples saw this, they were indignant, saying, “Why this
waste? <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,9);</script>For this ointment
might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,10);</script>However, knowing
this, Jesus said to them, <span class="j">“Why do you trouble the woman?
Because she has done a good work for me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(26,11);</script>For you always have the poor
with you; but you don’t always have me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(26,12);</script>For in pouring this ointment on
my body, she did it to prepare me for burial. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(26,13);</script>Most certainly I tell you,
wherever this Good News is preached in the whole world, what this woman
has done will also be spoken of as a memorial of her.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,14);</script>Then one of the
twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,15);</script>and said, “What are you
willing to give me, that I should deliver him to you?” They weighed out
for him thirty pieces of silver. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,16);</script>From that time he sought
opportunity to betray him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,17);</script>Now on the first day
of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying to him, “Where
do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,18);</script>He said, <span
class="j">“Go into the city to a certain person, and tell him, ‘The
Teacher says, “My time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your
house with my disciples.”’”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,19);</script>The disciples did as
Jesus commanded them, and they prepared the Passover. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,20);</script>Now when evening had come, he
was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,21);</script>As they were eating, he said,
<span class="j">“Most certainly I tell you that one of you will betray
me.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,22);</script>They were exceedingly
sorrowful, and each began to ask him, “It isn’t me, is it, Lord?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,23);</script>He answered, <span
class="j">“He who dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same will
betray me. <script type="text/javascript">cj(26,24);</script>The Son of
Man goes, even as it is written of him, but woe to that man through whom
the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not
been born.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,25);</script>Judas, who betrayed
him, answered, “It isn’t me, is it, Rabbi?”
<p>He said to him, <span class="j">“You said it.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,26);</script>As they were eating,
Jesus took bread, <a href="#N123">gave thanks for</a> it, and broke it. He
gave to the disciples, and said, <span class="j">“Take, eat; this is my
body.”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,27);</script>He took
the cup, gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, <span class="j">“All of
you drink it, <script type="text/javascript">cj(26,28);</script>for this
is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the
remission of sins. <script type="text/javascript">cj(26,29);</script>But I
tell you that I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on,
until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father’s
Kingdom.”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,30);</script>When
they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,31);</script>Then Jesus said to
them, <span class="j">“All of you will be made to stumble because of me
tonight, for it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep
of the flock will be scattered.’<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a

type="text/javascript">cj(26,32);</script>But after I am raised up, I will
go before you into Galilee.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,33);</script>But Peter answered
him, “Even if all will be made to stumble because of you, I will never
be made to stumble.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,34);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“Most certainly I tell you that tonight, before the
rooster crows, you will deny me three times.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,35);</script>Peter said to him,
“Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you.” All of the
disciples also said likewise.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,36);</script>Then Jesus came with
them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to his disciples, <span
class="j">“Sit here, while I go there and pray.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,37);</script>He took with him Peter and the
two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and severely troubled.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(26,38);</script>Then he said to them,
<span class="j">“My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay
here, and watch with me.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,39);</script>He went forward a
little, fell on his face, and prayed, saying, <span class="j">“My
Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me; nevertheless,
not what I desire, but what you desire.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,40);</script>He came to the
disciples, and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, <span
class="j">“What, couldn’t you watch with me for one hour? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(26,41);</script>Watch and pray, that you don’t
enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is
weak.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,42);</script>Again, a second time
he went away, and prayed, saying, <span class="j">“My Father, if this
cup can’t pass away from me unless I drink it, your desire be
done.”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,43);</script>He came
again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,44);</script>He left them again, went away,
and prayed a third time, saying the same words. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,45);</script>Then he came to his disciples,
and said to them, <span class="j">“Sleep on now, and take your rest.
Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands
of sinners. <script type="text/javascript">cj(26,46);</script>Arise,
let’s be going. Behold, he who betrays me is at hand.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,47);</script>While he was still
speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great
multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priest and elders of the
people. <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,48);</script>Now he who
betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, “Whoever I kiss, he is the one.
Seize him.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,49);</script>Immediately he came to Jesus,
and said, “Hail, Rabbi!” and kissed him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,50);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“Friend, why are you here?”</span> Then they came and
laid hands on Jesus, and took him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,51);</script>Behold, one of those who were
with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck the
servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,52);</script>Then Jesus said to him, <span
class="j">“Put your sword back into its place, for all those who take
the sword will die by the sword. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(26,53);</script>Or do you think that I
couldn’t ask my Father, and he would even now send me more than twelve
legions of angels? <script type="text/javascript">cj(26,54);</script>How
then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that it must be so?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,55);</script>In that hour Jesus
said to the multitudes, <span class="j">“Have you come out as against a
robber with swords and clubs to seize me? I sat daily in the temple
teaching, and you didn’t arrest me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(26,56);</script>But all this has happened, that
the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.”</span>
<p>Then all the disciples left him, and fled. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,57);</script>Those who had taken Jesus led
him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders
were gathered together. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,58);</script>But Peter followed him from a
distance, to the court of the high priest, and entered in and sat with the
officers, to see the end. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,59);</script>Now the chief priests, the
elders, and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus, that
they might put him to death; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,60);</script>and they found none. Even though
many false witnesses came forward, they found none. But at last two false
witnesses came forward, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,61);</script>and said, “This man said, ‘I
am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,62);</script>The high priest stood
up, and said to him, “Have you no answer? What is this that these
testify against you?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,63);</script>But Jesus held his peace. The
high priest answered him, “I adjure you by the living God, that you tell
us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,64);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“You have said it. Nevertheless, I tell you, after this
you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming
on the clouds of the sky.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,65);</script>Then the high priest
tore his clothing, saying, “He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any
more witnesses? Behold, now you have heard his blasphemy. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,66);</script>What do you think?”
<p>They answered, “He is worthy of death!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,67);</script>Then they spit in his face and
beat him with their fists, and some slapped him, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,68);</script>saying, “Prophesy to us, you
Christ! Who hit you?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,69);</script>Now Peter was sitting
outside in the court, and a maid came to him, saying, “You were also
with Jesus, the Galilean!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,70);</script>But he denied it
before them all, saying, “I don’t know what you are talking about.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,71);</script>When he had gone out
onto the porch, someone else saw him, and said to those who were there,
“This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,72);</script>Again he denied it
with an oath, “I don’t know the man.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,73);</script>After a little while
those who stood by came and said to Peter, “Surely you are also one of
them, for your speech makes you known.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,74);</script>Then he began to
curse and to swear, “I don’t know the man!”
<p>Immediately the rooster crowed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,75);</script>Peter remembered the word which
Jesus had said to him, “Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three
times.” He went out and wept bitterly.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,1);</script>Now when morning had
come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel
against Jesus to put him to death: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,2);</script>and they bound him, and led him
away, and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate, the governor. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,3);</script>Then Judas, who betrayed him,
when he saw that Jesus was condemned, felt remorse, and brought back the
thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,4);</script>saying, “I have sinned in that
I betrayed innocent blood.”
<p>But they said, “What is that to us? You see to it.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,5);</script>He threw down the
pieces of silver in the sanctuary, and departed. He went away and hanged
himself. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,6);</script>The chief
priests took the pieces of silver, and said, “It’s not lawful to put
them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,7);</script>They took counsel, and bought the
potter’s field with them, to bury strangers in. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,8);</script>Therefore that field was called
“The Field of Blood” to this day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,9);</script>Then that which was spoken
through <a href="#N125">Jeremiah</a> the prophet was fulfilled, saying,
<dl>
<dt>“They took the thirty pieces of silver,
<dd>the price of him upon whom a price had been set,
<dd>whom some of the children of Israel priced,
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,10);</script>and they gave them
for the potter’s field,
<dd>as the Lord commanded me.”<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N126">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,11);</script>Now Jesus stood
before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, “Are you the
King of the Jews?”
<p>Jesus said to him, <span class="j">“So you say.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,12);</script>When he was accused
by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,13);</script>Then Pilate said to him,
“Don’t you hear how many things they testify against you?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,14);</script>He gave him no
answer, not even one word, so that the governor marveled greatly. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,15);</script>Now at the feast the governor
was accustomed to release to the multitude one prisoner, whom they
desired. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,16);</script>They had then a
notable prisoner, called Barabbas. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,17);</script>When therefore they were
gathered together, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release
to you? Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called Christ?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,18);</script>For he knew that because of envy
they had delivered him up.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,19);</script>While he was sitting
on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, “Have nothing to do
with that righteous man, for I have suffered many things this day in a
dream because of him.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,20);</script>Now the chief priests and the
elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(27,21);</script>But the governor
answered them, “Which of the two do you want me to release to you?”
<p>They said, “Barabbas!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,22);</script>Pilate said to them,
“What then shall I do to Jesus, who is called Christ?”
<p>They all said to him, “Let him be crucified!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,23);</script>But the governor
said, “Why? What evil has he done?”
<p>But they cried out exceedingly, saying, “Let him be crucified!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,24);</script>So when Pilate saw
that nothing was being gained, but rather that a disturbance was starting,
he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, “I am
innocent of the blood of this righteous person. You see to it.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,25);</script>All the people
answered, “May his blood be on us, and on our children!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,26);</script>Then he released to
them Barabbas, but Jesus he flogged and delivered to be crucified. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,27);</script>Then the governor’s soldiers
took Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered the whole garrison together
against him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,28);</script>They
stripped him, and put a scarlet robe on him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,29);</script>They braided a crown of thorns
and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled
down before him, and mocked him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(27,30);</script>They spat on him, and
took the reed and struck him on the head. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,31);</script>When they had mocked him, they
took the robe off of him, and put his clothes on him, and led him away to
crucify him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,32);</script>As they came out,
they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, and they compelled him to go
with them, that he might carry his cross. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,33);</script>They came to a place called
“Golgotha,” that is to say, “The place of a skull.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,34);</script>They gave him sour wine to drink
mixed with gall. When he had tasted it, he would not drink. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,35);</script>When they had crucified him,
they divided his clothing among them, casting lots,<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N127">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,36);</script>and they sat and watched him
there. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,37);</script>They set up over
his head the accusation against him written, “THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF
THE JEWS.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,38);</script>Then there were two
robbers crucified with him, one on his right hand and one on the left.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(27,39);</script>Those who passed by
blasphemed him, wagging their heads, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,40);</script>and saying, “You who destroy
the temple, and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son
of God, come down from the cross!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,41);</script>Likewise the chief
priests also mocking, with the scribes, <a href="#N128">the Pharisees,</a>
and the elders, said, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,42);</script>“He saved others, but he
can’t save himself. If he is the King of Israel, let him come down from
the cross now, and we will believe in him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,43);</script>He trusts in God. Let God
deliver him now, if he wants him; for he said, ‘I am the Son of
God.’” <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,44);</script>The robbers
also who were crucified with him cast on him the same reproach.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,45);</script>Now from the <a
href="#N129">sixth hour</a> there was darkness over all the land until the
<a href="#N130">ninth hour.</a> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,46);</script>About the ninth hour Jesus cried
with a loud voice, saying, <span class="j">“Eli, Eli, <a
href="#N131">lima</a> sabachthani?”</span> That is, <span
class="j">“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”</span><font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N132">*</a></sup></font>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,47);</script>Some of them who
stood there, when they heard it, said, “This man is calling Elijah.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,48);</script>Immediately one of
them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a
reed, and gave him a drink. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,49);</script>The rest said, “Let him be.
Let’s see whether Elijah comes to save him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,50);</script>Jesus cried again
with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,51);</script>Behold, the veil of the temple
was torn in two from the top to the bottom. The earth quaked and the rocks
were split. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,52);</script>The tombs
were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were
raised; <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,53);</script>and coming out
of the tombs after his resurrection, they entered into the holy city and
appeared to many. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,54);</script>Now
the centurion, and those who were with him watching Jesus, when they saw
the earthquake, and the things that were done, feared exceedingly, saying,
“Truly this was the Son of God.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,55);</script>Many women were there
watching from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(27,56);</script>Among them were Mary
Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons
of Zebedee. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,57);</script>When evening
had come, a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who himself was also
Jesus’ disciple came. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,58);</script>This man went to Pilate, and
asked for Jesus’ body. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given up.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(27,59);</script>Joseph took the body,
and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,60);</script>and laid it in his own new tomb,
which he had cut out in the rock, and he rolled a great stone to the door
of the tomb, and departed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,61);</script>Mary Magdalene was there, and
the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,62);</script>Now on the next day, which was
the day after the Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees
were gathered together to Pilate, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,63);</script>saying, “Sir, we remember what
that deceiver said while he was still alive: ‘After three days I will
rise again.’ <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,64);</script>Command
therefore that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest perhaps
his disciples come at night and steal him away, and tell the people, ‘He
is risen from the dead;’ and the last deception will be worse than the
first.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,65);</script>Pilate said to them,
“You have a guard. Go, make it as secure as you can.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,66);</script>So they went with the guard and
made the tomb secure, sealing the stone.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,1);</script>Now after the Sabbath,
as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the
other Mary came to see the tomb. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,2);</script>Behold, there was a great
earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky, and came and
rolled away the stone from the door, and sat on it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,3);</script>His appearance was like
lightning, and his clothing white as snow. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,4);</script>For fear of him, the guards
shook, and became like dead men. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,5);</script>The angel answered the women,
“Don’t be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus, who has been
crucified. <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,6);</script>He is not
here, for he has risen, just like he said. Come, see the place where the
Lord was lying. <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,7);</script>Go
quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead, and behold,
he goes before you into Galilee; there you will see him.’ Behold, I have
told you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,8);</script>They departed quickly
from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples
word. <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,9);</script>As they went to
tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, <span
class="j">“Rejoice!”</span>
<p>They came and took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,10);</script>Then Jesus said to
them, <span class="j">“Don’t be afraid. Go tell my <a
href="#N133">brothers</a> that they should go into Galilee, and there they
will see me.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,11);</script>Now while they were
going, behold, some of the guards came into the city, and told the chief
priests all the things that had happened. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,12);</script>When they were assembled with
the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave a large amount of silver to
the soldiers, <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,13);</script>saying,
“Say that his disciples came by night, and stole him away while we
slept. <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,14);</script>If this comes to
the governor’s ears, we will persuade him and make you free of worry.”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(28,15);</script>So they took the money
and did as they were told. This saying was spread abroad among the Jews,
and continues until this day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,16);</script>But the eleven
disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had sent them.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(28,17);</script>When they saw him, they
bowed down to him, but some doubted. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,18);</script>Jesus came to them and spoke to
them, saying, <span class="j">“All authority has been given to me in
heaven and on earth. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(28,19);</script>Go,<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N134">*</a></sup></font> and make disciples of all
nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of
the Holy Spirit, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(28,20);</script>teaching them to observe all
things that I commanded you. Behold, I am with you always, even to the end
of the age.”</span> Amen.

The Good News According to Luke
</h1><p>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,1);</script>Since many have undertaken
to set in order a narrative concerning those matters which have been
fulfilled among us, <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,2);</script>even
as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word
delivered them to us, <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,3);</script>it
seemed good to me also, having traced the course of all things accurately
from the first, to write to you in order, most excellent Theophilus;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,4);</script>that you might know the
certainty concerning the things in which you were instructed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,5);</script>There was in the days
of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the
priestly division of Abijah. He had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and
her name was Elizabeth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,6);</script>They were both righteous before
God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and ordinances of the
Lord. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,7);</script>But they had no
child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they both were well advanced in
years. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,8);</script>Now it happened,
while he executed the priest’s office before God in the order of his
division, <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,9);</script>according to the
custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to enter into the temple of
the Lord and burn incense. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,10);</script>The whole multitude of the people
were praying outside at the hour of incense.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,11);</script>An angel of the Lord
appeared to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,12);</script>Zacharias was troubled
when he saw him, and fear fell upon him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,13);</script>But the angel said to him,
“Don’t be afraid, Zacharias, because your request has been heard, and
your wife, Elizabeth, will bear you a son, and you shall call his name
John. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,14);</script>You will have joy
and gladness; and many will rejoice at his birth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,15);</script>For he will be great in the sight
of the Lord, and he will drink no wine nor strong drink. He will be filled
with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,16);</script>He will turn many of the children
of Israel to the Lord, their God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,17);</script>He will go before him in the
spirit and power of Elijah, ‘to turn the hearts of the fathers to the
children,’ and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to prepare a
people prepared for the Lord.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,18);</script>Zacharias said to the
angel, “How can I be sure of this? For I am an old man, and my wife is
well advanced in years.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,19);</script>The angel answered
him, “I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God. I was sent to
speak to you, and to bring you this good news. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,20);</script>Behold, you will be silent and
not able to speak, until the day that these things will happen, because
you didn’t believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their proper
time.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,21);</script>The people were
waiting for Zacharias, and they marveled that he delayed in the temple.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,22);</script>When he came out, he
could not speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision in
the temple. He continued making signs to them, and remained mute. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,23);</script>It happened, when the days of his
service were fulfilled, he departed to his house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,24);</script>After these days Elizabeth, his
wife, conceived, and she hid herself five months, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,25);</script>“Thus has the Lord done to me
in the days in which he looked at me, to take away my reproach among
men.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,26);</script>Now in the sixth
month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee, named
Nazareth, <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,27);</script>to a virgin
pledged to be married to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of
David. The virgin’s name was Mary. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,28);</script>Having come in, the angel said to
her, “Rejoice, you highly favored one! The Lord is with you. Blessed are
you among women!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,29);</script>But when she saw him,
she was greatly troubled at the saying, and considered what kind of
salutation this might be. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,30);</script>The angel said to her, “Don’t
be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,31);</script>Behold, you will conceive in your
womb, and bring forth a son, and will call his name ‘Jesus.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,32);</script>He will be great, and will be
called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of
his father, David, <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,33);</script>and he
will reign over the house of Jacob forever. There will be no end to his
Kingdom.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,34);</script>Mary said to the
angel, “How can this be, seeing I am a virgin?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,35);</script>The angel answered
her, “The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High
will overshadow you. Therefore also the holy one who is born from you will
be called the Son of God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,36);</script>Behold, Elizabeth, your relative,
also has conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with
her who was called barren. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,37);</script>For everything spoken by God is
possible.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,38);</script>Mary said, “Behold,
the handmaid of the Lord; be it to me according to your word.”
<p>The angel departed from her. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,39);</script>Mary arose in those days and went
into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,40);</script>and entered into the house of
Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,41);</script>It happened, when Elizabeth heard
Mary’s greeting, that the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was
filled with the Holy Spirit. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,42);</script>She called out with a loud voice,
and said, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your
womb! <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,43);</script>Why am I so
favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,44);</script>For behold, when the voice of
your greeting came into my ears, the baby leaped in my womb for joy!
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,45);</script>Blessed is she who
believed, for there will be a fulfillment of the things which have been
spoken to her from the Lord!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,46);</script>Mary said,
<dl>
<dt>“My soul magnifies the Lord.
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,47);</script>My spirit has
rejoiced in God my Savior,
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,48);</script>for he has looked at
the humble state of his handmaid.
<dt>For behold, from now on, all generations will call me blessed.
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,49);</script>For he who is mighty
has done great things for me.
<dd>Holy is his name.
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,50);</script>His mercy is for
generations of generations on those who fear him.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,51);</script>He has shown strength
with his arm.
<dd>He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,52);</script>He has put down
princes from their thrones.
<dd>And has exalted the lowly.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,53);</script>He has filled the
hungry with good things.
<dd>He has sent the rich away empty.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,54);</script>He has given help to
Israel, his servant, that he might remember mercy,
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,55);</script>As he spoke to our
fathers,
<dd>to Abraham and his seed forever.”

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,56);</script>Mary stayed with her
about three months, and then returned to her house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,57);</script>Now the time that Elizabeth
should give birth was fulfilled, and she brought forth a son. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,58);</script>Her neighbors and her relatives
heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy towards her, and they rejoiced
with her. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,59);</script>It happened on
the eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child; and they would
have called him Zacharias, after the name of the father. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,60);</script>His mother answered, “Not so;
but he will be called John.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,61);</script>They said to her,
“There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name.”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,62);</script>They made signs to his
father, what he would have him called.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,63);</script>He asked for a writing
tablet, and wrote, “His name is John.”
<p>They all marveled. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,64);</script>His
mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue freed, and he spoke, blessing
God. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,65);</script>Fear came on all who
lived around them, and all these sayings were talked about throughout all
the hill country of Judea. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,66);</script>All who heard them laid them up
in their heart, saying, “What then will this child be?” The hand of
the Lord was with him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,67);</script>His father, Zacharias, was filled
with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,
<dl>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,68);</script>“Blessed be the
Lord, the God of Israel,

our fathers,

<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,73);</script>the oath which he
spoke to Abraham, our father,
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,74);</script>to grant to us that
we, being delivered out of the hand of our enemies,
<dd>should serve him without fear,
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,75);</script>In holiness and
righteousness before him all the days of our life.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,76);</script>And you, child, will
be called a prophet of the Most High,

<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,77);</script>to give knowledge of
salvation to his people by the remission of their sins,

mercy of our God,

</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,80);</script>The child was growing,
and becoming strong in spirit, and was in the desert until the day of his
public appearance to Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,1);</script>Now it happened in
those days, that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world
should be enrolled. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,2);</script>This
was the first enrollment made when Quirinius was governor of Syria.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,3);</script>All went to enroll
themselves, everyone to his own city. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,4);</script>Joseph also went up from Galilee,
out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of David, which is
called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,5);</script>to enroll himself with Mary, who
was pledged to be married to him as wife, being pregnant.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,6);</script>It happened, while they
were there, that the day had come that she should give birth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,7);</script>She brought forth her firstborn
son, and she wrapped him in bands of cloth, and laid him in a feeding
trough, because there was no room for them in the inn. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,8);</script>There were shepherds in the same
country staying in the field, and keeping watch by night over their flock.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,9);</script>Behold, an angel of the
Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they
were terrified. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,10);</script>The angel
said to them, “Don’t be afraid, for behold, I bring you good news of
great joy which will be to all the people. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,11);</script>For there is born to you, this
day, in the city of David, a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,12);</script>This is the sign to you: you will
find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth, lying in a feeding trough.”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,13);</script>Suddenly, there was with
the angel a multitude of the heavenly army praising God, and saying,
<dl>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,14);</script>“Glory to God in
the highest,
<dd>on earth peace, good will toward men.”
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,15);</script>It happened, when the
angels went away from them into the sky, that the shepherds said one to
another, “Let’s go to Bethlehem, now, and see this thing that has
happened, which the Lord has made known to us.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,16);</script>They came with haste, and found
both Mary and Joseph, and the baby was lying in the feeding trough.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,17);</script>When they saw it, they
publicized widely the saying which was spoken to them about this child.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,18);</script>All who heard it wondered
at the things which were spoken to them by the shepherds. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,19);</script>But Mary kept all these sayings,
pondering them in her heart. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,20);</script>The shepherds returned,
glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and
seen, just as it was told them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,21);</script>When eight days were
fulfilled for the circumcision of the child, his name was called Jesus,
which was given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,22);</script>When the days of their
purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought
him up to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,23);</script>(as it is written in the law of
the Lord, “Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the
Lord”),<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N1">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,24);</script>and to offer a sacrifice
according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, “A pair of
turtledoves, or two young pigeons.”<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N2">*</a></sup></font>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,25);</script>Behold, there was a
man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. This man was righteous and devout,
looking for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was on him.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,26);</script>It had been revealed to
him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the
Lord’s <a href="#N3">Christ.</a> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,27);</script>He came in the Spirit into the
temple. When the parents brought in the child, Jesus, that they might do
concerning him according to the custom of the law, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,28);</script>then he received him into his
arms, and blessed God, and said,
<dl>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,29);</script>“Now you are
releasing your servant, Master,
<dd>according to your word, in peace;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,30);</script>for my eyes have seen
your salvation,
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,31);</script>which you have
prepared before the face of all peoples;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,32);</script>a light for
revelation to the nations,
<dd>and the glory of your people Israel.”
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,33);</script>Joseph and his mother
were marveling at the things which were spoken concerning him, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,34);</script>and Simeon blessed them, and said
to Mary, his mother, “Behold, this child is set for the falling and the
rising of many in Israel, and for a sign which is spoken against. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,35);</script>Yes, a sword will pierce through
your own soul, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,36);</script>There was one Anna, a
prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher (she was of a
great age, having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,37);</script>and she had been a widow
for about eighty-four years), who didn’t depart from the temple,
worshipping with fastings and petitions night and day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,38);</script>Coming up at that very hour, she
gave thanks to the Lord, and spoke of him to all those who were looking
for redemption in Jerusalem.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,39);</script>When they had
accomplished all things that were according to the law of the Lord, they
returned into Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,40);</script>The child was growing, and was
becoming strong in spirit, being filled with wisdom, and the grace of God
was upon him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,41);</script>His parents
went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,42);</script>When he was twelve
years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,43);</script>and when they had
fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in
Jerusalem. Joseph and his mother didn’t know it, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,44);</script>but supposing him to be in the
company, they went a day’s journey, and they looked for him among their
relatives and acquaintances. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,45);</script>When they didn’t find him, they
returned to Jerusalem, looking for him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,46);</script>It happened after three days they
found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both
listening to them, and asking them questions. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,47);</script>All who heard him were amazed at
his understanding and his answers. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,48);</script>When they saw him, they were
astonished, and his mother said to him, “Son, why have you treated us
this way? Behold, your father and I were anxiously looking for you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,49);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Why were you looking for me? Didn’t you know that I must be
in my Father’s house?”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,50);</script>They didn’t understand the
saying which he spoke to them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,51);</script>And he went down with them, and
came to Nazareth. He was subject to them, and his mother kept all these
sayings in her heart. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,52);</script>And
Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,1);</script>Now in the fifteenth
year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of
Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip
tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch
of Abilene, <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,2);</script>in the high
priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John, the son of
Zacharias, in the wilderness. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,3);</script>He came into all the region around
the Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for remission of sins.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,4);</script>As it is written in the
book of the words of Isaiah the prophet,
<dl>
<dt>“The voice of one crying in the wilderness,
<dd>‘Make ready the way of the Lord.
<dt>Make his paths straight.
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,5);</script>Every valley will be
filled.
<dt>Every mountain and hill will be brought low.
<dd>The crooked will become straight,
<dd>and the rough ways smooth.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,6);</script>All flesh will see
God’s salvation.’”<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N4">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,7);</script>He said therefore to
the multitudes who went out to be baptized by him, “You offspring of
vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,8);</script>Bring forth therefore fruits
worthy of repentance, and don’t begin to say among yourselves, ‘We
have Abraham for our father;’ for I tell you that God is able to raise
up children to Abraham from these stones! <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,9);</script>Even now the axe also lies at the
root of the trees. Every tree therefore that doesn’t bring forth good
fruit is cut down, and thrown into the fire.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,10);</script>The multitudes asked
him, “What then must we do?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,11);</script>He answered them,
“He who has two coats, let him give to him who has none. He who has
food, let him do likewise.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,12);</script>Tax collectors also
came to be baptized, and they said to him, “Teacher, what must we do?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,13);</script>He said to them,
“Collect no more than that which is appointed to you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,14);</script>Soldiers also asked
him, saying, “What about us? What must we do?”
<p>He said to them, “Extort from no one by violence, neither accuse
anyone wrongfully. Be content with your wages.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,15);</script>As the people were in
expectation, and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning John, whether
perhaps he was the Christ, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,16);</script>John answered them all, “I
indeed baptize you with water, but he comes who is mightier than I, the
latchet of whose sandals I am not worthy to loosen. He will baptize you in
the Holy Spirit and fire, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,17);</script>whose fan is in his hand, and he
will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor, and will gather the wheat
into his barn; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,18);</script>Then with many other
exhortations he preached good news to the people, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,19);</script>but Herod the tetrarch, being
reproved by him for Herodias, his <a href="#N5">brother’s</a> wife, and
for all the evil things which Herod had done, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,20);</script>added this also to them all, that
he shut up John in prison. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,21);</script>Now it happened, when all the
people were baptized, Jesus also had been baptized, and was praying. The
sky was opened, <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,22);</script>and the
Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form as a dove on him; and a voice came
out of the sky, saying “You are my beloved Son. In you I am well
pleased.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,23);</script>Jesus himself, when he
began to teach, was about thirty years old, being the son (as was

Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the
wilderness <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,2);</script>for forty days,
being tempted by the devil. He ate nothing in those days. Afterward, when
they were completed, he was hungry. <script

are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.”

before me, it will all be yours.”

taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.

synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read. <script

him, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth,

yourself! Whatever we have heard done at Capernaum, do also here in your

said, <span class="j">“Most certainly I tell you, no prophet is
acceptable in his hometown. <script

many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut up
three years and six months, when a great famine came over all the land.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(4,26);</script>Elijah was sent to none
of them, except to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a
widow. <script type="text/javascript">cj(4,27);</script>There were many

the city, and led him to the brow of the hill that their city was built
on, that they might throw him off the cliff. <script

midst, went his way.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,31);</script>He came down to
Capernaum, a city of Galilee. He was teaching them on the Sabbath day,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,32);</script>and they were astonished
at his teaching, for his word was with authority. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,33);</script>In the synagogue there was a man
who had a spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,34);</script>saying, “Ah! what have
we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know
you who you are: the Holy One of God!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,35);</script>Jesus rebuked him,
saying, <span class="j">“Be silent, and come out of him!”</span> When

done him no harm.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,36);</script>Amazement came on all,
and they spoke together, one with another, saying, “What is this word?
For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they
come out!” <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,37);</script>News about
him went out into every place of the surrounding region.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,38);</script>He rose up from the
synagogue, and entered into Simon’s house. Simon’s mother-in-law was
afflicted with a great fever, and they begged him for her. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,39);</script>He stood over her, and rebuked
the fever; and it left her. Immediately she rose up and served them.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,40);</script>When the sun was setting,
all those who had any sick with various diseases brought them to him; and
he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,41);</script>Demons also came out from many,
crying out, and saying, “You are the Christ, the Son of God!” Rebuking
them, he didn’t allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the
Christ.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,42);</script>When it was day, he
departed and went into an uninhabited place, and the multitudes looked for
him, and came to him, and held on to him, so that he wouldn’t go away
from them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,43);</script>But he said to
them, <span class="j">“I must preach the good news of the Kingdom of God
to the other cities also. For this reason I have been sent.”</span>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,44);</script>He was preaching in the
synagogues of Galilee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,1);</script>Now it happened, while
the multitude pressed on him and heard the word of God, that he was
standing by the lake of Gennesaret. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,2);</script>He saw two boats standing by the
lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them, and were washing their nets.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(5,3);</script>He entered into one of the
boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him to put out a little from the
land. He sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,4);</script>When he had finished speaking, he
said to Simon, <span class="j">“Put out into the deep, and let down your
nets for a catch.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,5);</script>Simon answered him,
“Master, we worked all night, and took nothing; but at your word I will
let down the net.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,6);</script>When
they had done this, they caught a great multitude of fish, and their net
was breaking. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,7);</script>They
beckoned to their partners in the other boat, that they should come and
help them. They came, and filled both boats, so that they began to sink.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(5,8);</script>But Simon Peter, when he
saw it, fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, “Depart from me, for I am a
sinful man, Lord.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,9);</script>For
he was amazed, and all who were with him, at the catch of fish which they
had caught; <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,10);</script>and so also
were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon.
<p>Jesus said to Simon, <span class="j">“Don’t be afraid. From now on
you will be catching people alive.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,11);</script>When they had brought
their boats to land, they left everything, and followed him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,12);</script>It happened, while he was in one
of the cities, behold, there was a man full of leprosy. When he saw Jesus,
he fell on his face, and begged him, saying, “Lord, if you want to, you
can make me clean.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,13);</script>He stretched out his
hand, and touched him, saying, <span class="j">“I want to. Be made
clean.”</span>
<p>Immediately the leprosy left him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,14);</script>He commanded him to tell no one,
<span class="j">“But go your way, and show yourself to the priest, and
offer for your cleansing according to what Moses commanded, for a
testimony to them.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,15);</script>But the report concerning him
spread much more, and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be
healed by him of their infirmities. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,16);</script>But he withdrew himself into the
desert, and prayed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,17);</script>It happened on one of
those days, that he was teaching; and there were Pharisees and teachers of
the law sitting by, who had come out of every village of Galilee, Judea,
and Jerusalem. The power of the Lord was with him to heal them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,18);</script>Behold, men brought a paralyzed
man on a cot, and they sought to bring him in to lay before Jesus. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,19);</script>Not finding a way to bring him in
because of the multitude, they went up to the housetop, and let him down
through the tiles with his cot into the midst before Jesus. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,20);</script>Seeing their faith, he said to
him, <span class="j">“Man, your sins are forgiven you.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,21);</script>The scribes and the
Pharisees began to reason, saying, “Who is this that speaks blasphemies?
Who can forgive sins, but God alone?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,22);</script>But Jesus, perceiving
their thoughts, answered them, <span class="j">“Why are you reasoning so
in your hearts? <script type="text/javascript">cj(5,23);</script>Which is
easier to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you;’ or to say, ‘Arise and
walk?’ <script type="text/javascript">cj(5,24);</script>But that you may
know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”</span>
(he said to the paralyzed man), <span class="j">“I tell you, arise, and
take up your cot, and go to your house.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,25);</script>Immediately he rose up
before them, and took up that which he was laying on, and departed to his
house, glorifying God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,26);</script>Amazement took hold on all, and
they glorified God. They were filled with fear, saying, “We have seen
strange things today.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,27);</script>After these things he
went out, and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax office,
and said to him, <span class="j">“Follow me!”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,28);</script>He left everything,
and rose up and followed him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,29);</script>Levi made a great feast for him
in his house. There was a great crowd of tax collectors and others who
were reclining with them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,30);</script>Their scribes and the Pharisees
murmured against his disciples, saying, “Why do you eat and drink with
the tax collectors and sinners?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,31);</script>Jesus answered them, <span
class="j">“Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those
who are sick do. <script type="text/javascript">cj(5,32);</script>I have
not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,33);</script>They said to him,
“Why do John’s disciples often fast and pray, likewise also the
disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,34);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast, while the
bridegroom is with them? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,35);</script>But the days will come when the
bridegroom will be taken away from them. Then they will fast in those
days.”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,36);</script>He also
told a parable to them. <span class="j">“No one puts a piece from a new
garment on an old garment, or else he will tear the new, and also the
piece from the new will not match the old. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,37);</script>No one puts new wine into old
wineskins, or else the new wine will burst the skins, and it will be
spilled, and the skins will be destroyed. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,38);</script>But new wine must be put into
fresh wineskins, and both are preserved. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,39);</script>No man having drunk old wine
immediately desires new, for he says, ‘The old is better.’”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,1);</script>Now it happened on the
second Sabbath after the first, that he was going through the grain
fields. His disciples plucked the heads of grain, and ate, rubbing them in
their hands. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,2);</script>But some of
the Pharisees said to them, “Why do you do that which is not lawful to
do on the Sabbath day?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,3);</script>Jesus, answering them,
said, <span class="j">“Haven’t you read what David did when he was
hungry, he, and those who were with him; <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,4);</script>how he entered into God’s house,
and took and ate the show bread, and gave also to those who were with him,
which is not lawful to eat except for the priests alone?”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,5);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,6);</script>It also happened on
another Sabbath that he entered into the synagogue and taught. There was a
man there, and his right hand was withered. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,7);</script>The scribes and the Pharisees
watched him, to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath, that they might
find an accusation against him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,8);</script>But he knew their thoughts; and he
said to the man who had the withered hand, <span class="j">“Rise up, and
stand in the middle.”</span> He arose and stood. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,9);</script>Then Jesus said to them, <span
class="j">“I will ask you something: Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do
good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to kill?”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,10);</script>He looked around at them all, and
said to the man, <span class="j">“Stretch out your hand.”</span> He
did, and his hand was restored as sound as the other. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,11);</script>But they were filled with rage,
and talked with one another about what they might do to Jesus.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,12);</script>It happened in these
days, that he went out to the mountain to pray, and he continued all night
in prayer to God. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,13);</script>When it
was day, he called his disciples, and from them he chose twelve, whom he
also named apostles: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,14);</script>Simon, whom he also named Peter;
Andrew, his brother; James; John; Philip; Bartholomew; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,15);</script>Matthew; Thomas; James, the son
of Alphaeus; Simon, who was called the Zealot; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,16);</script>Judas the son of James; and Judas
Iscariot, who also became a traitor. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,17);</script>He came down with them, and stood
on a level place, with a crowd of his disciples, and a great number of the
people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon,
who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,18);</script>as well as those who were
troubled by unclean spirits, and they were being healed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,19);</script>All the multitude sought to touch
him, for power came out from him and healed them all.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,20);</script>He lifted up his eyes
to his disciples, and said,
<dl>
<dt><span class="j">“Blessed are you who are poor,

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,39);</script>He spoke a parable to
them. <span class="j">“Can the blind guide the blind? Won’t they both
fall into a pit? <script type="text/javascript">cj(6,40);</script>A
disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone when he is fully trained

you tell your brother, ‘Brother, let me remove the speck of chaff that
is in your eye,’ when you yourself don’t see the beam that is in your

you can see clearly to remove the speck of chaff that is in your
brother’s eye. <script type="text/javascript">cj(6,43);</script>For
there is no good tree that brings forth rotten fruit; nor again a rotten
tree that brings forth good fruit. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,44);</script>For each tree is known by its own
fruit. For people don’t gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather
grapes from a bramble bush. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,45);</script>The good man out of the good
treasure of his heart brings out that which is good, and the evil man out
of the evil treasure of his heart brings out that which is evil, for out
of the abundance of the heart, his mouth speaks.
</span><p><span class="j"><script

hears my words, and does them, I will show you who he is like. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,48);</script>He is like a man building a
house, who dug and went deep, and laid a foundation on the rock. When a
flood arose, the stream broke against that house, and could not shake it,
because it was founded on the rock. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,49);</script>But he who hears, and doesn’t
do, is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation,
against which the stream broke, and immediately it fell, and the ruin of
that house was great.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,1);</script>After he had finished
speaking in the hearing of the people, he entered into Capernaum. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,2);</script>A certain centurion’s servant,
who was dear to him, was sick and at the point of death. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,3);</script>When he heard about Jesus, he sent
to him elders of the Jews, asking him to come and save his servant.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,4);</script>When they came to Jesus,
they begged him earnestly, saying, “He is worthy for you to do this for
him, <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,5);</script>for he loves our
nation, and he built our synagogue for us.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,6);</script>Jesus went with them. When he was
now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to
him, “Lord, don’t trouble yourself, for I am not worthy for you to
come under my roof. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,7);</script>Therefore I didn’t even think
myself worthy to come to you; but say the word, and my servant will be
healed. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,8);</script>For I also am a
man placed under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one,
‘Go!’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come!’ and he comes; and to my
servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,9);</script>When Jesus heard these
things, he marveled at him, and turned and said to the multitude who
followed him, <span class="j">“I tell you, I have not found such great
faith, no, not in Israel.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,10);</script>Those who were sent, returning to
the house, found that the servant who had been sick was well.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,11);</script>It happened soon
afterwards, that he went to a city called Nain. Many of his disciples,
along with a great multitude, went with him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,12);</script>Now when he drew near to the gate
of the city, behold, one who was dead was carried out, the only son of his
mother, and she was a widow. Many people of the city were with her.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,13);</script>When the Lord saw her, he
had compassion on her, and said to her, <span class="j">“Don’t
cry.”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,14);</script>He came
near and touched the coffin, and the bearers stood still. He said, <span
class="j">“Young man, I tell you, arise!”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,15);</script>He who was dead sat up, and began
to speak. And he gave him to his mother.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,16);</script>Fear took hold of all,
and they glorified God, saying, “A great prophet has arisen among us!”
and, “God has visited his people!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,17);</script>This report went out concerning
him in the whole of Judea, and in all the surrounding region.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,18);</script>The disciples of John
told him about all these things. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,19);</script>John, calling to himself two of
his disciples, sent them to Jesus, saying, “Are you the one who is
coming, or should we look for another?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,20);</script>When the men had come to him,
they said, “John the Baptizer has sent us to you, saying, ‘Are you he
who comes, or should we look for another?’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,21);</script>In that hour he cured
many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits; and to many who were blind
he gave sight. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,22);</script>Jesus
answered them, <span class="j">“Go and tell John the things which you
have seen and heard: that the blind receive their sight, the lame walk,
the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the
poor have good news preached to them. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(7,23);</script>Blessed is he who finds no
occasion for stumbling in me.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,24);</script>When John’s
messengers had departed, he began to tell the multitudes about John, <span

by the wind? <script type="text/javascript">cj(7,25);</script>But what did
you go out to see? A man clothed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are
gorgeously dressed, and live delicately, are in kings’ courts. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(7,26);</script>But what did you go out to see? A
prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet. <script

who are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the
Baptizer, yet he who is least in the Kingdom of God is greater than
he.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,29);</script>When all the people
and the tax collectors heard this, they declared God to be just, having
been baptized with John’s baptism. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,30);</script>But the Pharisees and the lawyers
rejected the counsel of God, not being baptized by him themselves.

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,36);</script>One of the Pharisees
invited him to eat with him. He entered into the Pharisee’s house, and
sat at the table. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,37);</script>Behold,
a woman in the city who was a sinner, when she knew that he was reclining
in the Pharisee’s house, she brought an alabaster jar of ointment.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,38);</script>Standing behind at his
feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and she wiped them
with the hair of her head, kissed his feet, and anointed them with the
ointment. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,39);</script>Now when the
Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he said to himself, “This man, if
he were a prophet, would have perceived who and what kind of woman this is
who touches him, that she is a sinner.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,40);</script>Jesus answered him,

<p>He said, “Teacher, say on.”

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,43);</script>Simon answered, “He,
I suppose, to whom he forgave the most.”
<p>He said to him, <span class="j">“You have judged correctly.”</span>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,44);</script>Turning to the woman, he
said to Simon, <span class="j">“Do you see this woman? I entered into
your house, and you gave me no water for my feet, but she has wet my feet
with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(7,45);</script>You gave me no kiss, but she,
since the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss my feet. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(7,46);</script>You didn’t anoint my head with
oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(7,47);</script>Therefore I tell you, her sins,
which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is
forgiven, the same loves little.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,48);</script>He said to her, <span
class="j">“Your sins are forgiven.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,49);</script>Those who sat at the
table with him began to say to themselves, “Who is this who even
forgives sins?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,50);</script>He said to the woman,
<span class="j">“Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,1);</script>It happened soon
afterwards, that he went about through cities and villages, preaching and
bringing the good news of the Kingdom of God. With him were the twelve,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,2);</script>and certain women who had
been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary who was called
Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,3);</script>and Joanna, the wife of Chuzas,
Herod’s steward; Susanna; and many others; who served <a
href="#N18">them</a> from their possessions. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,4);</script>When a great multitude came
together, and people from every city were coming to him, he spoke by a
parable. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,5);</script><span
class="j">“The farmer went out to sow his seed. As he sowed, some fell
along the road, and it was trampled under foot, and the birds of the sky
devoured it. <script type="text/javascript">cj(8,6);</script>Other seed
fell on the rock, and as soon as it grew, it withered away, because it had
no moisture. <script type="text/javascript">cj(8,7);</script>Other fell
amid the thorns, and the thorns grew with it, and choked it. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,8);</script>Other fell into the good ground,
and grew, and brought forth fruit one hundred times.”</span> As he said
these things, he called out, <span class="j">“He who has ears to hear,
let him hear!”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,9);</script>Then his disciples
asked him, “What does this parable mean?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,10);</script>He said, <span
class="j">“To you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of
God, but to the rest in parables; that ‘seeing they may not see, and
hearing they may not understand.’<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N19">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,11);</script>Now the parable is this: The seed
is the word of God. <script type="text/javascript">cj(8,12);</script>Those
along the road are those who hear, then the devil comes, and takes away
the word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,13);</script>Those on the rock are they who,
when they hear, receive the word with joy; but these have no root, who
believe for a while, then fall away in time of temptation. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,14);</script>That which fell among the thorns,
these are those who have heard, and as they go on their way they are
choked with cares, riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to
maturity. <script type="text/javascript">cj(8,15);</script>That in the
good ground, these are such as in an honest and good heart, having heard
the word, hold it tightly, and bring forth fruit with patience.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,16);</script>“No one, when he has lit a
lamp, covers it with a container, or puts it under a bed; but puts it on a
stand, that those who enter in may see the light. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,17);</script>For nothing is hidden, that will
not be revealed; nor anything secret, that will not be known and come to
light. <script type="text/javascript">cj(8,18);</script>Be careful
therefore how you hear. For whoever has, to him will be given; and whoever
doesn’t have, from him will be taken away even that which he thinks he
has.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,19);</script>His mother and
brothers came to him, and they could not come near him for the crowd.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,20);</script>It was told him by some
saying, “Your mother and your brothers stand outside, desiring to see
you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,21);</script>But he answered them,
<span class="j">“My mother and my brothers are these who hear the word
of God, and do it.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,22);</script>Now it happened on one
of those days, that he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples, and
he said to them, <span class="j">“Let’s go over to the other side of
the lake.”</span> So they launched out. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,23);</script>But as they sailed, he fell
asleep. A wind storm came down on the lake, and they were taking on
dangerous amounts of water. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,24);</script>They came to him, and awoke him,
saying, “Master, master, we are dying!” He awoke, and rebuked the wind
and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and it was calm.<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N20">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,25);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Where is your faith?”</span> Being afraid they marveled,
saying one to another, “Who is this, then, that he commands even the
winds and the water, and they obey him?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,26);</script>They arrived at the country of
the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,27);</script>When Jesus stepped
ashore, a certain man out of the city who had demons for a long time met
him. He wore no clothes, and didn’t live in a house, but in the tombs.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,28);</script>When he saw Jesus, he
cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, “What
do I have to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I beg you,
don’t torment me!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,29);</script>For Jesus was commanding the
unclean spirit to come out of the man. For the unclean spirit had often
seized the man. He was kept under guard, and bound with chains and
fetters. Breaking the bands apart, he was driven by the demon into the
desert.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,30);</script>Jesus asked him, <span
class="j">“What is your name?”</span>
<p>He said, “Legion,” for many demons had entered into him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,31);</script>They begged him that he would not
command them to go into the abyss. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,32);</script>Now there was there a herd of
many pigs feeding on the mountain, and they begged him that he would allow
them to enter into those. He allowed them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,33);</script>The demons came out from the man,
and entered into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into
the lake, and were drowned. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,34);</script>When those who fed them saw what
had happened, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,35);</script>People went out to see
what had happened. They came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the
demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus’ feet, clothed and in his right
mind; and they were afraid. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,36);</script>Those who saw it told them how he
who had been possessed by demons was healed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,37);</script>All the people of the surrounding
country of the Gadarenes asked him to depart from them, for they were very
much afraid. He entered into the boat, and returned. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,38);</script>But the man from whom the demons
had gone out begged him that he might go with him, but Jesus sent him
away, saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,39);</script><span
class="j">“Return to your house, and declare what great things God has
done for you.”</span> He went his way, proclaiming throughout the whole
city what great things Jesus had done for him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,40);</script>It happened, when
Jesus returned, that the multitude welcomed him, for they were all waiting
for him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,41);</script>Behold, there
came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue. He fell down
at Jesus’ feet, and begged him to come into his house, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,42);</script>for he had an only daughter,
about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as he went, the
multitudes pressed against him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,43);</script>A woman who had a flow of blood
for twelve years, who had spent all her living on physicians, and could
not be healed by any, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,44);</script>came behind him, and touched the
<a href="#N21">fringe</a> of his cloak, and immediately the flow of her
blood stopped. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,45);</script>Jesus
said, <span class="j">“Who touched me?”</span>
<p>When all denied it, Peter and those with him said, “Master, the
multitudes press and jostle you, and you say, <span class="j">‘Who
touched me?’</span>”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,46);</script>But Jesus said, <span
class="j">“Someone did touch me, for I perceived that power has gone out
of me.”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,47);</script>When the
woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down
before him declared to him in the presence of all the people the reason
why she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,48);</script>He said to her, <span
class="j">“Daughter, cheer up. Your faith has made you well. Go in
peace.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,49);</script>While he still spoke,
one from the ruler of the synagogue’s house came, saying to him, “Your
daughter is dead. Don’t trouble the Teacher.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,50);</script>But Jesus hearing it,
answered him, <span class="j">“Don’t be afraid. Only believe, and she
will be healed.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,51);</script>When he came to the
house, he didn’t allow anyone to enter in, except Peter, John, James,
the father of the child, and her mother. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,52);</script>All were weeping and mourning
her, but he said, <span class="j">“Don’t weep. She isn’t dead, but
sleeping.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,53);</script>They were ridiculing
him, knowing that she was dead. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,54);</script>But he put them all outside, and
taking her by the hand, he called, saying, <span class="j">“Child,
arise!”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,55);</script>Her
spirit returned, and she rose up immediately. He commanded that something
be given to her to eat. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,56);</script>Her parents were amazed, but he
commanded them to tell no one what had been done.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,1);</script>He called <a
href="#N22">the twelve</a> together, and gave them power and authority
over all demons, and to cure diseases. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,2);</script>He sent them forth to preach the
Kingdom of God, and to heal the sick. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,3);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Take nothing for your journey—neither staffs, nor wallet,
nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats apiece. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(9,4);</script>Into whatever house you enter,
stay there, and depart from there. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(9,5);</script>As many as don’t receive you,
when you depart from that city, shake off even the dust from your feet for
a testimony against them.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,6);</script>They departed, and went
throughout the villages, preaching the Good News, and healing everywhere.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,7);</script>Now Herod the tetrarch
heard of all that was done by him; and he was very perplexed, because it
was said by some that John had risen from the dead, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,8);</script>and by some that Elijah had
appeared, and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,9);</script>Herod said, “John I
beheaded, but who is this, about whom I hear such things?” He sought to
see him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,10);</script>The apostles,
when they had returned, told him what things they had done.
<p>He took them, and withdrew apart to a deserted place of a city called
Bethsaida. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,11);</script>But the
multitudes, perceiving it, followed him. He welcomed them, and spoke to
them of the Kingdom of God, and he cured those who needed healing. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,12);</script>The day began to wear away; and
the twelve came, and said to him, “Send the multitude away, that they
may go into the surrounding villages and farms, and lodge, and get food,
for we are here in a deserted place.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,13);</script>But he said to them,
<span class="j">“You give them something to eat.”</span>
<p>They said, “We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we
should go and buy food for all these people.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,14);</script>For they were about five thousand
men.
<p>He said to his disciples, <span class="j">“Make them sit down in
groups of about fifty each.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,15);</script>They did so, and made them all
sit down. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,16);</script>He took the
five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to the sky, he blessed them,
and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the
multitude. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,17);</script>They ate, and
were all filled. They gathered up twelve baskets of broken pieces that
were left over.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,18);</script>It happened, as he was
praying alone, that the disciples were with him, and he asked them, <span
class="j">“Who do the multitudes say that I am?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,19);</script>They answered,
“‘John the Baptizer,’ but others say, ‘Elijah,’ and others, that
one of the old prophets is risen again.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,20);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“But who do you say that I am?”</span>
<p>Peter answered, “The Christ of God.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,21);</script>But he warned them,
and commanded them to tell this to no one, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,22);</script>saying, <span class="j">“The
Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, chief
priests, and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised
up.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,23);</script>He said to all, <span
class="j">“If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself,
take up his cross,<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N23">*</a></sup></font> and follow me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(9,24);</script>For whoever desires to save his
life will lose it, but whoever will lose his life for my sake, the same
will save it. <script type="text/javascript">cj(9,25);</script>For what
does it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses or forfeits
his own self? <script type="text/javascript">cj(9,26);</script>For whoever
will be ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be
ashamed, when he comes in his glory, and the glory of the Father, and of
the holy angels. <script type="text/javascript">cj(9,27);</script>But I
tell you the truth: There are some of those who stand here, who will in no
way taste of death, until they see the Kingdom of God.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,28);</script>It happened about
eight days after these sayings, that he took with him Peter, John, and
James, and went up onto the mountain to pray. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,29);</script>As he was praying, the appearance
of his face was altered, and his clothing became white and dazzling.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,30);</script>Behold, two men were
talking with him, who were Moses and Elijah, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,31);</script>who appeared in glory, and spoke
of his <a href="#N24">departure,</a> which he was about to accomplish at
Jerusalem.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,32);</script>Now Peter and those
who were with him were heavy with sleep, but when they were fully awake,
they saw his glory, and the two men who stood with him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,33);</script>It happened, as they were parting
from him, that Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be
here. Let’s make three tents: one for you, and one for Moses, and one
for Elijah,” not knowing what he said.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,34);</script>While he said these
things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they
entered into the cloud. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,35);</script>A
voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my beloved Son. Listen to
him!” <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,36);</script>When the voice
came, Jesus was found alone. They were silent, and told no one in those
days any of the things which they had seen.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,37);</script>It happened on the
next day, when they had come down from the mountain, that a great
multitude met him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,38);</script>Behold, a man from the crowd
called out, saying, “Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my
only child. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,39);</script>Behold, a
spirit takes him, he suddenly cries out, and it convulses him so that he
foams, and it hardly departs from him, bruising him severely. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,40);</script>I begged your disciples to cast
it out, and they couldn’t.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,41);</script>Jesus answered, <span
class="j">“Faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with
you and bear with you? Bring your son here.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,42);</script>While he was still
coming, the demon threw him down and convulsed him violently. But Jesus
rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his
father. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,43);</script>They were all
astonished at the majesty of God.
<p>But while all were marveling at all the things which Jesus did, he said
to his disciples, <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,44);</script><span
class="j">“Let these words sink into your ears, for the Son of Man will
be delivered up into the hands of men.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,45);</script>But they didn’t understand this
saying. It was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it, and
they were afraid to ask him about this saying.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,46);</script>There arose an
argument among them about which of them was the greatest. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,47);</script>Jesus, perceiving the reasoning
of their hearts, took a little child, and set him by his side, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,48);</script>and said to them, <span
class="j">“Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me.
Whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For whoever is least among
you all, this one will be great.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,49);</script>John answered,
“Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we forbade
him, because he doesn’t follow with us.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,50);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“Don’t forbid him, for he who is not against us is for
us.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,51);</script>It came to pass, when
the days were near that he should be taken up, he intently set his face to
go to Jerusalem, <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,52);</script>and sent
messengers before his face. They went, and entered into a village of the
Samaritans, so as to prepare for him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,53);</script>They didn’t receive him,
because he was traveling with his face set towards Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,54);</script>When his disciples, James and
John, saw this, they said, “Lord, do you want us to command fire to come
down from the sky, and destroy them, just as Elijah did?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,55);</script>But he turned and
rebuked them, <span class="j">“You don’t know of what kind of spirit
you are. <script type="text/javascript">cj(9,56);</script>For the Son of
Man didn’t come to destroy men’s lives, but to save them.”</span>
<p>They went to another village. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,57);</script>As they went on the way, a
certain man said to him, “I want to follow you wherever you go, Lord.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,58);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have
nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,59);</script>He said to another,
<span class="j">“Follow me!”</span>
<p>But he said, “Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,60);</script>But Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“Leave the dead to bury their own dead, but you go and
announce the Kingdom of God.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,61);</script>Another also said,
“I want to follow you, Lord, but first allow me to say good-bye to those
who are at my house.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,62);</script>But Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“No one, having put his hand to the plow, and looking
back, is fit for the Kingdom of God.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,1);</script>Now after these
things, the Lord also appointed seventy others, and sent them two by two
<a href="#N25">ahead of him</a> into every city and place, where he was
about to come. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,2);</script>Then he
said to them, <span class="j">“The harvest is indeed plentiful, but the
laborers are few. Pray therefore to the Lord of the harvest, that he may
send out laborers into his harvest. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,3);</script>Go your ways. Behold, I send you
out as lambs among wolves. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,4);</script>Carry no purse, nor wallet, nor
sandals. Greet no one on the way. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,5);</script>Into whatever house you enter,
first say, ‘Peace be to this house.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,6);</script>If a son of peace is there, your
peace will rest on him; but if not, it will return to you. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,7);</script>Remain in that same house, eating
and drinking the things they give, for the laborer is worthy of his wages.
Don’t go from house to house. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,8);</script>Into whatever city you enter, and
they receive you, eat the things that are set before you. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,9);</script>Heal the sick who are therein,
and tell them, ‘The Kingdom of God has come near to you.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,10);</script>But into whatever city you
enter, and they don’t receive you, go out into its streets and say,
<script type="text/javascript">cj(10,11);</script>‘Even the dust from
your city that clings to us, we wipe off against you. Nevertheless know
this, that the Kingdom of God has come near to you.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,12);</script>I tell you, it will be more
tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that city.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,13);</script>“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to
you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon
which were done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in
sackcloth and ashes. <script type="text/javascript">cj(10,14);</script>But
it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(10,15);</script>You, Capernaum, who are
exalted to heaven, will be brought down to <a href="#N26">Hades.</a>
<script type="text/javascript">cj(10,16);</script>Whoever listens to you
listens to me, and whoever rejects you rejects me. Whoever rejects me
rejects him who sent me.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,17);</script>The seventy returned
with joy, saying, “Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your
name!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,18);</script>He said to them,
<span class="j">“I saw Satan having fallen like lightning from heaven.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(10,19);</script>Behold, I give you
authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of
the enemy. Nothing will in any way hurt you. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,20);</script>Nevertheless, don’t rejoice in
this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are
written in heaven.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,21);</script>In that same hour
Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and said, <span class="j">“I thank
you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things
from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to little children.
Yes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,22);</script>Turning to the
disciples, he said, <span class="j">“All things have been delivered to
me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is, except the Father, and who
the Father is, except the Son, and he to whomever the Son desires to
reveal him.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,23);</script>Turning to the
disciples, he said privately, <span class="j">“Blessed are the eyes
which see the things that you see, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,24);</script>for I tell you that many
prophets and kings desired to see the things which you see, and didn’t
see them, and to hear the things which you hear, and didn’t hear
them.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,25);</script>Behold, a certain
lawyer stood up and tested him, saying, “Teacher, what shall I do to
inherit eternal life?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,26);</script>He said to him, <span
class="j">“What is written in the law? How do you read it?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,27);</script>He answered, “You
shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with
all your strength, and with all your mind;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N27">*</a></sup></font> and your neighbor as
yourself.”<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N28">*</a></sup></font>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,28);</script>He said to him, <span
class="j">“You have answered correctly. Do this, and you will
live.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,29);</script>But he, desiring to
justify himself, asked Jesus, “Who is my neighbor?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,30);</script>Jesus answered, <span
class="j">“A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and
he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed,
leaving him half dead. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,31);</script>By chance a certain priest was
going down that way. When he saw him, he passed by on the other side.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(10,32);</script>In the same way a Levite
also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(10,33);</script>But a certain Samaritan,
as he traveled, came where he was. When he saw him, he was moved with
compassion, <script type="text/javascript">cj(10,34);</script>came to him,
and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. He set him on his own
animal, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,35);</script>On the next day, when he
departed, he took out two denarii, and gave them to the host, and said to
him, ‘Take care of him. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will repay you
when I return.’ <script type="text/javascript">cj(10,36);</script>Now
which of these three do you think seemed to be a neighbor to him who fell
among the robbers?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,37);</script>He said, “He who
showed mercy on him.”
<p>Then Jesus said to him, <span class="j">“Go and do likewise.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,38);</script>It happened as they
went on their way, he entered into a certain village, and a certain woman
named Martha received him into her house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,39);</script>She had a sister called Mary,
who also sat at Jesus’ feet, and heard his word. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,40);</script>But Martha was distracted with
much serving, and she came up to him, and said, “Lord, don’t you care
that my sister left me to serve alone? Ask her therefore to help me.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,41);</script>Jesus answered her,
<span class="j">“Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many
things, <script type="text/javascript">cj(10,42);</script>but one thing is
needed. Mary has chosen the good part, which will not be taken away from
her.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,1);</script>It happened, that when
he finished praying in a certain place, one of his disciples said to him,
“Lord, teach us to pray, just as John also taught his disciples.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,2);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“When you pray, say,</span>
<dl><span class="j">
<dt>‘Our Father in heaven,
<dd>may your name be kept holy.
<dt>May your Kingdom come.
<dd>May your will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cj(11,3);</script>Give us day by day
our daily bread.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cj(11,4);</script>Forgive us our sins,
<dd>for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us.
<dt>Bring us not into temptation,
<dd>but deliver us from the evil one.’”</span>
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,5);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Which of you, if you go to a friend at midnight, and tell
him, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves of bread, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,6);</script>for a friend of mine has come to
me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him,’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,7);</script>and he from within will answer
and say, ‘Don’t bother me. The door is now shut, and my children are
with me in bed. I can’t get up and give it to you’? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,8);</script>I tell you, although he will not
rise and give it to him because he is his friend, yet because of his
persistence, he will get up and give him as many as he needs.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,9);</script>“I tell you, keep asking, and
it will be given you. Keep seeking, and you will find. Keep knocking, and
it will be opened to you. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,10);</script>For everyone who asks receives.
He who seeks finds. To him who knocks it will be opened.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,11);</script>“Which of you fathers, if your
son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, he
won’t give him a snake instead of a fish, will he? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,12);</script>Or if he asks for an egg, he
won’t give him a scorpion, will he? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,13);</script>If you then, being evil, know
how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly
Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,14);</script>He was casting out a
demon, and it was mute. It happened, when the demon had gone out, the mute
man spoke; and the multitudes marveled. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,15);</script>But some of them said, “He
casts out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,16);</script>Others, testing him, sought from
him a sign from heaven. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,17);</script>But he, knowing their thoughts,
said to them, <span class="j">“Every kingdom divided against itself is
brought to desolation. A house divided against itself falls. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,18);</script>If Satan also is divided against
himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by
Beelzebul. <script type="text/javascript">cj(11,19);</script>But if I cast
out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore
will they be your judges. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,20);</script>But if I by the finger of God
cast out demons, then the Kingdom of God has come to you.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,21);</script>“When the strong man, fully
armed, guards his own dwelling, his goods are safe. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,22);</script>But when someone stronger
attacks him and overcomes him, he takes from him his whole armor in which
he trusted, and divides his spoils.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,23);</script>“He that is not with me is
against me. He who doesn’t gather with me scatters. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,24);</script>The unclean spirit, when he has
gone out of the man, passes through dry places, seeking rest, and finding
none, he says, ‘I will turn back to my house from which I came out.’
<script type="text/javascript">cj(11,25);</script>When he returns, he
finds it swept and put in order. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,26);</script>Then he goes, and takes seven
other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter in and dwell there.
The last state of that man becomes worse than the first.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,27);</script>It came to pass, as
he said these things, a certain woman out of the multitude lifted up her
voice, and said to him, “Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the
breasts which nursed you!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,28);</script>But he said, <span
class="j">“On the contrary, blessed are those who hear the word of God,
and keep it.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,29);</script>When the multitudes
were gathering together to him, he began to say, <span class="j">“This
is an evil generation. It seeks after a sign. No sign will be given to it
but the sign of Jonah, the prophet. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,30);</script>For even as Jonah became a sign
to the Ninevites, so will also the Son of Man be to this generation.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(11,31);</script>The Queen of the South
will rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and will
condemn them: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom
of Solomon; and behold, one greater than Solomon is here. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,32);</script>The men of Nineveh will stand up
in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it: for they
repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, one greater than Jonah is
here.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,33);</script>“No one, when he has lit a
lamp, puts it in a cellar or under a basket, but on a stand, that those
who come in may see the light. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,34);</script>The lamp of the body is the eye.
Therefore when your eye is good, your whole body is also full of light;
but when it is evil, your body also is full of darkness. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,35);</script>Therefore see whether the light
that is in you isn’t darkness. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,36);</script>If therefore your whole body is
full of light, having no part dark, it will be wholly full of light, as
when the lamp with its bright shining gives you light.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,37);</script>Now as he spoke, a
certain Pharisee asked him to dine with him. He went in, and sat at the
table. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,38);</script>When the Pharisee
saw it, he marveled that he had not first washed himself before dinner.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,39);</script>The Lord said to him,
<span class="j">“Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of
the platter, but your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(11,40);</script>You foolish ones,
didn’t he who made the outside make the inside also? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,41);</script>But give for gifts to the needy
those things which are within, and behold, all things will be clean to
you. <script type="text/javascript">cj(11,42);</script>But woe to you
Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and every herb, but you bypass
justice and the love of God. You ought to have done these, and not to have
left the other undone. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,43);</script>Woe to you Pharisees! For you
love the best seats in the synagogues, and the greetings in the
marketplaces. <script type="text/javascript">cj(11,44);</script>Woe to
you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like hidden graves,
and the men who walk over them don’t know it.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,45);</script>One of the lawyers
answered him, “Teacher, in saying this you insult us also.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,46);</script>He said, <span
class="j">“Woe to you lawyers also! For you load men with burdens that
are difficult to carry, and you yourselves won’t even lift one finger to
help carry those burdens. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,47);</script>Woe to you! For you build the
tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,48);</script>So you testify and consent to
the works of your fathers. For they killed them, and you build their
tombs. <script type="text/javascript">cj(11,49);</script>Therefore also
the wisdom of God said, ‘I will send to them prophets and apostles; and
some of them they will kill and persecute, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,50);</script>that the blood of all the
prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required
of this generation; <script type="text/javascript">cj(11,51);</script>from
the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah, who perished between the
altar and the sanctuary.’ Yes, I tell you, it will be required of this
generation. <script type="text/javascript">cj(11,52);</script>Woe to you
lawyers! For you took away the key of knowledge. You didn’t enter in
yourselves, and those who were entering in, you hindered.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,53);</script>As he said these
things to them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be terribly angry,
and to draw many things out of him; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,54);</script>lying in wait for him, and
seeking to catch him in something he might say, that they might accuse him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,1);</script>Meanwhile, when a
multitude of many thousands had gathered together, so much so that they
trampled on each other, he began to tell his disciples first of all, <span
class="j">“Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(12,2);</script>But there is nothing
covered up, that will not be revealed, nor hidden, that will not be known.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(12,3);</script>Therefore whatever you
have said in the darkness will be heard in the light. What you have spoken
in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed on the housetops.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,4);</script>“I tell you, my friends,
don’t be afraid of those who kill the body, and after that have no more
that they can do. <script type="text/javascript">cj(12,5);</script>But I
will warn you whom you should fear. Fear him, who after he has killed, has
power to cast into <a href="#N29">Gehenna.</a> Yes, I tell you, fear him.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,6);</script>“Aren’t five sparrows sold
for two <a href="#N30">assaria coins</a>? Not one of them is forgotten by
God. <script type="text/javascript">cj(12,7);</script>But the very hairs
of your head are all numbered. Therefore don’t be afraid. You are of
more value than many sparrows.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,8);</script>“I tell you, everyone who
confesses me before men, him will the Son of Man also confess before the
angels of God; <script type="text/javascript">cj(12,9);</script>but he who
denies me in the presence of men will be denied in the presence of the
angels of God. <script type="text/javascript">cj(12,10);</script>Everyone
who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but those who
blaspheme against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,11);</script>When they bring you before the
synagogues, the rulers, and the authorities, don’t be anxious how or
what you will answer, or what you will say; <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,12);</script>for the Holy Spirit will teach
you in that same hour what you must say.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,13);</script>One of the multitude
said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with
me.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,14);</script>But he said to him,
<span class="j">“Man, who made me a judge or an arbitrator over
you?”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,15);</script>He said
to them, <span class="j">“Beware! Keep yourselves from covetousness, for
a man’s life doesn’t consist of the abundance of the things which he
possesses.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,16);</script>He spoke a parable to
them, saying, <span class="j">“The ground of a certain rich man brought
forth abundantly. <script type="text/javascript">cj(12,17);</script>He
reasoned within himself, saying, ‘What will I do, because I don’t have
room to store my crops?’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,18);</script>He said, ‘This is what I will
do. I will pull down my barns, and build bigger ones, and there I will
store all my grain and my goods. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,19);</script>I will tell my soul, “Soul,
you have many goods laid up for many years. Take your ease, eat, drink, be
merry.”’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,20);</script>“But God said to him, ‘You
foolish one, tonight your soul is required of you. The things which you
have prepared—whose will they be?’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,21);</script>So is he who lays up treasure
for himself, and is not rich toward God.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,22);</script>He said to his
disciples, <span class="j">“Therefore I tell you, don’t be anxious for
your life, what you will eat, nor yet for your body, what you will wear.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(12,23);</script>Life is more than food,
and the body is more than clothing. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,24);</script>Consider the ravens: they
don’t sow, they don’t reap, they have no warehouse or barn, and God
feeds them. How much more valuable are you than birds! <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,25);</script>Which of you by being anxious
can add a cubit to his height? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,26);</script>If then you aren’t able to do
even the least things, why are you anxious about the rest? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,27);</script>Consider the lilies, how they
grow. They don’t toil, neither do they spin; yet I tell you, even
Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,28);</script>But if this is how God clothes
the grass in the field, which today exists, and tomorrow is cast into the
oven, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,29);</script>Don’t seek what you will eat
or what you will drink; neither be anxious. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,30);</script>For the nations of the world
seek after all of these things, but your Father knows that you need these
things. <script type="text/javascript">cj(12,31);</script>But seek God’s
Kingdom, and all these things will be added to you. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,32);</script>Don’t be afraid, little flock,
for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the Kingdom. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,33);</script>Sell that which you have, and
give gifts to the needy. Make for yourselves purses which don’t grow
old, a treasure in the heavens that doesn’t fail, where no thief
approaches, neither moth destroys. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,34);</script>For where your treasure is,
there will your heart be also.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,35);</script>“Let your waist be dressed and
your lamps burning. <script type="text/javascript">cj(12,36);</script>Be

that, when he comes and knocks, they may immediately open to him. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,37);</script>Blessed are those servants, whom
the lord will find watching when he comes. Most certainly I tell you, that
he will dress himself, and make them recline, and will come and serve
them. <script type="text/javascript">cj(12,38);</script>They will be
blessed if he comes in the second or third watch, and finds them so.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(12,39);</script>But know this, that if
the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming, he
would have watched, and not allowed his house to be broken into. <script

Son of Man is coming in an hour that you don’t expect him.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,41);</script>Peter said to him,
“Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to everybody?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,42);</script>The Lord said, <span

set over his household, to give them their portion of food at the right

type="text/javascript">cj(12,44);</script>Truly I tell you, that he will
set him over all that he has. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,45);</script>But if that servant says in his
heart, ‘My lord delays his coming,’ and begins to beat the menservants
and the maidservants, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,46);</script>then the lord of that servant
will come in a day when he isn’t expecting him, and in an hour that he
doesn’t know, and will cut him in two, and place his portion with the
unfaithful. <script type="text/javascript">cj(12,47);</script>That
servant, who knew his lord’s will, and didn’t prepare, nor do what he
wanted, will be beaten with many stripes, <script

did things worthy of stripes, will be beaten with few stripes. To whomever
much is given, of him will much be required; and to whom much was

type="text/javascript">cj(12,58);</script>For when you are going with your
adversary before the magistrate, try diligently on the way to be released
from him, lest perhaps he drag you to the judge, and the judge deliver you
to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,59);</script>I tell you, you will by no means
get out of there, until you have paid the very last <a
href="#N32">penny.</a>”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,1);</script>Now there were some
present at the same time who told him about the Galileans, whose blood
Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,2);</script>Jesus answered them, <span
class="j">“Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all
the other Galileans, because they suffered such things? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,3);</script>I tell you, no, but unless you
repent, you will all perish in the same way. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,4);</script>Or those eighteen, on whom the
tower in Siloam fell, and killed them; do you think that they were worse
offenders than all the men who dwell in Jerusalem? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,5);</script>I tell you, no, but, unless you
repent, you will all perish in the same way.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,6);</script>He spoke this parable.
<span class="j">“A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard,
and he came seeking fruit on it, and found none. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,7);</script>He said to the vine dresser,
‘Behold, these three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig
tree, and found none. Cut it down. Why does it waste the soil?’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,8);</script>He answered, ‘Lord, leave it
alone this year also, until I dig around it, and fertilize it. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,9);</script>If it bears fruit, fine; but if
not, after that, you can cut it down.’”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,10);</script>He was teaching in
one of the synagogues on the Sabbath day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,11);</script>Behold, there was a woman who
had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and she was bent over, and could
in no way straighten herself up. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,12);</script>When Jesus saw her, he called
her, and said to her, <span class="j">“Woman, you are freed from your
infirmity.”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,13);</script>He
laid his hands on her, and immediately she stood up straight, and
glorified God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,14);</script>The ruler of the
synagogue, being indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, said
to the multitude, “There are six days in which men ought to work.
Therefore come on those days and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,15);</script>Therefore the Lord
answered him, <span class="j">“You hypocrites! Doesn’t each one of you
free his ox or his donkey from the stall on the Sabbath, and lead him away
to water? <script type="text/javascript">cj(13,16);</script>Ought not this
woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan had bound eighteen long
years, be freed from this bondage on the Sabbath day?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,17);</script>As he said these
things, all his adversaries were disappointed, and all the multitude
rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,18);</script>He said, <span
class="j">“What is the Kingdom of God like? To what shall I compare it?
<script type="text/javascript">cj(13,19);</script>It is like a grain of
mustard seed, which a man took, and put in his own garden. It grew, and
became a large tree, and the birds of the sky lodged in its branches.”
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,20);</script>Again he said, “To what shall
I compare the Kingdom of God? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,21);</script>It is like yeast, which a woman
took and hid in <a href="#N33">three measures</a> of flour, until it was
all leavened.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,22);</script>He went on his way
through cities and villages, teaching, and traveling on to Jerusalem.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,23);</script>One said to him,
“Lord, are they few who are saved?”
<p>He said to them, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,24);</script><span class="j">“Strive to
enter in by the narrow door, for many, I tell you, will seek to enter in,
and will not be able. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,25);</script>When once the master of the
house has risen up, and has shut the door, and you begin to stand outside,
and to knock at the door, saying, ‘Lord, Lord, open to us!’ then he
will answer and tell you, ‘I don’t know you or where you come from.’
<script type="text/javascript">cj(13,26);</script>Then you will begin to
say, ‘We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our
streets.’ <script type="text/javascript">cj(13,27);</script>He will say,
‘I tell you, I don’t know where you come from. Depart from me, all you
workers of iniquity.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,28);</script>There will be weeping and
gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the
prophets, in the Kingdom of God, and yourselves being thrown outside.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(13,29);</script>They will come from the
east, west, north, and south, and will sit down in the Kingdom of God.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(13,30);</script>Behold, there are some
who are last who will be first, and there are some who are first who will
be last.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,31);</script>On that same day,
some Pharisees came, saying to him, “Get out of here, and go away, for
Herod wants to kill you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,32);</script>He said to them,
<span class="j">“Go and tell that fox, ‘Behold, I cast out demons and
perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I complete my mission.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(13,33);</script>Nevertheless I must go
on my way today and tomorrow and the next day, for it can’t be that a
prophet perish outside of Jerusalem.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,34);</script>“Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that
kills the prophets, and stones those who are sent to her! How often I
wanted to gather your children together, like a hen gathers her own brood
under her wings, and you refused! <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,35);</script>Behold, your house is left to
you desolate. I tell you, you will not see me, until you say, ‘Blessed

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,1);</script>It happened, when he
went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a Sabbath to
eat bread, that they were watching him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,2);</script>Behold, a certain man who had
dropsy was in front of him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,3);</script>Jesus, answering, spoke to the
lawyers and Pharisees, saying, <span class="j">“Is it lawful to heal on
the Sabbath?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,4);</script>But they were silent.
<p>He took him, and healed him, and let him go. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,5);</script>He answered them, <span
class="j">“Which of you, if your <a href="#N35">son</a> or an ox fell
into a well, wouldn’t immediately pull him out on a Sabbath
day?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,6);</script>They couldn’t answer
him regarding these things.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,7);</script>He spoke a parable to
those who were invited, when he noticed how they chose the best seats, and
said to them, <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,8);</script><span
class="j">“When you are invited by anyone to a marriage feast, don’t
sit in the best seat, since perhaps someone more honorable than you might
be invited by him, <script type="text/javascript">cj(14,9);</script>and he
who invited both of you would come and tell you, ‘Make room for this
person.’ Then you would begin, with shame, to take the lowest place.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(14,10);</script>But when you are
invited, go and sit in the lowest place, so that when he who invited you
comes, he may tell you, ‘Friend, move up higher.’ Then you will be
honored in the presence of all who sit at the table with you. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,11);</script>For everyone who exalts himself
will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,12);</script>He also said to the
one who had invited him, <span class="j">“When you make a dinner or a
supper, don’t call your friends, nor your brothers, nor your kinsmen,
nor rich neighbors, or perhaps they might also return the favor, and pay
you back. <script type="text/javascript">cj(14,13);</script>But when you
make a feast, ask the poor, the maimed, the lame, or the blind; <script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,14);</script>and you will be blessed, because
they don’t have the resources to repay you. For you will be repaid in
the resurrection of the righteous.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,15);</script>When one of those who
sat at the table with him heard these things, he said to him, “Blessed
is he who will feast in the Kingdom of God!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,16);</script>But he said to him,
<span class="j">“A certain man made a great supper, and he invited many
people. <script type="text/javascript">cj(14,17);</script>He sent out his
servant at supper time to tell those who were invited, ‘Come, for
everything is ready now.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,18);</script>They all as one began to make
excuses.
</span><p><span class="j">“The first said to him, ‘I have bought a
field, and I must go and see it. Please have me excused.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,19);</script>“Another said, ‘I have
bought five yoke of oxen, and I must go try them out. Please have me
excused.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,20);</script>“Another said, ‘I have
married a wife, and therefore I can’t come.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,21);</script>“That servant came, and told
his lord these things. Then the master of the house, being angry, said to
his servant, ‘Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and
bring in the poor, maimed, blind, and lame.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,22);</script>“The servant said, ‘Lord, it
is done as you commanded, and there is still room.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,23);</script>“The lord said to the servant,
‘Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that
my house may be filled. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,24);</script>For I tell you that none of
those men who were invited will taste of my supper.’”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,25);</script>Now great multitudes
were going with him. He turned and said to them, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,26);</script><span class="j">“If anyone
comes to me, and doesn’t <a href="#N36">disregard</a> his own father,
mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters, yes, and his own life also,
he can’t be my disciple. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,27);</script>Whoever doesn’t bear his own
cross, and come after me, can’t be my disciple. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,28);</script>For which of you, desiring to
build a tower, doesn’t first sit down and count the cost, to see if he
has enough to complete it? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,29);</script>Or perhaps, when he has laid a
foundation, and is not able to finish, everyone who sees begins to mock
him, <script type="text/javascript">cj(14,30);</script>saying, ‘This man
began to build, and wasn’t able to finish.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,31);</script>Or what king, as he goes to
encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and consider
whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him
with twenty thousand? <script type="text/javascript">cj(14,32);</script>Or
else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends an envoy, and asks
for conditions of peace. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,33);</script>So therefore whoever of you who
doesn’t renounce all that he has, he can’t be my disciple. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,34);</script>Salt is good, but if the salt
becomes flat and tasteless, with what do you season it? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,35);</script>It is fit neither for the soil
nor for the manure pile. It is thrown out. He who has ears to hear, let
him hear.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,1);</script>Now all the tax
collectors and sinners were coming close to him to hear him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,2);</script>The Pharisees and the scribes
murmured, saying, “This man welcomes sinners, and eats with them.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,3);</script>He told them this
parable. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,4);</script><span
class="j">“Which of you men, if you had one hundred sheep, and lost one
of them, wouldn’t leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after
the one that was lost, until he found it? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,5);</script>When he has found it, he carries
it on his shoulders, rejoicing. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,6);</script>When he comes home, he calls
together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, ‘Rejoice with
me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,7);</script>I tell you that even so there
will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, than over
ninety-nine righteous people who need no repentance. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,8);</script>Or what woman, if she had ten <a
href="#N37">drachma</a> coins, if she lost one drachma coin, wouldn’t
light a lamp, sweep the house, and seek diligently until she found it?
<script type="text/javascript">cj(15,9);</script>When she has found it,
she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, ‘Rejoice with me,
for I have found the drachma which I had lost.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,10);</script>Even so, I tell you, there is
joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner
repenting.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,11);</script>He said, <span
class="j">“A certain man had two sons. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,12);</script>The younger of them said to his
father, ‘Father, give me my share of your property.’ He divided his
livelihood between them. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,13);</script>Not many days after, the younger
son gathered all of this together and traveled into a far country. There
he wasted his property with riotous living. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,14);</script>When he had spent all of it,
there arose a severe famine in that country, and he began to be in need.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(15,15);</script>He went and joined
himself to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his
fields to feed pigs. <script type="text/javascript">cj(15,16);</script>He
wanted to fill his belly with the husks that the pigs ate, but no one gave
him any. <script type="text/javascript">cj(15,17);</script>But when he
came to himself he said, ‘How many hired servants of my father’s have
bread enough to spare, and I’m dying with hunger! <script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,18);</script>I will get up and go to my
father, and will tell him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in
your sight. <script type="text/javascript">cj(15,19);</script>I am no more
worthy to be called your son. Make me as one of your hired servants.”’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,20);</script>“He arose, and came to his
father. But while he was still far off, his father saw him, and was moved
with compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,21);</script>The son said to him, ‘Father,
I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight. I am no longer worthy to
be called your son.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,22);</script>“But the father said to his
servants, ‘Bring out the best robe, and put it on him. Put a ring on his
hand, and shoes on his feet. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,23);</script>Bring the fattened calf, kill
it, and let us eat, and celebrate; <script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,24);</script>for this, my son, was dead, and
is alive again. He was lost, and is found.’ They began to celebrate.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,25);</script>“Now his elder son was in the
field. As he came near to the house, he heard music and dancing. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,26);</script>He called one of the servants to
him, and asked what was going on. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,27);</script>He said to him, ‘Your brother
has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has
received him back safe and healthy.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,28);</script>But he was angry, and would not
go in. Therefore his father came out, and begged him. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,29);</script>But he answered his father,
‘Behold, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed a
commandment of yours, but you never gave me a goat, that I might celebrate
with my friends. <script type="text/javascript">cj(15,30);</script>But
when this, your son, came, who has devoured your living with prostitutes,
you killed the fattened calf for him.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,31);</script>“He said to him, ‘Son, you
are always with me, and all that is mine is yours. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,32);</script>But it was appropriate to
celebrate and be glad, for this, your brother, was dead, and is alive
again. He was lost, and is found.’”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,1);</script>He also said to his
disciples, <span class="j">“There was a certain rich man who had a
manager. An accusation was made to him that this man was wasting his
possessions. <script type="text/javascript">cj(16,2);</script>He called
him, and said to him, ‘What is this that I hear about you? Give an
accounting of your management, for you can no longer be manager.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,3);</script>“The manager said within
himself, ‘What will I do, seeing that my lord is taking away the
management position from me? I don’t have strength to dig. I am ashamed
to beg. <script type="text/javascript">cj(16,4);</script>I know what I
will do, so that when I am removed from management, they may receive me
into their houses.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,5);</script>Calling each one of his lord’s
debtors to him, he said to the first, ‘How much do you owe to my
lord?’ <script type="text/javascript">cj(16,6);</script>He said, ‘A <a
href="#N38">hundred batos</a> of oil.’ He said to him, ‘Take your
bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,7);</script>Then he said to another, ‘How
much do you owe?’ He said, ‘A <a href="#N39">hundred cors</a> of
wheat.’ He said to him, ‘Take your bill, and write eighty.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,8);</script>“His lord commended the
dishonest manager because he had done wisely, for the children of this
world are, in their own generation, wiser than the children of the light.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(16,9);</script>I tell you, make for
yourselves friends by means of unrighteous mammon, so that when you fail,
they may receive you into the eternal tents. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,10);</script>He who is faithful in a very
little is faithful also in much. He who is dishonest in a very little is
also dishonest in much. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,11);</script>If therefore you have not been
faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true
riches? <script type="text/javascript">cj(16,12);</script>If you have not
been faithful in that which is another’s, who will give you that which
is your own? <script type="text/javascript">cj(16,13);</script>No servant
can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one, and love the
other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the other. You aren’t
able to serve God and <a href="#N40">mammon</a>.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,14);</script>The Pharisees, who
were lovers of money, also heard all these things, and they scoffed at
him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,15);</script>He said to them,
<span class="j">“You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of
men, but God knows your hearts. For that which is exalted among men is an
abomination in the sight of God. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,16);</script>The law and the prophets were
until John. From that time the Good News of the Kingdom of God is
preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,17);</script>But it is easier for heaven and
earth to pass away, than for one tiny stroke of a pen in the law to fall.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(16,18);</script>Everyone who divorces
his wife, and marries another, commits adultery. He who marries one who is
divorced from a husband commits adultery.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,19);</script>“Now there was a certain rich
man, and he was clothed in purple and fine linen, living in luxury every
day. <script type="text/javascript">cj(16,20);</script>A certain beggar,
named Lazarus, was laid at his gate, full of sores, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,21);</script>and desiring to be fed with the
crumbs that fell from the rich man’s table. Yes, even the dogs came and
licked his sores. <script type="text/javascript">cj(16,22);</script>It
happened that the beggar died, and that he was carried away by the angels
to Abraham’s bosom. The rich man also died, and was buried. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,23);</script>In <a href="#N41">Hades</a>, he
lifted up his eyes, being in torment, and saw Abraham far off, and Lazarus
at his bosom. <script type="text/javascript">cj(16,24);</script>He cried
and said, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he
may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue! For I am in
anguish in this flame.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,25);</script>“But Abraham said, ‘Son,
remember that you, in your lifetime, received your good things, and
Lazarus, in the same way, bad things. But now here he is comforted and you
are in anguish. <script type="text/javascript">cj(16,26);</script>Besides
all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, that those who
want to pass from here to you are not able, and that none may cross over
from there to us.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,27);</script>“He said, ‘I ask you
therefore, father, that you would send him to my father’s house; <script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,28);</script>for I have five brothers, that
he may testify to them, so they won’t also come into this place of
torment.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,29);</script>“But Abraham said to him,
‘They have Moses and the prophets. Let them listen to them.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script

Abraham, but if one goes to them from the dead, they will repent.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,31);</script>“He said to him, ‘If they
don’t listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded
if one rises from the dead.’”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,1);</script>He said to the
disciples, <span class="j">“It is impossible that no occasions of
stumbling should come, but woe to him through whom they come! <script
type="text/javascript">cj(17,2);</script>It would be better for him if a
millstone were hung around his neck, and he were thrown into the sea,
rather than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(17,3);</script>Be careful. If your
brother sins against you, rebuke him. If he repents, forgive him. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(17,4);</script>If he sins against you seven
times in the day, and seven times returns, saying, ‘I repent,’ you
shall forgive him.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,5);</script>The apostles said to
the Lord, “Increase our faith.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,6);</script>The Lord said, <span
class="j">“If you had faith like a grain of mustard seed, you would tell
this sycamore tree, ‘Be uprooted, and be planted in the sea,’ and it
would obey you. <script type="text/javascript">cj(17,7);</script>But who
is there among you, having a servant plowing or keeping sheep, that will
say, when he comes in from the field, ‘Come immediately and sit down at
the table,’ <script type="text/javascript">cj(17,8);</script>and will
not rather tell him, ‘Prepare my supper, clothe yourself properly, and
serve me, while I eat and drink. Afterward you shall eat and drink’?
<script type="text/javascript">cj(17,9);</script>Does he thank that
servant because he did the things that were commanded? I think not.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(17,10);</script>Even so you also, when
you have done all the things that are commanded you, say, ‘We are
unworthy servants. We have done our duty.’”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,11);</script>It happened as he was
on his way to Jerusalem, that he was passing along the borders of Samaria
and Galilee. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,12);</script>As he
entered into a certain village, ten men who were lepers met him, who stood
at a distance. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,13);</script>They
lifted up their voices, saying, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,14);</script>When he saw them, he
said to them, <span class="j">“Go and show yourselves to the
priests.”</span> It happened that as they went, they were cleansed.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(17,15);</script>One of them, when he saw
that he was healed, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,16);</script>He fell on his face at Jesus’
feet, giving him thanks; and he was a Samaritan. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,17);</script>Jesus answered, <span
class="j">“Weren’t the ten cleansed? But where are the nine? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(17,18);</script>Were there none found who
returned to give glory to God, except this stranger?”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,19);</script>Then he said to him, <span
class="j">“Get up, and go your way. Your faith has healed you.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,20);</script>Being asked by the
Pharisees when the Kingdom of God would come, he answered them, <span
class="j">“The Kingdom of God doesn’t come with observation; <script
type="text/javascript">cj(17,21);</script>neither will they say, ‘Look,
here!’ or, ‘Look, there!’ for behold, the Kingdom of God is within
you.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,22);</script>He said to the
disciples, <span class="j">“The days will come, when you will desire to
see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(17,23);</script>They will tell you, ‘Look,
here!’ or ‘Look, there!’ Don’t go away, nor follow after them,
<script type="text/javascript">cj(17,24);</script>for as the lightning,
when it flashes out of the one part under the sky, shines to the other
part under the sky; so will the Son of Man be in his day. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(17,25);</script>But first, he must suffer many
things and be rejected by this generation. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(17,26);</script>As it happened in the days of
Noah, even so will it be also in the days of the Son of Man. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(17,27);</script>They ate, they drank, they
married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into
the ship, and the flood came, and destroyed them all. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(17,28);</script>Likewise, even as it happened in
the days of Lot: they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they
planted, they built; <script type="text/javascript">cj(17,29);</script>but
in the day that Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and sulfur from
the sky, and destroyed them all. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(17,30);</script>It will be the same way in the
day that the Son of Man is revealed. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(17,31);</script>In that day, he who will be on
the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them
away. Let him who is in the field likewise not turn back. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(17,32);</script>Remember Lot’s wife! <script
type="text/javascript">cj(17,33);</script>Whoever seeks to save his life
loses it, but whoever loses his life preserves it. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(17,34);</script>I tell you, in that night there
will be two people in one bed. The one will be taken, and the other will
be left. <script type="text/javascript">cj(17,35);</script>There will be
two grinding grain together. One will be taken, and the other will be
left.”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,36);</script><font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N42">*</a></sup></font>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,37);</script>They, answering,
asked him, “Where, Lord?”
<p>He said to them, <span class="j">“Where the body is, there will the
vultures also be gathered together.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,1);</script>He also spoke a
parable to them that they must always pray, and not give up, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,2);</script>saying, <span class="j">“There
was a judge in a certain city who didn’t fear God, and didn’t respect
man. <script type="text/javascript">cj(18,3);</script>A widow was in that
city, and she often came to him, saying, ‘Defend me from my
adversary!’ <script type="text/javascript">cj(18,4);</script>He
wouldn’t for a while, but afterward he said to himself, ‘Though I
neither fear God, nor respect man, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,5);</script>yet because this widow bothers
me, I will defend her, or else she will wear me out by her continual
coming.’”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,6);</script>The Lord said, <span
class="j">“Listen to what the unrighteous judge says. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,7);</script>Won’t God avenge his chosen
ones, who are crying out to him day and night, and yet he exercises
patience with them? <script type="text/javascript">cj(18,8);</script>I
tell you that he will avenge them quickly. Nevertheless, when the Son of
Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,9);</script>He spoke also this
parable to certain people who were convinced of their own righteousness,
and who despised all others. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,10);</script><span class="j">“Two men went
up into the temple to pray; one was a Pharisee, and the other was a tax
collector. <script type="text/javascript">cj(18,11);</script>The Pharisee
stood and prayed to himself like this: ‘God, I thank you, that I am not
like the rest of men, extortioners, unrighteous, adulterers, or even like
this tax collector. <script type="text/javascript">cj(18,12);</script>I
fast twice a week. I give tithes of all that I get.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,13);</script>But the tax collector, standing
far away, wouldn’t even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast,
saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner!’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,14);</script>I tell you, this man went down
to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts
himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be
exalted.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,15);</script>They were also
bringing their babies to him, that he might touch them. But when the
disciples saw it, they rebuked them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,16);</script>Jesus summoned them, saying,
<span class="j">“Allow the little children to come to me, and don’t
hinder them, for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,17);</script>Most certainly, I tell you,
whoever doesn’t receive the Kingdom of God like a little child, he will
in no way enter into it.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,18);</script>A certain ruler asked
him, saying, “Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,19);</script>Jesus asked him,
<span class="j">“Why do you call me good? No one is good, except
one—God. <script type="text/javascript">cj(18,20);</script>You know the
commandments: ‘Don’t commit adultery,’ ‘Don’t murder,’
‘Don’t steal,’ ‘Don’t give false testimony,’ ‘Honor your
father and your mother.’”</span><font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,21);</script>He said, “I have
observed all these things from my youth up.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,22);</script>When Jesus heard
these things, he said to him, <span class="j">“You still lack one thing.
Sell all that you have, and distribute it to the poor. You will have
treasure in heaven. Come, follow me.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,23);</script>But when he heard
these things, he became very sad, for he was very rich.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,24);</script>Jesus, seeing that he
became very sad, said, <span class="j">“How hard it is for those who
have riches to enter into the Kingdom of God! <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,25);</script>For it is easier for a camel to
enter in through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the
Kingdom of God.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,26);</script>Those who heard it
said, “Then who can be saved?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,27);</script>But he said, <span
class="j">“The things which are impossible with men are possible with
God.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,28);</script>Peter said, “Look,
we have left everything, and followed you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,29);</script>He said to them,
<span class="j">“Most certainly I tell you, there is no one who has left
house, or wife, or brothers, or parents, or children, for the Kingdom of
God’s sake, <script type="text/javascript">cj(18,30);</script>who will
not receive many times more in this time, and in the world to come,
eternal life.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,31);</script>He took the twelve
aside, and said to them, <span class="j">“Behold, we are going up to
Jerusalem, and all the things that are written through the prophets
concerning the Son of Man will be completed. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,32);</script>For he will be delivered up to
the Gentiles, will be mocked, treated shamefully, and spit on. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,33);</script>They will scourge and kill him.
On the third day, he will rise again.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,34);</script>They understood none
of these things. This saying was hidden from them, and they didn’t
understand the things that were said. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,35);</script>It happened, as he came near
Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the road, begging. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,36);</script>Hearing a multitude going by, he
asked what this meant. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,37);</script>They told him that Jesus of
Nazareth was passing by. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,38);</script>He cried out, “Jesus, you son
of David, have mercy on me!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,39);</script>Those who led the way rebuked
him, that he should be quiet; but he cried out all the more, “You son of
David, have mercy on me!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,40);</script>Standing still, Jesus
commanded him to be brought to him. When he had come near, he asked him,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,41);</script><span class="j">“What
do you want me to do?”</span>
<p>He said, “Lord, that I may see again.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,42);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“Receive your sight. Your faith has healed you.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,43);</script>Immediately he
received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God. All the people, when
they saw it, praised God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,1);</script>He entered and was
passing through Jericho. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,2);</script>There was a man named Zacchaeus.
He was a chief tax collector, and he was rich. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,3);</script>He was trying to see who Jesus
was, and couldn’t because of the crowd, because he was short. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,4);</script>He ran on ahead, and climbed up
into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was to pass that way. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,5);</script>When Jesus came to the place, he
looked up and saw him, and said to him, <span class="j">“Zacchaeus,
hurry and come down, for today I must stay at your house.”</span>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(19,6);</script>He hurried, came down,
and received him joyfully. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,7);</script>When they saw it, they all
murmured, saying, “He has gone in to lodge with a man who is a sinner.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,8);</script>Zacchaeus stood and
said to the Lord, “Behold, Lord, half of my goods I give to the poor. If
I have wrongfully exacted anything of anyone, I restore four times as
much.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,9);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“Today, salvation has come to this house, because he
also is a son of Abraham. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(19,10);</script>For the Son of Man came to seek
and to save that which was lost.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,11);</script>As they heard these
things, he went on and told a parable, because he was near Jerusalem, and
they supposed that the Kingdom of God would be revealed immediately.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(19,12);</script>He said therefore, <span
class="j">“A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for
himself a kingdom, and to return. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(19,13);</script>He called ten servants of his,
and gave them <a href="#N44">ten mina coins,</a> and told them, ‘Conduct
business until I come.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(19,14);</script>But his citizens hated him, and
sent an envoy after him, saying, ‘We don’t want this man to reign over
us.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(19,15);</script>“It happened when he had come
back again, having received the kingdom, that he commanded these servants,
to whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know
what they had gained by conducting business. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(19,16);</script>The first came before him,
saying, ‘Lord, your mina has made ten more minas.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(19,17);</script>“He said to him, ‘Well done,
you good servant! Because you were found faithful with very little, you
shall have authority over ten cities.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(19,18);</script>“The second came, saying,
‘Your mina, Lord, has made five minas.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(19,19);</script>“So he said to him, ‘And you
are to be over five cities.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(19,20);</script>Another came, saying, ‘Lord,
behold, your mina, which I kept laid away in a handkerchief, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(19,21);</script>for I feared you, because you
are an exacting man. You take up that which you didn’t lay down, and
reap that which you didn’t sow.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(19,22);</script>“He said to him, ‘Out of
your own mouth will I judge you, you wicked servant! You knew that I am an
exacting man, taking up that which I didn’t lay down, and reaping that
which I didn’t sow. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(19,23);</script>Then why didn’t you deposit my
money in the bank, and at my coming, I might have earned interest on
it?’ <script type="text/javascript">cj(19,24);</script>He said to those
who stood by, ‘Take the mina away from him, and give it to him who has
the ten minas.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(19,25);</script>“They said to him, ‘Lord, he
has ten minas!’ <script type="text/javascript">cj(19,26);</script>‘For
I tell you that to everyone who has, will more be given; but from him who
doesn’t have, even that which he has will be taken away from him.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(19,27);</script>But bring those enemies
of mine who didn’t want me to reign over them here, and kill them before
me.’”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,28);</script>Having
said these things, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,29);</script>It happened, when he
drew near to <a href="#N45">Bethsphage</a> and Bethany, at the mountain
that is called Olivet, he sent two of his disciples, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,30);</script>saying, <span class="j">“Go
your way into the village on the other side, in which, as you enter, you
will find a colt tied, whereon no man ever yet sat. Untie it, and bring
it. <script type="text/javascript">cj(19,31);</script>If anyone asks you,
‘Why are you untying it?’ say to him: ‘The Lord needs
it.’”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,32);</script>Those who were sent
went away, and found things just as he had told them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,33);</script>As they were untying the colt,
its owners said to them, “Why are you untying the colt?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,34);</script>They said, “The Lord needs
it.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,35);</script>They brought it
to Jesus. They threw their cloaks on the colt, and set Jesus on them.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(19,36);</script>As he went, they spread
their cloaks in the way. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,37);</script>As he was now getting near, at
the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples
began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works
which they had seen, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,38);</script>saying, “Blessed is the King
who comes in the name of the Lord!<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N46">*</a></sup></font> Peace in heaven, and glory in the
highest!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,39);</script>Some of the Pharisees
from the multitude said to him, “Teacher, rebuke your disciples!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,40);</script>He answered them,
<span class="j">“I tell you that if these were silent, the stones would
cry out.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,41);</script>When he drew near, he
saw the city and wept over it, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,42);</script>saying, <span class="j">“If
you, even you, had known today the things which belong to your peace! But
now, they are hidden from your eyes. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(19,43);</script>For the days will come on you,
when your enemies will throw up a barricade against you, surround you, hem
you in on every side, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(19,44);</script>and will dash you and your
children within you to the ground. They will not leave in you one stone on
another, because you didn’t know the time of your visitation.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,45);</script>He entered into the
temple, and began to drive out those who bought and sold in it, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,46);</script>saying to them, <span
class="j">“It is written, ‘My house is a house of prayer,’<font

might do, for all the people hung on to every word that he said.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,1);</script>It happened on one of
those days, as he was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the
Good News, that the <font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a

elders. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,2);</script>They asked him,
“Tell us: by what authority do you do these things? Or who is giving you
this authority?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,3);</script>He answered them,
<span class="j">“I also will ask you one question. Tell me: <script
type="text/javascript">cj(20,4);</script>the baptism of John, was it from
heaven, or from men?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,5);</script>They reasoned with
themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Why
didn’t you believe him?’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,6);</script>But if we say, ‘From men,’
all the people will stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a
prophet.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,7);</script>They answered
that they didn’t know where it was from.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,8);</script>Jesus said to them,
<span class="j">“Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these
things.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,9);</script>He began to tell the
people this parable. <span class="j">“A <font color="#0000ff"

rented it out to some farmers, and went into another country for a long
time. <script type="text/javascript">cj(20,10);</script>At the proper
season, he sent a servant to the farmers to collect his share of the fruit
of the vineyard. But the farmers beat him, and sent him away empty.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(20,11);</script>He sent yet another
servant, and they also beat him, and treated him shamefully, and sent him
away empty. <script type="text/javascript">cj(20,12);</script>He sent yet
a third, and they also wounded him, and threw him out. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(20,13);</script>The lord of the vineyard said,
‘What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. It may be that seeing him,
they will respect him.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script

they reasoned among themselves, saying, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s
kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.’ <script

vineyard, and killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do
to them? <script type="text/javascript">cj(20,16);</script>He will come
and destroy these farmers, and will give the vineyard to others.”</span>
<p>When they heard it, they said, “May it never be!”

spies, who pretended to be righteous, that they might trap him in
something he said, so as to deliver him up to the power and authority of
the governor. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,21);</script>They asked
him, “Teacher, we know that you say and teach what is right, and
aren’t partial to anyone, but truly teach the way of God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,22);</script>Is it lawful for us to pay taxes
to Caesar, or not?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,23);</script>But he perceived
their craftiness, and said to them, <span class="j">“Why do you test me?
<script type="text/javascript">cj(20,24);</script>Show me a denarius.
Whose image and inscription are on it?”</span>
<p>They answered, “Caesar’s.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,25);</script>He said to them,
<span class="j">“Then give to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and
to God the things that are God’s.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,26);</script>They weren’t able
to trap him in his words before the people. They marveled at his answer,
and were silent. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,27);</script>Some of
the Sadducees came to him, those who deny that there is a resurrection.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(20,28);</script>They asked him,
“Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if a man’s brother dies having a
wife, and he is childless, his brother should take the wife, and raise up
children for his brother. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,29);</script>There were therefore seven
brothers. The first took a wife, and died childless. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,30);</script>The second took her as wife, and
he died childless. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,31);</script>The
third took her, and likewise the seven all left no children, and died.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(20,32);</script>Afterward the woman also
died. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,33);</script>Therefore in the
resurrection whose wife of them will she be? For the seven had her as a
wife.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,34);</script>Jesus said to them,
<span class="j">“The children of this age marry, and are given in
marriage. <script type="text/javascript">cj(20,35);</script>But those who
are considered worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the
dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(20,36);</script>For they can’t die any more,
for they are like the angels, and are children of God, being children of
the resurrection. <script type="text/javascript">cj(20,37);</script>But
that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the bush, when he called
the Lord ‘The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of
Jacob.’<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N52">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cj(20,38);</script>Now he is not the God of the
dead, but of the living, for all are alive to him.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,39);</script>Some of the scribes
answered, “Teacher, you speak well.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,40);</script>They didn’t dare to ask him
any more questions.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,41);</script>He said to them,
<span class="j">“Why do they say that the Christ is David’s son?
<script type="text/javascript">cj(20,42);</script>David himself says in
the book of Psalms,</span>
<dl><span class="j">
<dt>‘The Lord said to my Lord,
<dd>“Sit at my right hand,
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cj(20,43);</script>until I make your
enemies the footstool of your feet.”’<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N53">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(20,44);</script>“David therefore calls him
Lord, so how is he his son?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,45);</script>In the hearing of all
the people, he said to his disciples, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,46);</script><span class="j">“Beware of the
scribes, who like to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the
marketplaces, the best seats in the synagogues, and the best places at
feasts; <script type="text/javascript">cj(20,47);</script>who devour
widows’ houses, and for a pretense make long prayers: these will receive
greater condemnation.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,1);</script>He looked up, and saw
the rich people who were putting their gifts into the treasury. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,2);</script>He saw a certain poor widow
casting in <a href="#N54">two small brass coins.</a> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,3);</script>He said, <span class="j">“Truly
I tell you, this poor widow put in more than all of them, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(21,4);</script>for all these put in gifts for
God from their abundance, but she, out of her poverty, put in all that she
had to live on.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,5);</script>As some were talking
about the temple and how it was decorated with beautiful stones and gifts,
he said, <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,6);</script><span
class="j">“As for these things which you see, the days will come, in
which there will not be left here one stone on another that will not be
thrown down.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,7);</script>They asked him,
“Teacher, so when will these things be? What is the sign that these
things are about to happen?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,8);</script>He said, <span
class="j">“Watch out that you don’t get led astray, for many will come
in my name, saying, ‘<a href="#N55">I am he</a>,’ and, ‘The time is
at hand.’ Therefore don’t follow them. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(21,9);</script>When you hear of wars and
disturbances, don’t be terrified, for these things must happen first,
but the end won’t come immediately.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,10);</script>Then he said to them,
<span class="j">“Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against
kingdom. <script type="text/javascript">cj(21,11);</script>There will be
great earthquakes, famines, and plagues in various places. There will be
terrors and great signs from heaven. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(21,12);</script>But before all these things,
they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you, delivering you up
to synagogues and prisons, bringing you before kings and governors for my
name’s sake. <script type="text/javascript">cj(21,13);</script>It will
turn out as a testimony for you. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(21,14);</script>Settle it therefore in your
hearts not to meditate beforehand how to answer, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(21,15);</script>for I will give you a mouth and
wisdom which all your adversaries will not be able to withstand or to
contradict. <script type="text/javascript">cj(21,16);</script>You will be
handed over even by parents, brothers, relatives, and friends. They will
cause some of you to be put to death. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(21,17);</script>You will be hated by all men for
my name’s sake. <script type="text/javascript">cj(21,18);</script>And
not a hair of your head will perish.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(21,19);</script>“By your endurance you will
win your lives.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(21,20);</script>“But when you see Jerusalem
surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation is at hand. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(21,21);</script>Then let those who are in Judea
flee to the mountains. Let those who are in the midst of her depart. Let
those who are in the country not enter therein. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(21,22);</script>For these are days of vengeance,
that all things which are written may be fulfilled. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(21,23);</script>Woe to those who are pregnant
and to those who nurse infants in those days! For there will be great
distress in the land, and wrath to this people. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(21,24);</script>They will fall by the edge of
the sword, and will be led captive into all the nations. Jerusalem will be
trampled down by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are
fulfilled. <script type="text/javascript">cj(21,25);</script>There will be
signs in the sun, moon, and stars; and on the earth anxiety of nations, in
perplexity for the roaring of the sea and the waves; <script
type="text/javascript">cj(21,26);</script>men fainting for fear, and for
expectation of the things which are coming on the world: for the powers of
the heavens will be shaken. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(21,27);</script>Then they will see the Son of
Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(21,28);</script>But when these things begin to
happen, look up, and lift up your heads, because your redemption is
near.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,29);</script>He told them a
parable. <span class="j">“See the fig tree, and all the trees. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(21,30);</script>When they are already budding,
you see it and know by your own selves that the summer is already near.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(21,31);</script>Even so you also, when
you see these things happening, know that the Kingdom of God is near.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(21,32);</script>Most certainly I tell
you, this generation will not pass away until all things are accomplished.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(21,33);</script>Heaven and earth will
pass away, but my words will by no means pass away.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(21,34);</script>“So be careful, or your hearts
will be loaded down with carousing, drunkenness, and cares of this life,
and that day will come on you suddenly. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(21,35);</script>For it will come like a snare on
all those who dwell on the surface of all the earth. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(21,36);</script>Therefore be watchful all the
time, praying that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things
that will happen, and to stand before the Son of Man.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,37);</script>Every day Jesus was
teaching in the temple, and every night he would go out and spend the
night on the mountain that is called Olivet. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,38);</script>All the people came early in the
morning to him in the temple to hear him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,1);</script>Now the feast of
unleavened bread, which is called the Passover, drew near. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,2);</script>The chief priests and the scribes
sought how they might put him to death, for they feared the people.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(22,3);</script>Satan entered into Judas,
who was surnamed Iscariot, who was numbered with the twelve. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,4);</script>He went away, and talked with the
chief priests and captains about how he might deliver him to them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,5);</script>They were glad, and agreed to
give him money. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,6);</script>He
consented, and sought an opportunity to deliver him to them in the absence
of the multitude. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,7);</script>The day
of unleavened bread came, on which the Passover must be sacrificed.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(22,8);</script>He sent Peter and John,
saying, <span class="j">“Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may
eat.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,9);</script>They said to him,
“Where do you want us to prepare?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,10);</script>He said to them,
<span class="j">“Behold, when you have entered into the city, a man
carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him into the house which
he enters. <script type="text/javascript">cj(22,11);</script>Tell the
master of the house, ‘The Teacher says to you, “Where is the guest
room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?”’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(22,12);</script>He will show you a large,
furnished upper room. Make preparations there.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,13);</script>They went, found
things as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,14);</script>When the hour had come, he sat
down with the twelve apostles. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,15);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before
I suffer, <script type="text/javascript">cj(22,16);</script>for I tell
you, I will no longer by any means eat of it until it is fulfilled in the
Kingdom of God.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,17);</script>He received a cup, and when he
had given thanks, he said, <span class="j">“Take this, and share it
among yourselves, <script type="text/javascript">cj(22,18);</script>for I
tell you, I will not drink at all again from the fruit of the vine, until
the Kingdom of God comes.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,19);</script>He took bread, and
when he had given thanks, he broke it, and gave to them, saying, <span
class="j">“This is my body which is given for you. Do this in memory of
me.”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,20);</script>Likewise,
he took the cup after supper, saying, <span class="j">“This cup is the
new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(22,21);</script>But behold, the hand of him who
betrays me is with me on the table. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(22,22);</script>The Son of Man indeed goes, as
it has been determined, but woe to that man through whom he is
betrayed!”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,23);</script>They began to
question among themselves, which of them it was who would do this thing.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(22,24);</script>There arose also a
contention among them, which of them was considered to be greatest.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(22,25);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“The kings of the nations lord it over them, and those who
have authority over them are called ‘benefactors.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(22,26);</script>But not so with you. But one who
is the greater among you, let him become as the younger, and one who is
governing, as one who serves. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(22,27);</script>For who is greater, one who sits
at the table, or one who serves? Isn’t it he who sits at the table? But
I am in the midst of you as one who serves. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(22,28);</script>But you are those who have
continued with me in my trials. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(22,29);</script>I confer on you a kingdom, even
as my Father conferred on me, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(22,30);</script>that you may eat and drink at my
table in my Kingdom. You will sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of
Israel.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,31);</script>The Lord said, <span
class="j">“Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked to have you, that he might
sift you as wheat, <script type="text/javascript">cj(22,32);</script>but I
prayed for you, that your faith wouldn’t fail. You, when once you have
turned again, establish your <a href="#N56">brothers</a>.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,33);</script>He said to him,
“Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,34);</script>He said, <span
class="j">“I tell you, Peter, the rooster will by no means crow today
until you deny that you know me three times.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,35);</script>He said to them,
<span class="j">“When I sent you out without purse, and wallet, and
shoes, did you lack anything?”</span>
<p>They said, “Nothing.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,36);</script>Then he said to them,
<span class="j">“But now, whoever has a purse, let him take it, and
likewise a wallet. Whoever has none, let him sell his cloak, and buy a
sword. <script type="text/javascript">cj(22,37);</script>For I tell you
that this which is written must still be fulfilled in me: ‘He was
counted with transgressors.’<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N57">*</a></sup></font> For that which concerns me has an
end.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,38);</script>They said, “Lord,
behold, here are two swords.”
<p>He said to them, <span class="j">“That is enough.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,39);</script>He came out, and
went, as his custom was, to the Mount of Olives. His disciples also
followed him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,40);</script>When he
was at the place, he said to them, <span class="j">“Pray that you
don’t enter into temptation.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,41);</script>He was withdrawn from
them about a stone’s throw, and he knelt down and prayed, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,42);</script>saying, <span
class="j">“Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me.
Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,43);</script>An angel from heaven
appeared to him, strengthening him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,44);</script>Being in agony he prayed more
earnestly. His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the
ground.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,45);</script>When he rose up from
his prayer, he came to the disciples, and found them sleeping because of
grief, <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,46);</script>and said to them,
<span class="j">“Why do you sleep? Rise and pray that you may not enter
into temptation.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,47);</script>While he was still
speaking, behold, a multitude, and he who was called Judas, one of the
twelve, was leading them. He came near to Jesus to kiss him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,48);</script>But Jesus said to him, <span
class="j">“Judas, do you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,49);</script>When those who were
around him saw what was about to happen, they said to him, “Lord, shall
we strike with the sword?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,50);</script>A certain one of them struck the
servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,51);</script>But Jesus answered,
<span class="j">“Let me at least do this”</span>—and he touched his
ear, and healed him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,52);</script>Jesus said to the chief priests,
captains of the temple, and elders, who had come against him, <span
class="j">“Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?
<script type="text/javascript">cj(22,53);</script>When I was with you in
the temple daily, you didn’t stretch out your hands against me. But this
is your hour, and the power of darkness.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,54);</script>They seized him, and
led him away, and brought him into the high priest’s house. But Peter
followed from a distance. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,55);</script>When they had kindled a fire in
the middle of the courtyard, and had sat down together, Peter sat among
them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,56);</script>A certain servant
girl saw him as he sat in the light, and looking intently at him, said,
“This man also was with him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,57);</script>He denied Jesus,
saying, “Woman, I don’t know him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,58);</script>After a little while
someone else saw him, and said, “You also are one of them!”
<p>But Peter answered, “Man, I am not!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,59);</script>After about one hour
passed, another confidently affirmed, saying, “Truly this man also was
with him, for he is a Galilean!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,60);</script>But Peter said,
“Man, I don’t know what you are talking about!” Immediately, while
he was still speaking, a rooster crowed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,61);</script>The Lord turned, and looked at
Peter. Then Peter remembered the Lord’s word, how he said to him, <span
class="j">“Before the rooster crows you will deny me three
times.”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,62);</script>He went
out, and wept bitterly.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,63);</script>The men who held
Jesus mocked him and beat him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,64);</script>Having blindfolded him, they
struck him on the face and asked him, “Prophesy! Who is the one who
struck you?” <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,65);</script>They
spoke many other things against him, insulting him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,66);</script>As soon as it was
day, the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together, both
chief priests and scribes, and they led him away into their council,
saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,67);</script>“If you are
the Christ, tell us.”
<p>But he said to them, <span class="j">“If I tell you, you won’t
believe, <script type="text/javascript">cj(22,68);</script>and if I ask,
you will in no way answer me or let me go. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(22,69);</script>From now on, the Son of Man will
be seated at the right hand of the power of God.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,70);</script>They all said, “Are
you then the Son of God?”
<p>He said to them, <span class="j">“You say it, because I am.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,71);</script>They said, “Why do
we need any more witness? For we ourselves have heard from his own
mouth!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,1);</script>The whole company of
them rose up and brought him before Pilate. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,2);</script>They began to accuse him, saying,
“We found this man perverting the nation, forbidding paying taxes to
Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, a king.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,3);</script>Pilate asked him,
“Are you the King of the Jews?”
<p>He answered him, <span class="j">“So you say.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,4);</script>Pilate said to the
chief priests and the multitudes, “I find no basis for a charge against
this man.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,5);</script>But they insisted,
saying, “He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea,
beginning from Galilee even to this place.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,6);</script>But when Pilate heard Galilee
mentioned, he asked if the man was a Galilean. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,7);</script>When he found out that he was in
Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem
during those days.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,8);</script>Now when Herod saw
Jesus, he was exceedingly glad, for he had wanted to see him for a long
time, because he had heard many things about him. He hoped to see some
miracle done by him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,9);</script>He
questioned him with many words, but he gave no answers. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,10);</script>The chief priests and the
scribes stood, vehemently accusing him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,11);</script>Herod with his soldiers
humiliated him and mocked him. Dressing him in luxurious clothing, they
sent him back to Pilate. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,12);</script>Herod and Pilate became friends
with each other that very day, for before that they were enemies with each
other.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,13);</script>Pilate called
together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,14);</script>and said to them, “You brought
this man to me as one that perverts the people, and see, I have examined
him before you, and found no basis for a charge against this man
concerning those things of which you accuse him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,15);</script>Neither has Herod, for I sent
you to him, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,16);</script>I will therefore chastise him
and release him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,17);</script>Now he had to release
one prisoner to them at the feast. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,18);</script>But they all cried out together,
saying, “Away with this man! Release to us Barabbas!”—<script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,19);</script>one who was thrown into prison
for a certain revolt in the city, and for murder.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,20);</script>Then Pilate spoke to
them again, wanting to release Jesus, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,21);</script>but they shouted, saying,
“Crucify! Crucify him!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,22);</script>He said to them the
third time, “Why? What evil has this man done? I have found no capital
crime in him. I will therefore chastise him and release him.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,23);</script>But they were urgent with loud
voices, asking that he might be crucified. Their voices and the voices of
the chief priests prevailed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,24);</script>Pilate decreed that what they
asked for should be done. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,25);</script>He released him who had been
thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but
he delivered Jesus up to their will.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,26);</script>When they led him
away, they grabbed one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid
on him the cross, to carry it after Jesus. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,27);</script>A great multitude of the people
followed him, including women who also mourned and lamented him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,28);</script>But Jesus, turning to them,
said, <span class="j">“Daughters of Jerusalem, don’t weep for me, but
weep for yourselves and for your children. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(23,29);</script>For behold, the days are coming
in which they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never
bore, and the breasts that never nursed.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(23,30);</script>Then they will begin to tell the
mountains, ‘Fall on us!’ and tell the hills, ‘Cover us.’<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N58">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cj(23,31);</script>For if they do these things in
the green tree, what will be done in the dry?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,32);</script>There were also
others, two criminals, led with him to be put to death. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,33);</script>When they came to the place that
is called The Skull, they crucified him there with the criminals, one on
the right and the other on the left.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,34);</script>Jesus said, <span
class="j">“Father, forgive them, for they don’t know what they are
doing.”</span>
<p>Dividing his garments among them, they cast lots. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,35);</script>The people stood watching. The
rulers with them also scoffed at him, saying, “He saved others. Let him
save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen one!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,36);</script>The soldiers also
mocked him, coming to him and offering him vinegar, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,37);</script>and saying, “If you are the
King of the Jews, save yourself!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,38);</script>An inscription was
also written over him in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew: “THIS IS
THE KING OF THE JEWS.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,39);</script>One of the criminals
who was hanged insulted him, saying, “If you are the Christ, save
yourself and us!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,40);</script>But the other
answered, and rebuking him said, “Don’t you even fear God, seeing you
are under the same condemnation? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,41);</script>And we indeed justly, for we
receive the due reward for our deeds, but this man has done nothing
wrong.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,42);</script>He said to
Jesus, “Lord, remember me when you come into your Kingdom.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,43);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“Assuredly I tell you, today you will be with me in
Paradise.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,44);</script>It was now <a
href="#N59">about the sixth hour</a>, and darkness came over the whole
land until <a href="#N60">the ninth hour.</a> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,45);</script>The sun was darkened, and the
veil of the temple was torn in two. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,46);</script>Jesus, crying with a loud voice,
said, <span class="j">“Father, into your hands I commit my
spirit!”</span> Having said this, he breathed his last.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,47);</script>When the centurion
saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, “Certainly this was a
righteous man.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,48);</script>All
the multitudes that came together to see this, when they saw the things
that were done, returned home beating their breasts. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,49);</script>All his acquaintances, and the
women who followed with him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching
these things.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,50);</script>Behold, a man named
Joseph, who was a member of the council, a good and righteous man <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,51);</script>(he had not consented to their
counsel and deed), from Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who was also
waiting for the Kingdom of God: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,52);</script>this man went to Pilate, and
asked for Jesus’ body. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,53);</script>He took it down, and wrapped it
in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone, where no
one had ever been laid. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,54);</script>It was the day of the
Preparation, and the Sabbath was drawing near. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,55);</script>The women, who had come with him
out of Galilee, followed after, and saw the tomb, and how his body was
laid. <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,56);</script>They returned, and
prepared spices and ointments. On the Sabbath they rested according to the
commandment.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,1);</script>But on the first day
of the week, at early dawn, they and some others came to the tomb,
bringing the spices which they had prepared. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,2);</script>They found the stone rolled away
from the tomb. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,3);</script>They
entered in, and didn’t find the Lord Jesus’ body. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,4);</script>It happened, while they were
greatly perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling
clothing. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,5);</script>Becoming
terrified, they bowed their faces down to the earth.
<p>They said to them, “Why do you seek the living among the dead?
<script type="text/javascript">cb(24,6);</script>He isn’t here, but is
risen. Remember what he told you when he was still in Galilee, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,7);</script>saying that the Son of Man must
be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the
third day rise again?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,8);</script>They remembered his
words, <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,9);</script>returned from the
tomb, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(24,10);</script>Now they were Mary
Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary the mother of James. The other women with them
told these things to the apostles. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,11);</script>These words seemed to them to be
nonsense, and they didn’t believe them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,12);</script>But Peter got up and ran to the
tomb. Stooping and looking in, he saw the strips of linen lying by
themselves, and he departed to his home, wondering what had happened.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,13);</script>Behold, two of them
were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was <a
href="#N61">sixty stadia</a> from Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,14);</script>They talked with each other
about all of these things which had happened. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,15);</script>It happened, while they talked
and questioned together, that Jesus himself came near, and went with them.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(24,16);</script>But their eyes were kept
from recognizing him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,17);</script>He
said to them, <span class="j">“What are you talking about as you walk,
and are sad?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,18);</script>One of them, named
Cleopas, answered him, “Are you the only stranger in Jerusalem who
doesn’t know the things which have happened there in these days?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,19);</script>He said to them,
<span class="j">“What things?”</span>
<p>They said to him, “The things concerning Jesus, the Nazarene, who was
a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,20);</script>and how the chief priests and
our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(24,21);</script>But we were hoping that
it was he who would redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now
the third day since these things happened. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,22);</script>Also, certain women of our
company amazed us, having arrived early at the tomb; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,23);</script>and when they didn’t find his
body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, who
said that he was alive. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,24);</script>Some of us went to the tomb, and
found it just like the women had said, but they didn’t see him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,25);</script>He said to them,
<span class="j">“Foolish men, and slow of heart to believe in all that
the prophets have spoken! <script
type="text/javascript">cj(24,26);</script>Didn’t the Christ have to
suffer these things and to enter into his glory?”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,27);</script>Beginning from Moses and from
all the prophets, he explained to them in all the Scriptures the things
concerning himself. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,28);</script>They
drew near to the village, where they were going, and he acted like he
would go further.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,29);</script>They urged him,
saying, “Stay with us, for it is almost evening, and the day is almost
over.”
<p>He went in to stay with them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,30);</script>It happened, that when he had
sat down at the table with them, he took the bread and gave thanks.
Breaking it, he gave to them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,31);</script>Their eyes were opened, and they
recognized him, and he vanished out of their sight. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,32);</script>They said one to another,
“Weren’t our hearts burning within us, while he spoke to us along the
way, and while he opened the Scriptures to us?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,33);</script>They rose up that very hour,
returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and those
who were with them, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,34);</script>saying, “The Lord is risen
indeed, and has appeared to Simon!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,35);</script>They related the things that
happened along the way, and how he was recognized by them in the breaking
of the bread.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,36);</script>As they said these
things, Jesus himself stood among them, and said to them, <span
class="j">“Peace be to you.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,37);</script>But they were
terrified and filled with fear, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,38);</script>He said to them,
<span class="j">“Why are you troubled? Why do doubts arise in your
hearts? <script type="text/javascript">cj(24,39);</script>See my hands and
my feet, that it is truly me. Touch me and see, for a spirit doesn’t
have flesh and bones, as you see that I have.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,40);</script>When he had said this, he showed
them his hands and his feet. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,41);</script>While they still didn’t
believe for joy, and wondered, he said to them, <span class="j">“Do you
have anything here to eat?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,42);</script>They gave him a piece
of a broiled fish and some honeycomb. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,43);</script>He took them, and ate in front
of them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,44);</script>He said to
them, <span class="j">“This is what I told you, while I was still with
you, that all things which are written in the law of Moses, the prophets,
and the psalms, concerning me must be fulfilled.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,45);</script>Then he opened their
minds, that they might understand the Scriptures. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,46);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ
to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(24,47);</script>and that repentance and
remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations,
beginning at Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(24,48);</script>You are witnesses of these
things. <script type="text/javascript">cj(24,49);</script>Behold, I send
forth the promise of my Father on you. But wait in the city of Jerusalem
until you are clothed with power from on high.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,50);</script>He led them out as
far as Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,51);</script>It happened, while he blessed
them, that he withdrew from them, and was carried up into heaven. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,52);</script>They worshiped him, and returned
to Jerusalem with great joy, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,53);</script>and were continually in the
temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.

The Good News According to John
</h1><p>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,1);</script>In the beginning was the
Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,2);</script>The same was in the beginning with
God. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,3);</script>All things were made
through him. Without him was not anything made that has been made. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,4);</script>In him was life, and the life was
the light of men. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,5);</script>The
light shines in the darkness, and the darkness hasn’t <a
href="#N1">overcome</a> it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,6);</script>There came a man, sent from God,
whose name was John. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,7);</script>The
same came as a witness, that he might testify about the light, that all
might believe through him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,8);</script>He was not the light, but was sent
that he might testify about the light. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,9);</script>The true light that enlightens
everyone was coming into the world.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,10);</script>He was in the world,
and the world was made through him, and the world didn’t recognize him.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,11);</script>He came to his own, and
those who were his own didn’t receive him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,12);</script>But as many as received him, to
them he gave the right to become God’s children, to those who believe in
his name: <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,13);</script>who were born
not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of
God. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,14);</script>The Word became
flesh, and lived among us. We saw his glory, such glory as of the one and
only Son of the Father, full of grace and truth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,15);</script>John testified about him. He
cried out, saying, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me
has surpassed me, for he was before me.’” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,16);</script>From his fullness we all received
grace upon grace. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,17);</script>For the
law was given through Moses. Grace and truth were realized through Jesus
Christ. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,18);</script>No one has seen
God at any time. The one and only <a href="#N2">Son,</a> who is in the
bosom of the Father, he has declared him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,19);</script>This is John’s
testimony, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask
him, “Who are you?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,20);</script>He declared, and
didn’t deny, but he declared, “I am not the Christ.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,21);</script>They asked him,
“What then? Are you Elijah?”
<p>He said, “I am not.”
<p>“Are you the prophet?”
<p>He answered, “No.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,22);</script>They said therefore to
him, “Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us.
What do you say about yourself?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,23);</script>He said, “I am the
voice of one crying in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the
Lord,’<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N3">*</a></sup></font> as Isaiah the prophet said.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,24);</script>The ones who had been
sent were from the Pharisees. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,25);</script>They asked him, “Why then do
you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,26);</script>John answered them,
“I baptize in water, but among you stands one whom you don’t know.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,27);</script>He is the one who comes
after me, who is preferred before me, whose sandal strap I’m not worthy
to loosen.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,28);</script>These
things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,29);</script>The next day, he saw
Jesus coming to him, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away
the sin of the world! <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,30);</script>This is he of whom I said,
‘After me comes a man who is preferred before me, for he was before
me.’ <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,31);</script>I didn’t know
him, but for this reason I came baptizing in water: that he would be
revealed to Israel.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,32);</script>John testified, saying, “I have
seen the Spirit descending like a dove out of heaven, and it remained on
him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,33);</script>I didn’t recognize
him, but he who sent me to baptize in water, he said to me, ‘On whomever
you will see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he
who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,34);</script>I have seen, and have testified
that this is the Son of God.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,35);</script>Again, the next day,
John was standing with two of his disciples, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,36);</script>and he looked at Jesus as he
walked, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,37);</script>The two disciples heard him
speak, and they followed Jesus. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,38);</script>Jesus turned, and saw them
following, and said to them, <span class="j">“What are you looking
for?”</span>
<p>They said to him, “Rabbi” (which is to say, being interpreted,
Teacher), “where are you staying?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,39);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Come, and see.”</span>
<p>They came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that
day. It was about <a href="#N4">the tenth hour.</a> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,40);</script>One of the two who heard John,
and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,41);</script>He first found his own brother,
Simon, and said to him, “We have found the Messiah!” (which is, being
interpreted, <a href="#N5">Christ</a>). <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,42);</script>He brought him to Jesus. Jesus
looked at him, and said, <span class="j">“You are Simon the son of
Jonah. You shall be called Cephas”</span> (which is by interpretation,
Peter). <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,43);</script>On the next day,
he was determined to go out into Galilee, and he found Philip. Jesus said
to him, <span class="j">“Follow me.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,44);</script>Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of
the city of Andrew and Peter. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,45);</script>Philip found Nathanael, and said
to him, “We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets,
wrote: Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,46);</script>Nathanael said to him,
“Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?”
<p>Philip said to him, “Come and see.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,47);</script>Jesus saw Nathanael
coming to him, and said about him, <span class="j">“Behold, an Israelite
indeed, in whom is no deceit!”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,48);</script>Nathanael said to him,
“How do you know me?”
<p>Jesus answered him, <span class="j">“Before Philip called you, when
you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,49);</script>Nathanael answered
him, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are King of Israel!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,50);</script>Jesus answered him,
<span class="j">“Because I told you, ‘I saw you underneath the fig
tree,’ do you believe? You will see greater things than these!”</span>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,51);</script>He said to him, <span
class="j">“Most certainly, I tell you, hereafter you will see heaven
opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of
Man.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,1);</script>The third day, there
was a marriage in Cana of Galilee. Jesus’ mother was there. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,2);</script>Jesus also was invited, with his
disciples, to the marriage. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,3);</script>When the wine ran out, Jesus’
mother said to him, “They have no wine.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,4);</script>Jesus said to her,
<span class="j">“Woman, what does that have to do with you and me? My
hour has not yet come.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,5);</script>His mother said to the
servants, “Whatever he says to you, do it.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,6);</script>Now there were six water pots of
stone set there after the Jews’ way of purifying, containing <a
href="#N6">two or three metretes</a> apiece. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,7);</script>Jesus said to them, <span
class="j">“Fill the water pots with water.”</span> They filled them up
to the brim. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,8);</script>He said to
them, <span class="j">“Now draw some out, and take it to the ruler of
the feast.”</span> So they took it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,9);</script>When the ruler of the feast tasted
the water now become wine, and didn’t know where it came from (but the
servants who had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the feast called the
bridegroom, <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,10);</script>and said to
him, “Everyone serves the good wine first, and when the guests have
drunk freely, then that which is worse. You have kept the good wine until
now!” <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,11);</script>This beginning of
his signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and revealed his glory; and his
disciples believed in him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,12);</script>After this, he went
down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, his brothers, and his disciples;
and they stayed there a few days. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,13);</script>The Passover of the Jews was at
hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,14);</script>He found in the temple those who
sold oxen, sheep, and doves, and the changers of money sitting. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,15);</script>He made a whip of cords, and
threw all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured
out the changers’ money, and overthrew their tables. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,16);</script>To those who sold the doves, he
said, <span class="j">“Take these things out of here! Don’t make my
Father’s house a marketplace!”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,17);</script>His disciples remembered that it
was written, “Zeal for your house will eat me up.”<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N7">*</a></sup></font>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,18);</script>The Jews therefore
answered him, “What sign do you show us, seeing that you do these
things?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,19);</script>Jesus answered them,
<span class="j">“Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it
up.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,20);</script>The Jews therefore
said, “It took forty-six years to build this temple! Will you raise it
up in three days?” <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,21);</script>But
he spoke of the temple of his body. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,22);</script>When therefore he was raised from
the dead, his disciples remembered that he said this, and they believed
the Scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,23);</script>Now when he was in
Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in his name,
observing his signs which he did. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,24);</script>But Jesus didn’t trust himself
to them, because he knew everyone, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,25);</script>and because he didn’t need for
anyone to testify concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,1);</script>Now there was a man of
the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,2);</script>The same came to him by night, and
said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for
no one can do these signs that you do, unless God is with him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,3);</script>Jesus answered him,
<span class="j">“Most certainly, I tell you, unless one is born <a
href="#N8">anew,</a> he can’t see the Kingdom of God.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,4);</script>Nicodemus said to him,
“How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into
his mother’s womb, and be born?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,5);</script>Jesus answered, <span
class="j">“Most certainly I tell you, unless one is born of water and
spirit, he can’t enter into the Kingdom of God! <script
type="text/javascript">cj(3,6);</script>That which is born of the flesh is
flesh. That which is born of the Spirit is spirit. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(3,7);</script>Don’t marvel that I said to you,
‘You must be born anew.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(3,8);</script>The <a href="#N9">wind</a> blows
where it wants to, and you hear its sound, but don’t know where it comes
from and where it is going. So is everyone who is born of the
Spirit.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,9);</script>Nicodemus answered him,
“How can these things be?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,10);</script>Jesus answered him,
<span class="j">“Are you the teacher of Israel, and don’t understand
these things? <script type="text/javascript">cj(3,11);</script>Most
certainly I tell you, we speak that which we know, and testify of that
which we have seen, and you don’t receive our witness. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(3,12);</script>If I told you earthly things and
you don’t believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?
<script type="text/javascript">cj(3,13);</script>No one has ascended into
heaven, but he who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man, who is in
heaven. <script type="text/javascript">cj(3,14);</script>As Moses lifted
up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted
up, <script type="text/javascript">cj(3,15);</script>that whoever believes
in him should not perish, but have eternal life. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(3,16);</script>For God so loved the world, that
he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him should not
perish, but have eternal life. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(3,17);</script>For God didn’t send his Son
into the world to judge the world, but that the world should be saved
through him. <script type="text/javascript">cj(3,18);</script>He who
believes in him is not judged. He who doesn’t believe has been judged
already, because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son
of God. <script type="text/javascript">cj(3,19);</script>This is the
judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the
darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(3,20);</script>For everyone who does evil hates
the light, and doesn’t come to the light, lest his works would be
exposed. <script type="text/javascript">cj(3,21);</script>But he who does
the truth comes to the light, that his works may be revealed, that they
have been done in God.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,22);</script>After these things,
Jesus came with his disciples into the land of Judea. He stayed there with
them, and baptized. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,23);</script>John
also was baptizing in Enon near Salim, because there was much water there.
They came, and were baptized. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,24);</script>For John was not yet thrown into
prison. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,25);</script>There arose
therefore a questioning on the part of John’s disciples with some Jews
about purification. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,26);</script>They
came to John, and said to him, “Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the
Jordan, to whom you have testified, behold, the same baptizes, and
everyone is coming to him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,27);</script>John answered, “A
man can receive nothing, unless it has been given him from heaven. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,28);</script>You yourselves testify that I
said, ‘I am not the Christ,’ but, ‘I have been sent before him.’
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,29);</script>He who has the bride is
the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears
him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice. This, my joy,
therefore is made full. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,30);</script>He must increase, but I must
decrease. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,31);</script>He who comes
from above is above all. He who is from the earth belongs to the earth,
and speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,32);</script>What he has seen and heard, of
that he testifies; and no one receives his witness. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,33);</script>He who has received his witness
has set his seal to this, that God is true. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,34);</script>For he whom God has sent speaks
the words of God; for God gives the Spirit without measure. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,35);</script>The Father loves the Son, and has
given all things into his hand. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,36);</script>One who believes in the Son has
eternal life, but one who <a href="#N10">disobeys</a> the Son won’t see
life, but the wrath of God remains on him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,1);</script>Therefore when the Lord
knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more
disciples than John <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,2);</script>(although Jesus himself didn’t
baptize, but his disciples), <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,3);</script>he left Judea, and departed into
Galilee. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,4);</script>He needed to pass
through Samaria. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,5);</script>So he
came to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the parcel of ground that
Jacob gave to his son, Joseph. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,6);</script>Jacob’s well was there. Jesus
therefore, being tired from his journey, sat down by the well. It was
about <a href="#N11">the sixth hour</a>. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,7);</script>A woman of Samaria came to draw
water. Jesus said to her, <span class="j">“Give me a drink.”</span>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,8);</script>For his disciples had gone
away into the city to buy food.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,9);</script>The Samaritan woman
therefore said to him, “How is it that you, being a Jew, ask for a drink
from me, a Samaritan woman?” (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,10);</script>Jesus answered her,
<span class="j">“If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to
you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have
given you living water.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,11);</script>The woman said to him,
“Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. From where
then have you that living water? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,12);</script>Are you greater than our father,
Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, as did his children,
and his livestock?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,13);</script>Jesus answered her,
<span class="j">“Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again,
<script type="text/javascript">cj(4,14);</script>but whoever drinks of the
water that I will give him will never thirst again; but the water that I
will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal
life.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,15);</script>The woman said to him,
“Sir, give me this water, so that I don’t get thirsty, neither come
all the way here to draw.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,16);</script>Jesus said to her,
<span class="j">“Go, call your husband, and come here.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,17);</script>The woman answered,
“I have no husband.”
<p>Jesus said to her, <span class="j">“You said well, ‘I have no
husband,’ <script type="text/javascript">cj(4,18);</script>for you have
had five husbands; and he whom you now have is not your husband. This you
have said truly.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,19);</script>The woman said to him,
“Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,20);</script>Our fathers worshiped in this
mountain, and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where people
ought to worship.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,21);</script>Jesus said to her,
<span class="j">“Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when neither in this
mountain, nor in Jerusalem, will you worship the Father. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(4,22);</script>You worship that which you
don’t know. We worship that which we know; for salvation is from the
Jews. <script type="text/javascript">cj(4,23);</script>But the hour comes,
and now is, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit
and truth, for the Father seeks such to be his worshippers. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(4,24);</script>God is spirit, and those who
worship him must worship in spirit and truth.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,25);</script>The woman said to him,
“I know that Messiah comes,” (he who is called Christ). “When he has
come, he will declare to us all things.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,26);</script>Jesus said to her,
<span class="j">“I am he, the one who speaks to you.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,27);</script>At this, his disciples came. They
marveled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no one said, “What are
you looking for?” or, “Why do you speak with her?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,28);</script>So the woman left her water pot,
and went away into the city, and said to the people, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,29);</script>“Come, see a man who told me
everything that I did. Can this be the Christ?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,30);</script>They went out of the
city, and were coming to him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,31);</script>In the meanwhile, the disciples
urged him, saying, “Rabbi, eat.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,32);</script>But he said to them,
<span class="j">“I have food to eat that you don’t know
about.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,33);</script>The disciples
therefore said one to another, “Has anyone brought him something to
eat?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,34);</script>Jesus said to them,
<span class="j">“My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to
accomplish his work. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(4,35);</script>Don’t you say, ‘There are yet
four months until the harvest?’ Behold, I tell you, lift up your eyes,
and look at the fields, that they are white for harvest already. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(4,36);</script>He who reaps receives wages, and
gathers fruit to eternal life; that both he who sows and he who reaps may
rejoice together. <script type="text/javascript">cj(4,37);</script>For in
this the saying is true, ‘One sows, and another reaps.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(4,38);</script>I sent you to reap that for which
you haven’t labored. Others have labored, and you have entered into
their labor.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,39);</script>From that city many of
the Samaritans believed in him because of the word of the woman, who
testified, “He told me everything that I did.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,40);</script>So when the Samaritans came to
him, they begged him to stay with them. He stayed there two days. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,41);</script>Many more believed because of his
word. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,42);</script>They said to the
woman, “Now we believe, not because of your speaking; for we have heard
for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the
world.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,43);</script>After the two days he
went out from there and went into Galilee. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,44);</script>For Jesus himself testified that
a prophet has no honor in his own country. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,45);</script>So when he came into Galilee, the
Galileans received him, having seen all the things that he did in
Jerusalem at the feast, for they also went to the feast. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,46);</script>Jesus came therefore again to
Cana of Galilee, where he made the water into wine. There was a certain
nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,47);</script>When he heard that Jesus had come
out of Judea into Galilee, he went to him, and begged him that he would
come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,48);</script>Jesus therefore said to him,
<span class="j">“Unless you see signs and wonders, you will in no way
believe.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,49);</script>The nobleman said to
him, “Sir, come down before my child dies.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,50);</script>Jesus said to him, <span
class="j">“Go your way. Your son lives.”</span> The man believed the
word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,51);</script>As he was now going down, his
servants met him and reported, saying “Your child lives!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,52);</script>So he inquired of them the hour
when he began to get better. They said therefore to him, “Yesterday at
the <a href="#N12">seventh hour,</a> the fever left him.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,53);</script>So the father knew that it was at
that hour in which Jesus said to him, <span class="j">“Your son
lives.”</span> He believed, as did his whole house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,54);</script>This is again the second sign
that Jesus did, having come out of Judea into Galilee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,1);</script>After these things,
there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,2);</script>Now in Jerusalem by the sheep
gate, there is a pool, which is called in Hebrew, “Bethesda,” having
five porches. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,3);</script>In these lay
a great multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, or paralyzed,
waiting for the moving of the water; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,4);</script>for an angel went down at certain
times into the pool, and stirred up the water. Whoever stepped in first
after the stirring of the water was made whole of whatever disease he had.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(5,5);</script>A certain man was there,
who had been sick for thirty-eight years. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,6);</script>When Jesus saw him lying there,
and knew that he had been sick for a long time, he asked him, <span
class="j">“Do you want to be made well?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,7);</script>The sick man answered
him, “Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is
stirred up, but while I’m coming, another steps down before me.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,8);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“Arise, take up your mat, and walk.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,9);</script>Immediately, the man
was made well, and took up his mat and walked.
<p>Now it was the Sabbath on that day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,10);</script>So the Jews said to him who was
cured, “It is the Sabbath. It is not lawful for you to carry the mat.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,11);</script>He answered them,
“He who made me well, the same said to me, <span class="j">‘Take up
your mat, and walk.’</span>”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,12);</script>Then they asked him,
“Who is the man who said to you, <span class="j">‘Take up your mat,
and walk’</span>?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,13);</script>But he who was healed
didn’t know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, a crowd being in the
place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,14);</script>Afterward Jesus found
him in the temple, and said to him, <span class="j">“Behold, you are
made well. Sin no more, so that nothing worse happens to you.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,15);</script>The man went away, and
told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,16);</script>For this cause the Jews
persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill him, because he did these things on
the Sabbath. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,17);</script>But Jesus
answered them, <span class="j">“My Father is still working, so I am
working, too.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,18);</script>For this cause therefore the Jews
sought all the more to kill him, because he not only broke the Sabbath,
but also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,19);</script>Jesus therefore answered them,
<span class="j">“Most certainly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing of
himself, but what he sees the Father doing. For whatever things he does,
these the Son also does likewise. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,20);</script>For the Father has affection for
the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does. He will show him
greater works than these, that you may marvel. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,21);</script>For as the Father raises the dead
and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom he desires.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(5,22);</script>For the Father judges no
one, but he has given all judgment to the Son, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,23);</script>that all may honor the Son, even
as they honor the Father. He who doesn’t honor the Son doesn’t honor
the Father who sent him.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,24);</script>“Most certainly I tell you, he
who hears my word, and believes him who sent me, has eternal life, and
doesn’t come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(5,25);</script>Most certainly, I tell
you, the hour comes, and now is, when the dead will hear the Son of
God’s voice; and those who hear will live. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,26);</script>For as the Father has life in
himself, even so he gave to the Son also to have life in himself. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,27);</script>He also gave him authority to
execute judgment, because he is a son of man. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,28);</script>Don’t marvel at this, for the
hour comes, in which all that are in the tombs will hear his voice,
<script type="text/javascript">cj(5,29);</script>and will come out; those
who have done good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have done
evil, to the resurrection of judgment. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,30);</script>I can of myself do nothing. As I
hear, I judge, and my judgment is righteous; because I don’t seek my own
will, but the will of my Father who sent me.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,31);</script>“If I testify about myself, my
witness is not valid. <script type="text/javascript">cj(5,32);</script>It
is another who testifies about me. I know that the testimony which he
testifies about me is true. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,33);</script>You have sent to John, and he has
testified to the truth. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,34);</script>But the testimony which I receive
is not from man. However, I say these things that you may be saved.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(5,35);</script>He was the burning and
shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(5,36);</script>But the testimony which I
have is greater than that of John, for the works which the Father gave me
to accomplish, the very works that I do, testify about me, that the Father
has sent me. <script type="text/javascript">cj(5,37);</script>The Father
himself, who sent me, has testified about me. You have neither heard his
voice at any time, nor seen his form. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,38);</script>You don’t have his word living
in you; because you don’t believe him whom he sent.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,39);</script>“You search the Scriptures,
because you think that in them you have eternal life; and these are they
which testify about me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,40);</script>Yet you will not come to me, that
you may have life. <script type="text/javascript">cj(5,41);</script>I
don’t receive glory from men. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,42);</script>But I know you, that you don’t
have God’s love in yourselves. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,43);</script>I have come in my Father’s
name, and you don’t receive me. If another comes in his own name, you
will receive him. <script type="text/javascript">cj(5,44);</script>How can
you believe, who receive glory from one another, and you don’t seek the
glory that comes from the only God?
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,45);</script>“Don’t think that I will
accuse you to the Father. There is one who accuses you, even Moses, on
whom you have set your hope. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,46);</script>For if you believed Moses, you
would believe me; for he wrote about me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,47);</script>But if you don’t believe his
writings, how will you believe my words?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,1);</script>After these things,
Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee, which is also
called the Sea of Tiberias. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,2);</script>A great multitude followed him,
because they saw his signs which he did on those who were sick. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,3);</script>Jesus went up into the mountain,
and he sat there with his disciples. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,4);</script>Now the Passover, the feast of the
Jews, was at hand. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,5);</script>Jesus
therefore lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a great multitude was
coming to him, said to Philip, <span class="j">“Where are we to buy
bread, that these may eat?”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,6);</script>This he said to test him, for he
himself knew what he would do.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,7);</script>Philip answered him,
“Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that
everyone of them may receive a little.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,8);</script>One of his disciples,
Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said to him, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,9);</script>“There is a boy here who has
five barley loaves and two fish, but what are these among so many?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,10);</script>Jesus said, <span
class="j">“Have the people sit down.”</span> Now there was much grass
in that place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,11);</script>Jesus took the loaves; and having
given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to those
who were sitting down; likewise also of the fish as much as they desired.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(6,12);</script>When they were filled, he
said to his disciples, <span class="j">“Gather up the broken pieces
which are left over, that nothing be lost.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,13);</script>So they gathered them up, and
filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves,
which were left over by those who had eaten. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,14);</script>When therefore the people saw the
sign which Jesus did, they said, “This is truly the prophet who comes
into the world.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,15);</script>Jesus
therefore, perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force,
to make him king, withdrew again to the mountain by himself.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,16);</script>When evening came, his
disciples went down to the sea, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,17);</script>and they entered into the boat,
and were going over the sea to Capernaum. It was now dark, and Jesus had
not come to them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,18);</script>The sea
was tossed by a great wind blowing. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,19);</script>When therefore they had rowed
about <a href="#N13">twenty-five or thirty stadia,</a> they saw Jesus
walking on the sea,<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N14">*</a></sup></font> and drawing near to the boat; and they were
afraid. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,20);</script>But he said to
them, <span class="j">“<a href="#N15">It is I</a>. Don’t be
afraid.”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,21);</script>They
were willing therefore to receive him into the boat. Immediately the boat
was at the land where they were going.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,22);</script>On the next day, the
multitude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no
other boat there, except the one in which his disciples had embarked, and
that Jesus hadn’t entered with his disciples into the boat, but his
disciples had gone away alone. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,23);</script>However boats from Tiberias came
near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given
thanks. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,24);</script>When the
multitude therefore saw that Jesus wasn’t there, nor his disciples, they
themselves got into the boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(6,25);</script>When they found him on
the other side of the sea, they asked him, “Rabbi, when did you come
here?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,26);</script>Jesus answered them,
<span class="j">“Most certainly I tell you, you seek me, not because you
saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves, and were filled. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,27);</script>Don’t work for the food which
perishes, but for the food which remains to eternal life, which the Son of
Man will give to you. For God the Father has sealed him.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,28);</script>They said therefore to
him, “What must we do, that we may work the works of God?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,29);</script>Jesus answered them,
<span class="j">“This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom
he has sent.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,30);</script>They said therefore to
him, “What then do you do for a sign, that we may see, and believe you?
What work do you do? <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,31);</script>Our
fathers ate the manna in the wilderness. As it is written, ‘He gave them
bread out of <a href="#N16">heaven</a> to eat.’”<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N17">*</a></sup></font>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,32);</script>Jesus therefore said
to them, <span class="j">“Most certainly, I tell you, it wasn’t Moses
who gave you the bread out of heaven, but my Father gives you the true
bread out of heaven. <script type="text/javascript">cj(6,33);</script>For
the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven, and gives life to
the world.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,34);</script>They said therefore to
him, “Lord, always give us this bread.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,35);</script>Jesus said to them,
<span class="j">“I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will not be
hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,36);</script>But I told you that you have seen
me, and yet you don’t believe. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,37);</script>All those whom the Father gives
me will come to me. He who comes to me I will in no way throw out. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,38);</script>For I have come down from heaven,
not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,39);</script>This is the will of my Father who
sent me, that of all he has given to me I should lose nothing, but should
raise him up at the last day. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,40);</script>This is the will of the one who
sent me, that everyone who sees the Son, and believes in him, should have
eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,41);</script>The Jews therefore
murmured concerning him, because he said, <span class="j">“I am the
bread which came down out of heaven.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,42);</script>They said, “Isn’t this Jesus,
the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How then does he say,
<span class="j">‘I have come down out of heaven?’”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,43);</script>Therefore Jesus
answered them, <span class="j">“Don’t murmur among yourselves. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,44);</script>No one can come to me unless the
Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up in the last day.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(6,45);</script>It is written in the
prophets, ‘They will all be taught by God.’<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N18">*</a></sup></font> Therefore everyone who
hears from the Father, and has learned, comes to me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,46);</script>Not that anyone has seen the
Father, except he who is from God. He has seen the Father. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,47);</script>Most certainly, I tell you, he
who believes in me has eternal life. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,48);</script>I am the bread of life. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,49);</script>Your fathers ate the manna in the
wilderness, and they died. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,50);</script>This is the bread which comes
down out of heaven, that anyone may eat of it and not die. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,51);</script>I am the living bread which came
down out of heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever.
Yes, the bread which I will give for the life of the world is my
flesh.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,52);</script>The Jews therefore
contended with one another, saying, “How can this man give us his flesh
to eat?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,53);</script>Jesus therefore said
to them, <span class="j">“Most certainly I tell you, unless you eat the
flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you don’t have life in
yourselves. <script type="text/javascript">cj(6,54);</script>He who eats
my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at
the last day. <script type="text/javascript">cj(6,55);</script>For my
flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,56);</script>He who eats my flesh and drinks
my blood lives in me, and I in him. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,57);</script>As the living Father sent me, and
I live because of the Father; so he who feeds on me, he will also live
because of me. <script type="text/javascript">cj(6,58);</script>This is
the bread which came down out of heaven—not as our fathers ate the
manna, and died. He who eats this bread will live forever.”</span>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(6,59);</script>He said these things in
the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,60);</script>Therefore many of his
disciples, when they heard this, said, “This is a hard saying! Who can
listen to it?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,61);</script>But Jesus knowing in
himself that his disciples murmured at this, said to them, <span
class="j">“Does this cause you to stumble? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,62);</script>Then what if you would see the
Son of Man ascending to where he was before? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,63);</script>It is the spirit who gives life.
The flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit, and
are life. <script type="text/javascript">cj(6,64);</script>But there are
some of you who don’t believe.”</span> For Jesus knew from the
beginning who they were who didn’t believe, and who it was who would
betray him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,65);</script>He said,
<span class="j">“For this cause have I said to you that no one can come
to me, unless it is given to him by my Father.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,66);</script>At this, many of his
disciples went back, and walked no more with him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,67);</script>Jesus said therefore to the
twelve, <span class="j">“You don’t also want to go away, do
you?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,68);</script>Simon Peter answered
him, “Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(6,69);</script>We have come to believe
and know that you are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,70);</script>Jesus answered them,
<span class="j">“Didn’t I choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a
devil?”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,71);</script>Now he
spoke of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, for it was he who would betray
him, being one of the twelve.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,1);</script>After these things,
Jesus was walking in Galilee, for he wouldn’t walk in Judea, because the
Jews sought to kill him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,2);</script>Now the feast of the Jews, the
Feast of Booths, was at hand. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,3);</script>His brothers therefore said to
him, “Depart from here, and go into Judea, that your disciples also may
see your works which you do. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,4);</script>For no one does anything in
secret, and himself seeks to be known openly. If you do these things,
reveal yourself to the world.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,5);</script>For even his brothers didn’t
believe in him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,6);</script>Jesus therefore said to
them, <span class="j">“My time has not yet come, but your time is always
ready. <script type="text/javascript">cj(7,7);</script>The world can’t
hate you, but it hates me, because I testify about it, that its works are
evil. <script type="text/javascript">cj(7,8);</script>You go up to the
feast. I am not yet going up to this feast, because my time is not yet
fulfilled.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,9);</script>Having said these
things to them, he stayed in Galilee. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,10);</script>But when his brothers had gone up
to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly, but as it were in
secret. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,11);</script>The Jews
therefore sought him at the feast, and said, “Where is he?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,12);</script>There was much murmuring among
the multitudes concerning him. Some said, “He is a good man.” Others
said, “Not so, but he leads the multitude astray.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,13);</script>Yet no one spoke openly of him
for fear of the Jews. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,14);</script>But
when it was now the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and
taught. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,15);</script>The Jews
therefore marveled, saying, “How does this man know letters, having
never been educated?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,16);</script>Jesus therefore
answered them, <span class="j">“My teaching is not mine, but his who
sent me. <script type="text/javascript">cj(7,17);</script>If anyone
desires to do his will, he will know about the teaching, whether it is
from God, or if I am speaking from myself. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(7,18);</script>He who speaks from himself seeks
his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and
no unrighteousness is in him. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(7,19);</script>Didn’t Moses give you the law,
and yet none of you keeps the law? Why do you seek to kill me?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,20);</script>The multitude
answered, “You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,21);</script>Jesus answered them,
<span class="j">“I did one work, and you all marvel because of it.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(7,22);</script>Moses has given you
circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers), and on the
Sabbath you circumcise a boy. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(7,23);</script>If a boy receives circumcision on
the Sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with
me, because I made a man completely healthy on the Sabbath? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(7,24);</script>Don’t judge according to
appearance, but judge righteous judgment.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,25);</script>Therefore some of them
of Jerusalem said, “Isn’t this he whom they seek to kill? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,26);</script>Behold, he speaks openly, and
they say nothing to him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this
is truly the Christ? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,27);</script>However we know where this man
comes from, but when the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes
from.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,28);</script>Jesus therefore cried
out in the temple, teaching and saying, <span class="j">“You both know
me, and know where I am from. I have not come of myself, but he who sent
me is true, whom you don’t know. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(7,29);</script>I know him, because I am from
him, and he sent me.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,30);</script>They sought therefore
to take him; but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet
come. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,31);</script>But of the
multitude, many believed in him. They said, “When the Christ comes, he
won’t do more signs than those which this man has done, will he?”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,32);</script>The Pharisees heard the
multitude murmuring these things concerning him, and the chief priests and
the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,33);</script>Then Jesus said, <span
class="j">“I will be with you a little while longer, then I go to him
who sent me. <script type="text/javascript">cj(7,34);</script>You will
seek me, and won’t find me; and where I am, you can’t come.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,35);</script>The Jews therefore
said among themselves, “Where will this man go that we won’t find him?
Will he go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,36);</script>What is this word that he
said, <span class="j">‘You will seek me, and won’t find me; and where
I am, you can’t come’?</span>”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,37);</script>Now on the last and
greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, <span
class="j">“If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink! <script
type="text/javascript">cj(7,38);</script>He who believes in me, as the
Scripture has said, from within him will flow rivers of living
water.”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,39);</script>But he
said this about the Spirit, which those believing in him were to receive.
For the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus wasn’t yet
glorified.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,40);</script>Many of the multitude
therefore, when they heard these words, said, “This is truly the
prophet.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,41);</script>Others said,
“This is the Christ.” But some said, “What, does the Christ come out
of Galilee? <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,42);</script>Hasn’t the
Scripture said that the Christ comes of the seed of David,<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N19">*</a></sup></font> and from
Bethlehem,<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N20">*</a></sup></font> the village where David was?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,43);</script>So there arose a division in the
multitude because of him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,44);</script>Some of them would have arrested
him, but no one laid hands on him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,45);</script>The officers therefore came to
the chief priests and Pharisees, and they said to them, “Why didn’t
you bring him?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,46);</script>The officers answered,
“No man ever spoke like this man!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,47);</script>The Pharisees
therefore answered them, “You aren’t also led astray, are you? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,48);</script>Have any of the rulers believed
in him, or of the Pharisees? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,49);</script>But this multitude that doesn’t
know the law is accursed.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,50);</script>Nicodemus (he who came
to him by night, being one of them) said to them, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,51);</script>“Does our law judge a man,
unless it first hears from him personally and knows what he does?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,52);</script>They answered him,
“Are you also from Galilee? Search, and see that no prophet has arisen
out of Galilee.<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N21">*</a></sup></font>”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,53);</script>Everyone went to his
own house, <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,1);</script>but Jesus went
to the Mount of Olives. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,2);</script>Now very early in the morning, he
came again into the temple, and all the people came to him. He sat down,
and taught them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,3);</script>The
scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman taken in adultery. Having set
her in the midst, <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,4);</script>they
told him, “Teacher, we found this woman in adultery, in the very act.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,5);</script>Now in our law, Moses
commanded us to stone such.<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N22">*</a></sup></font> What then do you say about her?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,6);</script>They said this testing him, that
they might have something to accuse him of.
<p>But Jesus stooped down, and wrote on the ground with his finger.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,7);</script>But when they continued
asking him, he looked up and said to them, <span class="j">“He who is
without sin among you, let him throw the first stone at her.”</span>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,8);</script>Again he stooped down, and
with his finger wrote on the ground.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,9);</script>They, when they heard
it, being convicted by their conscience, went out one by one, beginning
from the oldest, even to the last. Jesus was left alone with the woman
where she was, in the middle. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,10);</script>Jesus, standing up, saw her and
said, <span class="j">“Woman, where are your accusers? Did no one
condemn you?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,11);</script>She said, “No one,
Lord.”
<p>Jesus said, <span class="j">“Neither do I condemn you. Go your way.
From now on, sin no more.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,12);</script>Again, therefore,
Jesus spoke to them, saying, <span class="j">“I am the light of the
world.<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N23">*</a></sup></font>
He who follows me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the light
of life.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,13);</script>The Pharisees
therefore said to him, “You testify about yourself. Your testimony is
not valid.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,14);</script>Jesus answered them,
<span class="j">“Even if I testify about myself, my testimony is true,
for I know where I came from, and where I am going; but you don’t know
where I came from, or where I am going. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,15);</script>You judge according to the flesh.
I judge no one. <script type="text/javascript">cj(8,16);</script>Even if I
do judge, my judgment is true, for I am not alone, but I am with the
Father who sent me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,17);</script>It’s also written in your law
that the testimony of two people is valid.<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N24">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,18);</script>I am one who testifies about
myself, and the Father who sent me testifies about me.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,19);</script>They said therefore to
him, “Where is your Father?”
<p>Jesus answered, <span class="j">“You know neither me, nor my Father.
If you knew me, you would know my Father also.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,20);</script>Jesus spoke these words in the
treasury, as he taught in the temple. Yet no one arrested him, because his
hour had not yet come. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,21);</script>Jesus said therefore again to
them, <span class="j">“I am going away, and you will seek me, and you
will die in your sins. Where I go, you can’t come.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,22);</script>The Jews therefore
said, “Will he kill himself, that he says, <span class="j">‘Where I am
going, you can’t come?’</span>”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,23);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“You are from beneath. I am from above. You are of this world.
I am not of this world. <script type="text/javascript">cj(8,24);</script>I
said therefore to you that you will die in your sins; for unless you
believe that <a href="#N25">I am</a> he, you will die in your
sins.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,25);</script>They said therefore to
him, “Who are you?”
<p>Jesus said to them, <span class="j">“Just what I have been saying to
you from the beginning. <script type="text/javascript">cj(8,26);</script>I
have many things to speak and to judge concerning you. However he who sent
me is true; and the things which I heard from him, these I say to the
world.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,27);</script>They didn’t
understand that he spoke to them about the Father. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,28);</script>Jesus therefore said to them,
<span class="j">“When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will
know that I am he, and I do nothing of myself, but as my Father taught me,
I say these things. <script type="text/javascript">cj(8,29);</script>He
who sent me is with me. The Father hasn’t left me alone, for I always do
the things that are pleasing to him.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,30);</script>As he spoke these
things, many believed in him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,31);</script>Jesus therefore said to those
Jews who had believed him, <span class="j">“If you remain in my word,
then you are truly my disciples. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,32);</script>You will know the truth, and the
truth will make you free.”</span><font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N26">*</a></sup></font>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,33);</script>They answered him,
“We are Abraham’s seed, and have never been in bondage to anyone. How
do you say, <span class="j">‘You will be made free?’</span>”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,34);</script>Jesus answered them,
<span class="j">“Most certainly I tell you, everyone who commits sin is
the bondservant of sin. <script type="text/javascript">cj(8,35);</script>A
bondservant doesn’t live in the house forever. A son remains forever.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(8,36);</script>If therefore the Son
makes you free, you will be free indeed. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,37);</script>I know that you are Abraham’s
seed, yet you seek to kill me, because my word finds no place in you.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(8,38);</script>I say the things which I
have seen with my Father; and you also do the things which you have seen
with your father.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,39);</script>They answered him,
“Our father is Abraham.”
<p>Jesus said to them, <span class="j">“If you were Abraham’s
children, you would do the works of Abraham. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,40);</script>But now you seek to kill me, a
man who has told you the truth, which I heard from God. Abraham didn’t
do this. <script type="text/javascript">cj(8,41);</script>You do the works
of your father.”</span>
<p>They said to him, “We were not born of sexual immorality. We have one
Father, God.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,42);</script>Therefore Jesus said
to them, <span class="j">“If God were your father, you would love me,
for I came out and have come from God. For I haven’t come of myself, but
he sent me. <script type="text/javascript">cj(8,43);</script>Why don’t
you understand my speech? Because you can’t hear my word. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,44);</script>You are of your father, the
devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer
from the beginning, and doesn’t stand in the truth, because there is no
truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks on his own; for he is a
liar, and its father. <script type="text/javascript">cj(8,45);</script>But
because I tell the truth, you don’t believe me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,46);</script>Which of you convicts me of sin?
If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,47);</script>He who is of God hears the words
of God. For this cause you don’t hear, because you are not of
God.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,48);</script>Then the Jews answered
him, “Don’t we say well that you are a Samaritan, and have a demon?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,49);</script>Jesus answered, <span
class="j">“I don’t have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you
dishonor me. <script type="text/javascript">cj(8,50);</script>But I
don’t seek my own glory. There is one who seeks and judges. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,51);</script>Most certainly, I tell you, if a
person keeps my word, he will never see death.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,52);</script>Then the Jews said to
him, “Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets;
and you say, <span class="j">‘If a man keeps my word, he will never
taste of death.’</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,53);</script>Are you greater than our father,
Abraham, who died? The prophets died. Who do you make yourself out to
be?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,54);</script>Jesus answered, <span
class="j">“If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who
glorifies me, of whom you say that he is our God. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,55);</script>You have not known him, but I
know him. If I said, ‘I don’t know him,’ I would be like you, a
liar. But I know him, and keep his word. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,56);</script>Your father Abraham rejoiced to
see my day. He saw it, and was glad.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,57);</script>The Jews therefore
said to him, “You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen
Abraham?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,58);</script>Jesus said to them,
<span class="j">“Most certainly, I tell you, before Abraham came into
existence, <a href="#N27">I AM.</a>”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,59);</script>Therefore they took up
stones to throw at him, but Jesus was hidden, and went out of the temple,
having gone through their midst, and so passed by.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,1);</script>As he passed by, he saw
a man blind from birth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,2);</script>His disciples asked him, “Rabbi,
who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,3);</script>Jesus answered, <span
class="j">“Neither did this man sin, nor his parents; but, that the
works of God might be revealed in him. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(9,4);</script>I must work the works of him who
sent me, while it is day. The night is coming, when no one can work.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(9,5);</script>While I am in the world, I
am the light of the world.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,6);</script>When he had said this, he spat on
the ground, made mud with the saliva, anointed the blind man’s eyes with
the mud, <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,7);</script>and said to him,
<span class="j">“Go, wash in the pool of Siloam”</span> (which means
“Sent”). So he went away, washed, and came back seeing. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,8);</script>The neighbors therefore, and those
who saw that he was blind before, said, “Isn’t this he who sat and
begged?” <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,9);</script>Others were
saying, “It is he.” Still others were saying, “He looks like him.”
<p>He said, “I am he.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,10);</script>They therefore were asking him,
“How were your eyes opened?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,11);</script>He answered, “A man
called Jesus made mud, anointed my eyes, and said to me, <span
class="j">‘Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash.’</span> So I went away
and washed, and I received sight.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,12);</script>Then they asked him,
“Where is he?”
<p>He said, “I don’t know.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,13);</script>They brought him who
had been blind to the Pharisees. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,14);</script>It was a Sabbath when Jesus made
the mud and opened his eyes. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,15);</script>Again therefore the Pharisees
also asked him how he received his sight. He said to them, “He put mud
on my eyes, I washed, and I see.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,16);</script>Some therefore of the
Pharisees said, “This man is not from God, because he doesn’t keep the
Sabbath.” Others said, “How can a man who is a sinner do such
signs?” There was division among them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,17);</script>Therefore they asked the blind
man again, “What do you say about him, because he opened your eyes?”
<p>He said, “He is a prophet.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,18);</script>The Jews therefore did
not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his
sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,19);</script>and asked them, “Is
this your son, whom you say was born blind? How then does he now see?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,20);</script>His parents answered
them, “We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,21);</script>but how he now sees, we don’t
know; or who opened his eyes, we don’t know. He is of age. Ask him. He
will speak for himself.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,22);</script>His parents said these things
because they feared the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if any
man would confess him as Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,23);</script>Therefore his parents
said, “He is of age. Ask him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,24);</script>So they called the man
who was blind a second time, and said to him, “Give glory to God. We
know that this man is a sinner.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,25);</script>He therefore answered,
“I don’t know if he is a sinner. One thing I do know: that though I
was blind, now I see.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,26);</script>They said to him
again, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,27);</script>He answered them, “I
told you already, and you didn’t listen. Why do you want to hear it
again? You don’t also want to become his disciples, do you?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,28);</script>They insulted him and
said, “You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,29);</script>We know that God has spoken to
Moses. But as for this man, we don’t know where he comes from.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,30);</script>The man answered them,
“How amazing! You don’t know where he comes from, yet he opened my
eyes. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,31);</script>We know that God
doesn’t listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshipper of God, and
does his will, he listens to him.<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a

type="text/javascript">cb(9,32);</script>Since the world began it has
never been heard of that anyone opened the eyes of someone born blind.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,33);</script>If this man were not from
God, he could do nothing.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,34);</script>They answered him,
“You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us?” They threw
him out.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,35);</script>Jesus heard that they
had thrown him out, and finding him, he said, <span class="j">“Do you
believe in the Son of God?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,36);</script>He answered, “Who is
he, Lord, that I may believe in him?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,37);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“You have both seen him, and it is he who speaks with
you.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,38);</script>He said, “Lord, I
believe!” and he worshiped him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,39);</script>Jesus said, <span
class="j">“I came into this world for judgment, that those who don’t
see may see; and that those who see may become blind.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,40);</script>Those of the Pharisees
who were with him heard these things, and said to him, “Are we also
blind?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,41);</script>Jesus said to them,
<span class="j">“If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you
say, ‘We see.’ Therefore your sin remains.</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,1);</script><span
class="j">“Most certainly, I tell you, one who doesn’t enter by the
door into the sheep fold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a
thief and a robber. <script type="text/javascript">cj(10,2);</script>But
one who enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. <script

because I lay down my life,<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a

type="text/javascript">cj(10,18);</script>No one takes it away from me,
but I lay it down by myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power
to take it again. I received this commandment from my Father.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,19);</script>Therefore a division
arose again among the Jews because of these words. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,20);</script>Many of them said, “He has a
demon, and is insane! Why do you listen to him?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,21);</script>Others said, “These are not
the sayings of one possessed by a demon. It isn’t possible for a demon
to open the eyes of the blind, is it?”<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N32">*</a></sup></font>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,22);</script>It was the <a
href="#N33">Feast of the Dedication</a> at Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,23);</script>It was winter, and Jesus was
walking in the temple, in Solomon’s porch. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,24);</script>The Jews therefore came around
him and said to him, “How long will you hold us in suspense? If you are
the Christ, tell us plainly.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,25);</script>Jesus answered them,
<span class="j">“I told you, and you don’t believe. The works that I
do in my Father’s name, these testify about me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,26);</script>But you don’t believe, because
you are not of my sheep, as I told you. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,27);</script>My sheep hear my voice, and I
know them, and they follow me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,28);</script>I give eternal life to them.
They will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(10,29);</script>My Father, who has given
them to me, is greater than all. No one is able to snatch them out of my
Father’s hand. <script type="text/javascript">cj(10,30);</script>I and
the Father are one.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,31);</script>Therefore Jews took
up stones again to stone him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,32);</script>Jesus answered them, <span
class="j">“I have shown you many good works from my Father. For which of
those works do you stone me?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,33);</script>The Jews answered
him, “We don’t stone you for a good work, but for blasphemy: because
you, being a man, make yourself God.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,34);</script>Jesus answered them,
<span class="j">“Isn’t it written in your law, ‘I said, you are
gods?’<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N34">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,35);</script>If he called them gods, to whom
the word of God came (and the Scripture can’t be broken), <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,36);</script>do you say of him whom the
Father sanctified and sent into the world, ‘You blaspheme,’ because I
said, ‘I am the Son of God?’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,37);</script>If I don’t do the works of my
Father, don’t believe me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,38);</script>But if I do them, though you
don’t believe me, believe the works; that you may know and believe that
the Father is in me, and I in the Father.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,39);</script>They sought again to
seize him, and he went out of their hand. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,40);</script>He went away again beyond the
Jordan into the place where John was baptizing at first, and there he
stayed. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,41);</script>Many came to
him. They said, “John indeed did no sign, but everything that John said
about this man is true.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,42);</script>Many believed in him there.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,1);</script>Now a certain man was
sick, Lazarus from Bethany, of the village of Mary and her sister, Martha.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,2);</script>It was that Mary who had
anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose
brother, Lazarus, was sick. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,3);</script>The sisters therefore sent to
him, saying, “Lord, behold, he for whom you have great affection is
sick.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,4);</script>But when Jesus
heard it, he said, <span class="j">“This sickness is not to death, but
for the glory of God, that God’s Son may be glorified by it.”</span>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,5);</script>Now Jesus loved Martha,
and her sister, and Lazarus. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,6);</script>When therefore he heard that he
was sick, he stayed two days in the place where he was. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,7);</script>Then after this he said to the
disciples, <span class="j">“Let’s go into Judea again.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,8);</script>The disciples told
him, “Rabbi, the Jews were just trying to stone you, and are you going
there again?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,9);</script>Jesus answered, <span
class="j">“Aren’t there twelve hours of daylight? If a man walks in
the day, he doesn’t stumble, because he sees the light of this world.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(11,10);</script>But if a man walks in
the night, he stumbles, because the light isn’t in him.”</span>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,11);</script>He said these things,
and after that, he said to them, <span class="j">“Our friend, Lazarus,
has fallen asleep, but I am going so that I may awake him out of
sleep.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,12);</script>The disciples
therefore said, “Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,13);</script>Now Jesus had spoken
of his death, but they thought that he spoke of taking rest in sleep.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,14);</script>So Jesus said to them
plainly then, <span class="j">“Lazarus is dead. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,15);</script>I am glad for your sakes that I
was not there, so that you may believe. Nevertheless, let’s go to
him.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,16);</script>Thomas therefore, who
is called <a href="#N35">Didymus,</a> said to his fellow disciples,
“Let’s go also, that we may die with him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,17);</script>So when Jesus came,
he found that he had been in the tomb four days already. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,18);</script>Now Bethany was near Jerusalem,
about <a href="#N36">fifteen stadia</a> away. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,19);</script>Many of the Jews had joined the
women around Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,20);</script>Then when Martha heard
that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, but Mary stayed in the house.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,21);</script>Therefore Martha said to
Jesus, “Lord, if you would have been here, my brother wouldn’t have
died. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,22);</script>Even now I know
that, whatever you ask of God, God will give you.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,23);</script>Jesus said to her, <span
class="j">“Your brother will rise again.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,24);</script>Martha said to him,
“I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,25);</script>Jesus said to her,
<span class="j">“I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in
me will still live, even if he dies. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,26);</script>Whoever lives and believes in me
will never die. Do you believe this?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,27);</script>She said to him,
“Yes, Lord. I have come to believe that you are the Christ, God’s Son,
he who comes into the world.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,28);</script>When she had said
this, she went away, and called Mary, her sister, secretly, saying, “The
Teacher is here, and is calling you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,29);</script>When she heard this,
she arose quickly, and went to him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,30);</script>Now Jesus had not yet come into
the village, but was in the place where Martha met him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,31);</script>Then the Jews who were with her
in the house, and were consoling her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up
quickly and went out, followed her, saying, “She is going to the tomb to
weep there.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,32);</script>Therefore
when Mary came to where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet,
saying to him, “Lord, if you would have been here, my brother wouldn’t
have died.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,33);</script>When Jesus therefore
saw her weeping, and the Jews weeping who came with her, he groaned in the
spirit, and was troubled, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,34);</script>and said, <span
class="j">“Where have you laid him?”</span>
<p>They told him, “Lord, come and see.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,35);</script>Jesus wept.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,36);</script>The Jews therefore
said, “See how much affection he had for him!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,37);</script>Some of them said, “Couldn’t
this man, who opened the eyes of him who was blind, have also kept this
man from dying?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,38);</script>Jesus therefore,
again groaning in himself, came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a
stone lay against it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,39);</script>Jesus said, <span
class="j">“Take away the stone.”</span>
<p>Martha, the sister of him who was dead, said to him, “Lord, by this
time there is a stench, for he has been dead four days.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,40);</script>Jesus said to her,
<span class="j">“Didn’t I tell you that if you believed, you would see
God’s glory?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,41);</script>So they took away the
stone <a href="#N37">from the place where the dead man was lying.</a>
Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, <span class="j">“Father, I thank you
that you listened to me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,42);</script>I know that you always listen to
me, but because of the multitude that stands around I said this, that they
may believe that you sent me.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,43);</script>When he had said this, he cried
with a loud voice, <span class="j">“Lazarus, come out!”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,44);</script>He who was dead came
out, bound hand and foot with wrappings, and his face was wrapped around
with a cloth.
<p>Jesus said to them, <span class="j">“Free him, and let him
go.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,45);</script>Therefore many of the
Jews, who came to Mary and saw what Jesus did, believed in him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,46);</script>But some of them went away to
the Pharisees, and told them the things which Jesus had done. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,47);</script>The chief priests therefore and
the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, “What are we doing? For this
man does many signs. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,48);</script>If
we leave him alone like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans
will come and take away both our place and our nation.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,49);</script>But a certain one of
them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, “You know
nothing at all, <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,50);</script>nor do
you consider that it is advantageous for us that one man should die for
the people, and that the whole nation not perish.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,51);</script>Now he didn’t say this of
himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus would
die for the nation, <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,52);</script>and
not for the nation only, but that he might also gather together into one
the children of God who are scattered abroad. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,53);</script>So from that day forward they
took counsel that they might put him to death. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,54);</script>Jesus therefore walked no more
openly among the Jews, but departed from there into the country near the
wilderness, to a city called Ephraim. He stayed there with his disciples.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,55);</script>Now the Passover of
the Jews was at hand. Many went up from the country to Jerusalem before
the Passover, to purify themselves. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,56);</script>Then they sought for Jesus and
spoke one with another, as they stood in the temple, “What do you
think—that he isn’t coming to the feast at all?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,57);</script>Now the chief priests and the
Pharisees had commanded that if anyone knew where he was, he should report
it, that they might seize him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,1);</script>Then six days before
the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, who had been dead,
whom he raised from the dead. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,2);</script>So they made him a supper there.
Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with him.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(12,3);</script>Mary, therefore, took a
<a href="#N38">pound</a> of ointment of pure nard, very precious, and
anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair. The house
was filled with the fragrance of the ointment. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,4);</script>Then Judas Iscariot, Simon’s
son, one of his disciples, who would betray him, said, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,5);</script>“Why wasn’t this ointment
sold for <a href="#N39">three hundred denarii,</a> and given to the
poor?” <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,6);</script>Now he said
this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and
having the money box, used to steal what was put into it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,7);</script>But Jesus said, <span
class="j">“Leave her alone. She has kept this for the day of my burial.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(12,8);</script>For you always have the
poor with you, but you don’t always have me.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,9);</script>A large crowd
therefore of the Jews learned that he was there, and they came, not for
Jesus’ sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had
raised from the dead. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,10);</script>But the chief priests conspired
to put Lazarus to death also, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,11);</script>because on account of him many
of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,12);</script>On the next day a
great multitude had come to the feast. When they heard that Jesus was
coming to Jerusalem, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,13);</script>they took the branches of the
palm trees, and went out to meet him, and cried out, “<a
href="#N40">Hosanna</a>! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the
Lord,<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N41">*</a></sup></font>
the King of Israel!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,14);</script>Jesus, having found a
young donkey, sat on it. As it is written, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,15);</script>“Don’t be afraid, daughter
of Zion. Behold, your King comes, sitting on a donkey’s colt.”<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N42">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,16);</script>His disciples didn’t
understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they
remembered that these things were written about him, and that they had
done these things to him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,17);</script>The multitude therefore that was
with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the
dead, was testifying about it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,18);</script>For this cause also the
multitude went and met him, because they heard that he had done this sign.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(12,19);</script>The Pharisees therefore
said among themselves, “See how you accomplish nothing. Behold, the
world has gone after him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,20);</script>Now there were
certain Greeks among those that went up to worship at the feast. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,21);</script>These, therefore, came to
Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, “Sir,
we want to see Jesus.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,22);</script>Philip came and told Andrew, and
in turn, Andrew came with Philip, and they told Jesus. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,23);</script>Jesus answered them, <span
class="j">“The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,24);</script>Most certainly I tell you,
unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains by
itself alone. But if it dies, it bears much fruit. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,25);</script>He who loves his life will lose
it. He who hates his life in this world will keep it to eternal life.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(12,26);</script>If anyone serves me, let
him follow me. Where I am, there will my servant also be. If anyone serves
me, the Father will honor him.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,27);</script>“Now my soul is troubled. What
shall I say? ‘Father, save me from this time?’ But for this cause I
came to this time. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,28);</script>Father, glorify your
name!”</span>
<p>Then there came a voice out of the sky, saying, “I have both
glorified it, and will glorify it again.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,29);</script>The multitude
therefore, who stood by and heard it, said that it had thundered. Others
said, “An angel has spoken to him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,30);</script>Jesus answered, <span
class="j">“This voice hasn’t come for my sake, but for your sakes.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(12,31);</script>Now is the judgment of
this world. Now the prince of this world will be cast out. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,32);</script>And I, if I am lifted up from
the earth, will draw all people to myself.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,33);</script>But he said this, signifying by
what kind of death he should die. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,34);</script>The multitude answered him,
“We have heard out of the law that the Christ remains forever.<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N43">*</a></sup></font> How do you
say, <span class="j">‘The Son of Man must be lifted up?’</span> Who is
this Son of Man?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,35);</script>Jesus therefore said
to them, <span class="j">“Yet a little while the light is with you. Walk
while you have the light, that darkness doesn’t overtake you. He who
walks in the darkness doesn’t know where he is going. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,36);</script>While you have the light,
believe in the light, that you may become children of light.”</span>
Jesus said these things, and he departed and hid himself from them.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(12,37);</script>But though he had done
so many signs before them, yet they didn’t believe in him, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,38);</script>that the word of Isaiah the
prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke,
<dl>
<dt>“Lord, who has believed our report?
<dd>To whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N44">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,39);</script>For this cause they
couldn’t believe, for Isaiah said again,
<dl>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,40);</script>“He has blinded
their eyes and he hardened their heart,
<dd>lest they should see with their eyes,
<dd>and perceive with their heart,
<dd>and would turn,
<dd>and I would heal them.”<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N45">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,41);</script>Isaiah said these
things when he saw his glory, and spoke of him.<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N46">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,42);</script>Nevertheless even of the rulers
many believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they didn’t confess
it, so that they wouldn’t be put out of the synagogue, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,43);</script>for they loved men’s praise
more than God’s praise.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,44);</script>Jesus cried out and
said, <span class="j">“Whoever believes in me, believes not in me, but
in him who sent me. <script type="text/javascript">cj(12,45);</script>He
who sees me sees him who sent me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,46);</script>I have come as a light into the
world, that whoever believes in me may not remain in the darkness. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,47);</script>If anyone listens to my sayings,
and doesn’t believe, I don’t judge him. For I came not to judge the
world, but to save the world. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,48);</script>He who rejects me, and doesn’t
receive my sayings, has one who judges him. The word that I spoke, the
same will judge him in the last day. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,49);</script>For I spoke not from myself, but
the Father who sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and
what I should speak. <script type="text/javascript">cj(12,50);</script>I
know that his commandment is eternal life. The things therefore which I
speak, even as the Father has said to me, so I speak.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,1);</script>Now before the feast
of the Passover, Jesus, knowing that his time had come that he would
depart from this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the
world, he loved them to the end. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,2);</script>During supper, the devil having
already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, to betray
him, <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,3);</script>Jesus, knowing that
the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he came forth
from God, and was going to God, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,4);</script>arose from supper, and laid aside
his outer garments. He took a towel, and wrapped a towel around his waist.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,5);</script>Then he poured water into
the basin, and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe them with
the towel that was wrapped around him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,6);</script>Then he came to Simon Peter. He
said to him, “Lord, do you wash my feet?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,7);</script>Jesus answered him,
<span class="j">“You don’t know what I am doing now, but you will
understand later.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,8);</script>Peter said to him,
“You will never wash my feet!”
<p>Jesus answered him, <span class="j">“If I don’t wash you, you have
no part with me.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,9);</script>Simon Peter said to
him, “Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,10);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“Someone who has bathed only needs to have his feet
washed, but is completely clean. You are clean, but not all of
you.”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,11);</script>For he
knew him who would betray him, therefore he said, <span class="j">“You
are not all clean.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,12);</script>So when he had washed their
feet, put his outer garment back on, and sat down again, he said to them,
<span class="j">“Do you know what I have done to you? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,13);</script>You call me, ‘Teacher’ and
‘Lord.’ You say so correctly, for so I am. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,14);</script>If I then, the Lord and the
Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s
feet. <script type="text/javascript">cj(13,15);</script>For I have given
you an example, that you also should do as I have done to you. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,16);</script>Most certainly I tell you, a
servant is not greater than his lord, neither one who is sent greater than
he who sent him. <script type="text/javascript">cj(13,17);</script>If you
know these things, blessed are you if you do them. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,18);</script>I don’t speak concerning all
of you. I know whom I have chosen. But that the Scripture may be
fulfilled, ‘He who eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against
me.’<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N47">*</a></sup></font>
<script type="text/javascript">cj(13,19);</script>From now on, I tell you
before it happens, that when it happens, you may believe that I am he.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(13,20);</script>Most certainly I tell
you, he who receives whomever I send, receives me; and he who receives me,
receives him who sent me.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,21);</script>When Jesus had said
this, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, <span class="j">“Most
certainly I tell you that one of you will betray me.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,22);</script>The disciples looked
at one another, perplexed about whom he spoke. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,23);</script>One of his disciples, whom Jesus
loved, was at the table, leaning against Jesus’ breast. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,24);</script>Simon Peter therefore beckoned
to him, and said to him, “Tell us who it is of whom he speaks.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,25);</script>He, leaning back, as
he was, on Jesus’ breast, asked him, “Lord, who is it?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,26);</script>Jesus therefore
answered, <span class="j">“It is he to whom I will give this piece of
bread when I have dipped it.”</span> So when he had dipped the piece of
bread, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,27);</script>After the piece of bread, then
Satan entered into him.
<p>Then Jesus said to him, <span class="j">“What you do, do
quickly.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,28);</script>Now no man at the
table knew why he said this to him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,29);</script>For some thought, because Judas
had the money box, that Jesus said to him, “Buy what things we need for
the feast,” or that he should give something to the poor. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,30);</script>Therefore having received that
morsel, he went out immediately. It was night.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,31);</script>When he had gone out,
Jesus said, <span class="j">“Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and
God has been glorified in him. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,32);</script>If God has been glorified in
him, God will also glorify him in himself, and he will glorify him
immediately. <script type="text/javascript">cj(13,33);</script>Little
children, I will be with you a little while longer. You will seek me, and
as I said to the Jews, ‘Where I am going, you can’t come,’ so now I
tell you. <script type="text/javascript">cj(13,34);</script>A new
commandment I give to you, that you love one another, just like I have
loved you; that you also love one another. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,35);</script>By this everyone will know that
you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,36);</script>Simon Peter said to
him, “Lord, where are you going?”
<p>Jesus answered, <span class="j">“Where I am going, you can’t follow
now, but you will follow afterwards.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,37);</script>Peter said to him,
“Lord, why can’t I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,38);</script>Jesus answered him,
<span class="j">“Will you lay down your life for me? Most certainly I
tell you, the rooster won’t crow until you have denied me three
times.</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,1);</script><span

also in me. <script type="text/javascript">cj(14,2);</script>In my

you. I am going to prepare a place for you. <script

you, I will come again, and will receive you to myself; that where I am,
you may be there also. <script

know the way.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,5);</script>Thomas said to him,
“Lord, we don’t know where you are going. How can we know the way?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,6);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to
the Father, except through me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,7);</script>If you had known me, you would
have known my Father also. From now on, you know him, and have seen
him.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,8);</script>Philip said to him,
“Lord, show us the Father, and that will be enough for us.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,9);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“Have I been with you such a long time, and do you not
know me, Philip? He who has seen me has seen the Father. How do you say,
‘Show us the Father?’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,10);</script>Don’t you believe that I am in
the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I tell you, I speak not
from myself; but the Father who lives in me does his works. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,11);</script>Believe me that I am in the
Father, and the Father in me; or else believe me for the very works’
sake. <script type="text/javascript">cj(14,12);</script>Most certainly I
tell you, he who believes in me, the works that I do, he will do also; and
he will do greater works than these, because I am going to my Father.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(14,13);</script>Whatever you will ask in
my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(14,14);</script>If you will ask anything
in my name, I will do it. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,15);</script>If you love me, keep my
commandments. <script type="text/javascript">cj(14,16);</script>I will
pray to the Father, and he will give you another <a

will come to you. <script type="text/javascript">cj(14,19);</script>Yet a

loved by my Father, and I will love him, and will reveal myself to
him.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,22);</script>Judas (not Iscariot)
said to him, “Lord, what has happened that you are about to reveal
yourself to us, and not to the world?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,23);</script>Jesus answered him,
<span class="j">“If a man loves me, he will keep my word. My Father will
love him, and we will come to him, and make our home with him. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,24);</script>He who doesn’t love me
doesn’t keep my words. The word which you hear isn’t mine, but the
Father’s who sent me. <script

while still living with you. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,26);</script>But the Counselor, the Holy

things, and will remind you of all that I said to you. <script

I give to you; not as the world gives, give I to you. Don’t let your
heart be troubled, neither let it be fearful. <script

go away, and I come to you.’ If you loved me, you would have rejoiced,
because I said ‘I am going to my Father;’ for the Father is greater
than I. <script type="text/javascript">cj(14,29);</script>Now I have told
you before it happens so that, when it happens, you may believe. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,30);</script>I will no more speak much with
you, for the prince of the world comes, and he has nothing in me. <script

me. <script type="text/javascript">cj(17,26);</script>I made known to them
your name, and will make it known; that the love with which you loved me
may be in them, and I in them.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,1);</script>When Jesus had spoken
these words, he went out with his disciples over the brook Kidron, where
there was a garden, into which he and his disciples entered. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,2);</script>Now Judas, who betrayed him, also
knew the place, for Jesus often met there with his disciples. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,3);</script>Judas then, having taken a
detachment of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and the
Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,4);</script>Jesus therefore, knowing all the
things that were happening to him, went forth, and said to them, <span
class="j">“Who are you looking for?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,5);</script>They answered him,
“Jesus of Nazareth.”
<p>Jesus said to them, <span class="j">“I am he.”</span>
<p>Judas also, who betrayed him, was standing with them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,6);</script>When therefore he said to them,
<span class="j">“I am he,”</span> they went backward, and fell to the
ground.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,7);</script>Again therefore he
asked them, <span class="j">“Who are you looking for?”</span>
<p>They said, “Jesus of Nazareth.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,8);</script>Jesus answered, <span
class="j">“I told you that I am he. If therefore you seek me, let these
go their way,”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,9);</script>that the word might be fulfilled
which he spoke, <span class="j">“Of those whom you have given me, I have
lost none.”</span><font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N55">*</a></sup></font>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,10);</script>Simon Peter
therefore, having a sword, drew it, and struck the high priest’s
servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,11);</script>Jesus therefore said to
Peter, <span class="j">“Put the sword into its sheath. The cup which the
Father has given me, shall I not surely drink it?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,12);</script>So the detachment,
the commanding officer, and the officers of the Jews, seized Jesus and
bound him, <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,13);</script>and led him
to Annas first, for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was high priest
that year. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,14);</script>Now it was
Caiaphas who advised the Jews that it was expedient that one man should
perish for the people. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,15);</script>Simon Peter followed Jesus, as
did another disciple. Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and
entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,16);</script>but Peter was standing at the
door outside. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest,
went out and spoke to her who kept the door, and brought in Peter. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,17);</script>Then the maid who kept the door
said to Peter, “Are you also one of this man’s disciples?”
<p>He said, “I am not.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,18);</script>Now the servants and
the officers were standing there, having made a fire of coals, for it was
cold. They were warming themselves. Peter was with them, standing and
warming himself. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,19);</script>The
high priest therefore asked Jesus about his disciples, and about his
teaching. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,20);</script>Jesus answered
him, <span class="j">“I spoke openly to the world. I always taught in
synagogues, and in the temple, where the Jews always meet. I said nothing
in secret. <script type="text/javascript">cj(18,21);</script>Why do you
ask me? Ask those who have heard me what I said to them. Behold, these
know the things which I said.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,22);</script>When he had said
this, one of the officers standing by slapped Jesus with his hand, saying,
“Do you answer the high priest like that?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,23);</script>Jesus answered him,
<span class="j">“If I have spoken evil, testify of the evil; but if
well, why do you beat me?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,24);</script>Annas sent him bound
to Caiaphas, the high priest. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,25);</script>Now Simon Peter was standing and
warming himself. They said therefore to him, “You aren’t also one of
his disciples, are you?”
<p>He denied it, and said, “I am not.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,26);</script>One of the servants
of the high priest, being a relative of him whose ear Peter had cut off,
said, “Didn’t I see you in the garden with him?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,27);</script>Peter therefore
denied it again, and immediately the rooster crowed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,28);</script>They led Jesus
therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium. It was early, and they
themselves didn’t enter into the Praetorium, that they might not be
defiled, but might eat the Passover. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,29);</script>Pilate therefore went out to
them, and said, “What accusation do you bring against this man?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,30);</script>They answered him,
“If this man weren’t an evildoer, we wouldn’t have delivered him up
to you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,31);</script>Pilate therefore said
to them, “Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law.”
<p>Therefore the Jews said to him, “It is not lawful for us to put
anyone to death,” <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,32);</script>that
the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying by what
kind of death he should die.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,33);</script>Pilate therefore
entered again into the Praetorium, called Jesus, and said to him, “Are
you the King of the Jews?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,34);</script>Jesus answered him,
<span class="j">“Do you say this by yourself, or did others tell you
about me?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,35);</script>Pilate answered,
“I’m not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests delivered
you to me. What have you done?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,36);</script>Jesus answered, <span
class="j">“My Kingdom is not of this world. If my Kingdom were of this
world, then my servants would fight, that I wouldn’t be delivered to the
Jews. But now my Kingdom is not from here.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,37);</script>Pilate therefore said
to him, “Are you a king then?”
<p>Jesus answered, <span class="j">“You say that I am a king. For this
reason I have been born, and for this reason I have come into the world,
that I should testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens
to my voice.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,38);</script>Pilate said to him,
“What is truth?”
<p>When he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and said to them,
“I find no basis for a charge against him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,39);</script>But you have a custom, that I
should release someone to you at the Passover. Therefore do you want me to
release to you the King of the Jews?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,40);</script>Then they all shouted
again, saying, “Not this man, but Barabbas!” Now Barabbas was a robber.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,1);</script>So Pilate then took
Jesus, and flogged him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,2);</script>The soldiers twisted thorns into
a crown, and put it on his head, and dressed him in a purple garment.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(19,3);</script>They kept saying,
“Hail, King of the Jews!” and they kept slapping him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,4);</script>Then Pilate went out
again, and said to them, “Behold, I bring him out to you, that you may
know that I find no basis for a charge against him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,5);</script>Jesus therefore came
out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. Pilate said to
them, “Behold, the man!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,6);</script>When therefore the
chief priests and the officers saw him, they shouted, saying, “Crucify!
Crucify!”
<p>Pilate said to them, “Take him yourselves, and crucify him, for I
find no basis for a charge against him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,7);</script>The Jews answered him,
“We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself
the Son of God.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,8);</script>When therefore Pilate
heard this saying, he was more afraid. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,9);</script>He entered into the Praetorium
again, and said to Jesus, “Where are you from?” But Jesus gave him no
answer. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,10);</script>Pilate therefore
said to him, “Aren’t you speaking to me? Don’t you know that I have
power to release you, and have power to crucify you?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,11);</script>Jesus answered, <span
class="j">“You would have no power at all against me, unless it were
given to you from above. Therefore he who delivered me to you has greater
sin.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,12);</script>At this, Pilate was
seeking to release him, but the Jews cried out, saying, “If you release
this man, you aren’t Caesar’s friend! Everyone who makes himself a
king speaks against Caesar!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,13);</script>When Pilate therefore
heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment seat
at a place called “The Pavement,” but in Hebrew, “Gabbatha.”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(19,14);</script>Now it was the
Preparation Day of the Passover, at about <a href="#N56">the sixth
hour.</a> He said to the Jews, “Behold, your King!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,15);</script>They cried out,
“Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!”
<p>Pilate said to them, “Shall I crucify your King?”
<p>The chief priests answered, “We have no king but Caesar!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,16);</script>So then he delivered
him to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus and led him away. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,17);</script>He went out, bearing his cross,
to the place called “The Place of a Skull,” which is called in Hebrew,
“Golgotha,” <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,18);</script>where
they crucified him, and with him two others, on either side one, and Jesus
in the middle. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,19);</script>Pilate
wrote a title also, and put it on the cross. There was written, “JESUS
OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,20);</script>Therefore many of the Jews read
this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and
it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,21);</script>The chief priests of the Jews
therefore said to Pilate, “Don’t write, ‘The King of the Jews,’
but, ‘he said, I am King of the Jews.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,22);</script>Pilate answered,
“What I have written, I have written.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,23);</script>Then the soldiers,
when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to
every soldier a part; and also the coat. Now the coat was without seam,
woven from the top throughout. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,24);</script>Then they said to one another,
“Let’s not tear it, but cast lots for it to decide whose it will
be,” that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which says,
<dl>
<dt>“They parted my garments among them.
<dd>For my cloak they cast lots.”<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N57">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p>Therefore the soldiers did these things. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,25);</script>But there were standing by the
cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of
Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,26);</script>Therefore when Jesus saw his
mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he said to his
mother, <span class="j">“Woman, behold your son!”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,27);</script>Then he said to the disciple,
<span class="j">“Behold, your mother!”</span> From that hour, the
disciple took her to his own home.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,28);</script>After this, Jesus, <a
href="#N58">seeing</a> that all things were now finished, that the
Scripture might be fulfilled, said, <span class="j">“I am
thirsty.”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,29);</script>Now a
vessel full of vinegar was set there; so they put a sponge full of the
vinegar on hyssop, and held it at his mouth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,30);</script>When Jesus therefore had
received the vinegar, he said, <span class="j">“It is
finished.”</span> He bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,31);</script>Therefore the Jews,
because it was the Preparation Day, so that the bodies wouldn’t remain
on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a special one), asked of
Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(19,32);</script>Therefore the soldiers
came, and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified
with him; <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,33);</script>but when they
came to Jesus, and saw that he was already dead, they didn’t break his
legs. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,34);</script>However one of the
soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water
came out. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,35);</script>He who has
seen has testified, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the
truth, that you may believe. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,36);</script>For these things happened, that
the Scripture might be fulfilled, “A bone of him will not be
broken.”<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N59">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,37);</script>Again another Scripture says,
“They will look on him whom they pierced.”<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N60">*</a></sup></font>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,38);</script>After these things,
Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of
the Jews, asked of Pilate that he might take away Jesus’ body. Pilate
gave him permission. He came therefore and took away his body. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,39);</script>Nicodemus, who at first came to
Jesus by night, also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about <a
href="#N61">a hundred Roman pounds.</a> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,40);</script>So they took Jesus’ body, and
bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to
bury. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,41);</script>Now in the place
where he was crucified there was a garden. In the garden was a new tomb in
which no man had ever yet been laid. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,42);</script>Then because of the Jews’
Preparation Day (for the tomb was near at hand) they laid Jesus there.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,1);</script>Now on the first day
of the week, Mary Magdalene went early, while it was still dark, to the
tomb, and saw the stone taken away from the tomb. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,2);</script>Therefore she ran and came to
Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them,
“They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we don’t know
where they have laid him!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,3);</script>Therefore Peter and
the other disciple went out, and they went toward the tomb. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,4);</script>They both ran together. The other
disciple outran Peter, and came to the tomb first. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,5);</script>Stooping and looking in, he saw
the linen cloths lying, yet he didn’t enter in. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,6);</script>Then Simon Peter came, following
him, and entered into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,7);</script>and the cloth that had been on
his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by
itself. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,8);</script>So then the other
disciple who came first to the tomb also entered in, and he saw and
believed. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,9);</script>For as yet they
didn’t know the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,10);</script>So the disciples went away again
to their own homes.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,11);</script>But Mary was standing
outside at the tomb weeping. So, as she wept, she stooped and looked into
the tomb, <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,12);</script>and she saw
two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where
the body of Jesus had lain. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,13);</script>They told her, “Woman, why are
you weeping?”
<p>She said to them, “Because they have taken away my Lord, and I
don’t know where they have laid him.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,14);</script>When she had said this, she
turned around and saw Jesus standing, and didn’t know that it was Jesus.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,15);</script>Jesus said to her,
<span class="j">“Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking
for?”</span>
<p>She, supposing him to be the gardener, said to him, “Sir, if you have
carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him
away.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,16);</script>Jesus said to her,
<span class="j">“Mary.”</span>
<p>She turned and said to him, “<a href="#N62">Rabboni</a>!” which is
to say, “<a href="#N63">Teacher</a>!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,17);</script>Jesus said to her,
<span class="j">“Don’t hold me, for I haven’t yet ascended to my
Father; but go to my brothers, and tell them, ‘I am ascending to my
Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,18);</script>Mary Magdalene came
and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had said
these things to her. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,19);</script>When therefore it was evening,
on that day, the first day of the week, and when the doors were locked
where the disciples were assembled, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and
stood in the midst, and said to them, <span class="j">“Peace be to
you.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,20);</script>When he had said
this, he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were
glad when they saw the Lord. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,21);</script>Jesus therefore said to them
again, <span class="j">“Peace be to you. As the Father has sent me, even
so I send you.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,22);</script>When he had said this, he
breathed on them, and said to them, <span class="j">“Receive the Holy
Spirit! <script type="text/javascript">cj(20,23);</script>If you forgive
anyone’s sins, they have been forgiven them. If you retain anyone’s
sins, they have been retained.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,24);</script>But Thomas, one of
the twelve, called Didymus, wasn’t with them when Jesus came. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,25);</script>The other disciples therefore
said to him, “We have seen the Lord!”
<p>But he said to them, “Unless I see in his hands the print of the
nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,26);</script>After eight days
again his disciples were inside, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, the
doors being locked, and stood in the midst, and said, <span
class="j">“Peace be to you.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,27);</script>Then he said to Thomas, <span
class="j">“Reach here your finger, and see my hands. Reach here your
hand, and put it into my side. Don’t be unbelieving, but
believing.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,28);</script>Thomas answered him,
“My Lord and my God!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,29);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“Because you have seen me,<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N64">*</a></sup></font> you have believed. Blessed
are those who have not seen, and have believed.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,30);</script>Therefore Jesus did
many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written
in this book; <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,31);</script>but these
are written, that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of
God, and that believing you may have life in his name.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,1);</script>After these things,
Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias. He
revealed himself this way. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,2);</script>Simon Peter, Thomas called
Didymus, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two
others of his disciples were together. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,3);</script>Simon Peter said to them,
“I’m going fishing.”
<p>They told him, “We are also coming with you.” They immediately went
out, and entered into the boat. That night, they caught nothing. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,4);</script>But when day had already come,
Jesus stood on the beach, yet the disciples didn’t know that it was
Jesus. <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,5);</script>Jesus therefore
said to them, <span class="j">“Children, have you anything to
eat?”</span>
<p>They answered him, “No.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,6);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find
some.”</span>
<p>They cast it therefore, and now they weren’t able to draw it in for
the multitude of fish. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,7);</script>That disciple therefore whom
Jesus loved said to Peter, “It’s the Lord!”
<p>So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he wrapped his coat
around him (for he was naked), and threw himself into the sea. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,8);</script>But the other disciples came in
the little boat (for they were not far from the land, but about <a
href="#N65">two hundred cubits</a> away), dragging the net full of fish.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(21,9);</script>So when they got out on
the land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(21,10);</script>Jesus said to them,
<span class="j">“Bring some of the fish which you have just
caught.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,11);</script>Simon Peter went up,
and drew the net to land, full of great fish, one hundred fifty-three; and
even though there were so many, the net wasn’t torn.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,12);</script>Jesus said to them,
<span class="j">“Come and eat breakfast.”</span>
<p>None of the disciples dared inquire of him, “Who are you?” knowing
that it was the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,13);</script>Then Jesus came and
took the bread, gave it to them, and the fish likewise. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,14);</script>This is now the third time that
Jesus was revealed to his disciples, after he had risen from the dead.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(21,15);</script>So when they had eaten
their breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, <span class="j">“Simon, son
of Jonah, do you love me more than these?”</span>
<p>He said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection for you.”
<p>He said to him, <span class="j">“Feed my lambs.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,16);</script>He said to him again a second
time, <span class="j">“Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me?”</span>
<p>He said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection for you.”
<p>He said to him, <span class="j">“Tend my sheep.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,17);</script>He said to him the third time,
<span class="j">“Simon, son of Jonah, do you have affection for
me?”</span>
<p>Peter was grieved because he asked him the third time, <span
class="j">“Do you have affection for me?”</span> He said to him,
“Lord, you know everything. You know that I have affection for you.”
<p>Jesus said to him, <span class="j">“Feed my sheep. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(21,18);</script>Most certainly I tell you, when
you were young, you dressed yourself, and walked where you wanted to. But
when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress
you, and carry you where you don’t want to go.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,19);</script>Now he said this,
signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God. When he had said
this, he said to him, <span class="j">“Follow me.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,20);</script>Then Peter, turning
around, saw a disciple following. This was the disciple whom Jesus
sincerely loved, the one who had also leaned on Jesus’ breast at the
supper and asked, “Lord, who is going to betray You?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,21);</script>Peter seeing him, said to Jesus,
“Lord, what about this man?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,22);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“If I desire that he stay until I come, what is that to
you? You follow me.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,23);</script>This saying therefore went out
among the <a href="#N66">brothers</a>, that this disciple wouldn’t die.
Yet Jesus didn’t say to him that he wouldn’t die, but, <span
class="j">“If I desire that he stay until I come, what is that to
you?”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,24);</script>This is
the disciple who testifies about these things, and wrote these things. We
know that his witness is true. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,25);</script>There are also many other things
which Jesus did, which if they would all be written, I suppose that even
the world itself wouldn’t have room for the books that would be written.
