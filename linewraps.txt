his handmaid                # Luke 1:48
me blessed                  # Luke 1:48
generations on those        # Luke 1:50

hand of all                 # Luke 1:71
out of the hand of          # Luke 1:74
him all the days            # Luke 1:75

by the remission            # Luke 1:77
and the shadow              # Luke 1:79

out your name               # Luke 6:22
behold, your reward         # Luke 6:23

to the false prophets.      # Luke 6:26
indebted to                 # Luke 11:4
will be broken to pieces    # Luke 20:18
