<div id="Preface">

<h1>Preface</h1>

<p>This is an edition of the four Gospels&mdash;Mark, Matthew, Luke, and
John&mdash;that is designed to be read in long passages by local communities.
With most Bibles on the market today, one can hardly read a few words without
being interrupted by a chapter or verse number, footnote, cross-reference,
chart, map, column break, extraneous section title, or pedantic sidebar. This
makes it nearly impossible to avoid <i>proof-texting</i>, taking individual
verses out of context to support foregone conclusions.  I want an approach to
Scripture that allows the text to shape the life of the specific, local
communities that I find myself in. This means reading whole books at a time
rather than isolated verses, and it means discussing it together in a group
setting. This edition uses an existing translation, the <i>World English
    Bible</i> (<u>WEB</u>), and cuts out the junk so that a community can
actually read the Gospels together.</p>

<p>The <i>New English Bible</i> (<u>NEB</u>; Oxford/Cambridge, 1970) has been
my main inspiration. I discovered it in a used-book shop in college, and fell
in love with it because it is so well-designed.  Sometimes a small group of us
would take an hour or two to read a Gospel, passing the <u>NEB</u> around the
table.  Or we would take 15 or 20 minutes to read one of the shorter epistles
at the end of the night, back in the dorm.  I even remember on one occassion
standing up amidst a crowd at a bonfire and reading from Philippians in this
<u>NEB</u>.  Unfortunately, the <u>NEB</u> is out of print, a market casualty.
It was issued as a full Bible or the New Testament, but there is no standalone
Gospels.</p>

<p>My second significant experience studying long passages of the Bible in a
community setting came years later, in a Bible study group called Be Cubed.  In
college we <i>read</i> whole books at a time, but in Be Cubed we
<i>discussed</i> whole books at a time. At any given session we might read as
much as a page or two at a time, but it was up to each person to read the full
book on their own prior to the meeting. We used <i>The Books of The Bible</i>
(<u>TBOTB</u>, International Bible Society [<u>IBS</u>], 2007), an edition that
takes <i>Today&rsquo;s New International Version</i> (<u>TNIV</u>) and does a
few interesting things with it. It sets it in one column, like the <u>NEB</u>.
Unlike the <u>NEB</u>, it puts screened out chapter/verse ranges in the footer
rather than in the margin, and uses unnumbered endnotes where the <u>NEB</u>
uses footnotes. The lack of footnotes was welcome, but the removal of chapter
and verse numbers to the footer proved to be a step too far, because then it
was hard to get everyone to the same spot on the page, especially with some
using different translations.  However, the most interesting thing about
<u>TBOTB</u> is how it reorders the books. The New Testament is organized as
four streams, each starting with a Gospel and then moving chronologically
through the sub-tradition it represents. For example, Mark is followed by 1 and
2 Peter and Jude. This is the <u>TBOTB</u>&rsquo;s most valuable contribution.
I chose to issue the four Gospels together because I think it adds
dimensionality to the reality they describe to hold them next to each other,
but I could imagine issuing separate volumes for each of the
<u>TBOTB</u>&rsquo;s Gospel streams.  Sadly, <u>TBOTB</u> is ugly.  It is set
in a clumsy sans-serif with less than half-inch margins, and the paper is so
thin that it bleeds for several pages.  The size of the Bible does present a
challenge in this regard, especially for a group like the <u>IBS</u> that is
focused on mass distribution and is therefore cost-conscious. Issuing multiple
volumes would address the challenge but would drive up the cost, and would also
deemphasize the thematic unity of the Bible.</p>

<p>I have not used them in a group setting, but two other editions of Scripture
also informed my work here: Richmond Lattimore&rsquo;s <i>The New Testament</i>
(North Point, 1997), and <i>The Four Gospels</i> (Penguin, 2008).  The former
is handsomely typeset. It has chapter/verse ranges in the header, and a
distinct lack of the overinterpretive section headings that even the <u>NEB</u>
possesses in some measure. These headings positively abound in the Penguin
edition.  There they are bolded, two and three to a page, with cross-references
to the same passage in the other Gospels in italics underneath. The chapter
numbers are distractingly large, the verse numbers are rendered inline, and the
bottom of the page is cluttered with perfunctory footnotes.  The only
commendable property of this edition is that it does in fact limit itself to
the four Gospels, the only one I have found that does so. Lattimore&rsquo;s
out-of-print first edition of Scripture (1962) included the Gospels and
Revelation.</p>

<p>I have taken inspiration from each of these editions, as well as from other
sources, as explained below.</p>

<div class="break">&#xE018;</div>

<div class="borrowing"><u>Book Ordering</u>&mdash;With Richmond Lattimore, I
    changed the ordering of the Gospels:

    <table style="margin-top: 1em;">
        <tr>
            <th>Old</th>
            <th>New</th>
        </tr>
        <tr class="r0">
            <td class="book">Matthew</td> 
            <td class="book">Mark</td> 
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="book">Mark</td> 
            <td class="book">Matthew</td> 
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="book">Luke</td> 
            <td class="book">Luke</td> 
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="book">John</td> 
            <td class="book">John</td> 
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>The reason to put Mark first is that the action moves faster, so it
    gives a better first impression of the Gospels overall. Matthew begins with
    a genealogy.  Read that same distance into Mark, and Jesus is already
    calling his first two disciples.  There is some historical justice to this
    switch as well, in that Mark is understood to have been written first.

</div>

<div class="borrowing"><u>Chapter &amp; Verse</u>&mdash;Our chapters were
    devised in the early 1200&rsquo;s and our verses in 1551. They barely
    relate to the meaning of the text, but they are wonderful for
    cross-referencing thousands of years of scholarship. They also make it
    easier for a group of readers to find passages. For these reasons they
    belong on our page, though for readability I followed the
    <u>NEB</u>&rsquo;s lead and put the chapter and verse numbers in the margin
    (though the inside one).</div>

<div class="borrowing"><u>Page Scrolling</u>&mdash;To aid in navigation, a
    black tab is printed on the right edge of the right page, representing the
    current Gospel. View the book edge on, and the tabs show the extent of each
    Gospel within the book as a whole.  The height and edge-on width of the tab
    is proportional to the size of that Gospel. Open the book, and the numbers
    next to the tab are the chapters present on the two currently-open pages.
    They are positioned according to the distance of the chapter through the
    current Gospel.

    <p>Page scrolling is designed so that as one leafs through the pages in
    flipbook fashion, the book tabs and chapter numbers &ldquo;scroll&rdquo;
    down the side of the page.  This helps to quickly locate book and chapter
    references.  The verse numbers on the inside margin then help locate verse
    references. The numbers in the footer on the outside are regular page
    numbers.

    <p>Page scrolling was inspired by the work of Edward Tufte. It began life
    as a sparkline at the bottom of the page, before evolving to its current
    form.</div>

<div class="borrowing"><u>Punctuation</u>&mdash;In the spirit of Cormac
    McCarthy (e.g., <i>The Road</i>, Knopf, 2006), I removed single and double
    quotation marks, and I replaced semicolons with commas. On one view this is
    a fad, but on another it is a return: not only did the ancient texts have
    no punctuation whatsoever, but the immediate ancestor of the text adapted
    here also did not use quotation marks (the <u>WEB</u> adds them to the
    <u>ASV</u>; see <u>Translation</u>).</div>

<div class="borrowing"><u>Scope</u>&mdash;As with <i>The Four Gospels</i>, the
    scope here is limited to the four Gospels. I chose this limit not only in
    the interest of time, but also because the entire Bible or even the New
    Testament could be too daunting for many readers.  I would hate to think
    that the Gospels were being read less simply for this reason.

    <p>I encourage any reader to also read anything and everything
    else&mdash;New Testament, Bible, Gnostic texts, other apocrypha, other
    scriptures, etc. I see the Gospels as a centerpoint, and not a boundary
    line.</div>

<div class="borrowing"><u>Sections</u>&mdash;I added sections to the Gospels,
    to give a sense of the flow of the story in each case, and to make it easy
    to divide up a Gospel over multiple sessions of a reading group. I call
    these <i>sections</i> and use letters to denote them because the word
    <i>chapter</i> with numerals is already taken.  Sections are indicated at the
    bottom inside of the right page.

    <p>These are different from the sections in other editions because they are
    large in scope, they are untitled, and they actually break the page. These
    are designed to feel like chapter breaks in a novel, giving one a place to
    stop if one really must get to bed, but at the same time drawing one
    onwards&mdash;&ldquo;Just one more chapter!&rdquo; There are 34 of them all
    told, and their size varies considerably, according to the semantic
    requirements of the text.</div>

<div class="borrowing"><u>Translation</u>&mdash;I used the <i>World English
        Bible</i> because it is the best translation in the public domain.  It
    is a literal translation, a light modernization of the <i>American Standard
        Version</i>, and therefore a descendent of the <i>King James
        Version</i> and a sibling of the <i>New American Standard Version</i>.
    Michael Paul Johnson is the editor, and it is available in multiple formats
    at ebible.org.
   
    <p>Which translation to use is not the most important question.  The
    interested person will have several in their library; the less-interested
    person will not appreciate the nuances. As to difficulty in reading, this
    is less of an issue in a group setting, where better readers can aid lesser
    readers. All but the truly illiterate should be expected to participate in
    shared reading. It builds confidence as well as community.  That said, I
    would welcome other translations of Scripture formatted along these
    lines.</div>

<div class="borrowing"><u>Typography</u>&mdash;This being my first exercise in
    typesetting a book, I thought it best to try to mimic the <u>NEB</u>. I
    referred often to Robert Bringhurst&rsquo;s <i>The Elements of
        Typographical Style</i> (v3.2, Hartley &amp; Marks, 2008) to
    understand the <u>NEB</u>&rsquo;s technique.</div>


<div class="break" style="margin-bottom: 1em;">&#xE018;</div>

<p>I hope that this book helps you to read the Gospels with others. I hope that
in doing so you discover, in the reality of your own community, the freshness
and excitement and catharsis of the way of life that Jesus introduced.</p>
