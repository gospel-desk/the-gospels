<div id="Preface">

<h1>Preface</h1>

<p>This is an edition of the Gospels&mdash;Mark, Matthew, Luke, and
John&mdash;optimized for reading at length in a group setting. I have been
given to understand that this is how Christian Scripture was first propagated,
and I prefer it to the currently-prevailing practice of reading it as an
unstructured collection of verses. This preference is partially the result of a
systematic personality. I enjoy seeing the forest <i>and</i> the trees.
However, it also derives from a love of the serendipitous, as I hope to make
clear.</p>

<blockquote>Before proceeding, I would like to say that my work here is that of
    a typesetter and an editor, not that of a translator.  For the work of
    translation, I have relied entirely on the <i>World English Bible</i>
    (<u>WEB</u>), a public domain text that itself relies on the <i>American
        Standard Version</i> (<u>ASV</u>). In this book you are getting a
    high-quality literal translation of the Bible, edited into sections and
    typeset to maximize group readability. Okay, on to serendipity
    ...</blockquote>

<p>It all started in college, when I discovered the <i>New English Bible</i>
(<u>NEB</u>; Oxford/Cambridge, 1970) in a used-book shop.  As if it were the
<i>Norton Anthology of Ancient Jewish and Early Christian Literature</i>, the
<u>NEB</u> is beautifully typeset with one column per page, and chapter and
verse numbers in the outside margin.  Here was a Bible that almost
<i>demanded</i> to be read at length.  And so we did.  Memory suggests that on
two or three occassions, a small group of us gathered in a round-table
classroom after hours, and passed around the <u>NEB</u>, each reading in turn.
I recall that a Gospel takes an hour or two to read straight through in this
fashion. More frequently, we would read one of the shorter epistles at the end
of the night, back in the dorm.  Those take 15 or 20 minutes.  I remember too
on one occassion standing up amidst a large crowd during an impromptu bonfire
on the front lawn of campus, and reading from Philippians in this <u
    class="small-caps">NEB</u>.  I took to referencing it by page number rather
than chapter and verse in my papers, to my professors&rsquo; chagrin.
Unfortunately, the <u>NEB</u> is out of print, a market casualty.  Furthermore,
it was issued as a full Bible or the New Testament, but there is no standalone
Gospels.</p>

<p>Back in my hometown after college, I fell in with a young adults&rsquo;
Bible study at church. Consistently and persistently did I answer the question
&ldquo;How can we make this group better?&rdquo; with the mantra, &ldquo;Serve
beer, and read longer passages.&rdquo; Neither suggestion gained much traction,
and the group fizzled.</p>

<p>I revived the concept a few years later, at a different church.  We called
it Be Cubed, for the three B&rsquo;s of Bible, bourbon, and bull. I used a
donation from one of the grandmothers of the church to purchase a case of the
just-published <i>The Books of The Bible</i> (International Bible Society,
2007). That edition takes <i>Today&rsquo;s New International Version</i>
(<u>TNIV</u>) and does a few interesting things with it. It sets it in one
column, with screened out chapter/verse ranges in the footer, and unnumbered
endnotes. Its real innovation is in its gerrymandering of the books. For
example, the New Testament is organized as four streams, each headed by a
Gospel, and proceeding chronologically within the same sub-tradition.  For
example, Mark follows with 1 and 2 Peter and Jude.  Sadly, the book is ugly. It
is set in a clumsy sans-serif with less than half-inch margins, and printed
cheaply on paper so thin that the reverse bleeds through. And like the
<u>NEB</u>, there is no standalone Gospels.</p>

<p>Some of Be Cubed&rsquo;s more biblically-literate participants were put off
by the innovations in <i>The Books of The Bible</i>, but it did encourage
reading long passages instead of isolated verses, and overall it worked well.
We called it the Be Cubed Bible, in fact. We had a traveling &ldquo;Bible study
in a box,&rdquo; a wooden crate with penalty flags and Be Cubed bookmarks and
extra Bibles. Our pattern was to keep a single book in view at a time, with an
emphasis on the Gospels.  If Luke was our current book, for example, then each
person would read as much of Luke as they had time and inclination that week.
&ldquo;Every man for himself, together,&rdquo; was our motto.  When we
gathered, we would begin with the single question: &ldquo;What jumped out at
you?&rdquo; Inevitably someone would volunteer an answer, and the conversation
would unfold.  And here is where my love of serendipity is excited. The
subsequent two or three hours would take on the character of an improvisation,
with each participant playing off the others, the text in front of us providing
our chords and scales, our points of departure and return.  Our palette is this
wide swath of humanity&rsquo;s central piece of literature.  It is animated by
the full range of our individual experience and study. We are responding to
each other and to the moment&mdash;now awkwardly, now heatedly, now
transformatively.  Challenges are issued.  Confessions are made.  Realizations
are had. Each study is a singular event, never to be published as a study guide
with prefab q&amp;a&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Be Cubed had a good run. We spun off a second group at a bachelor pad in the
city, and we made several retreats together. It was an important time in my
life and in the lives of 15 or so others. Why did Be Cubed fade away?  I was
unable to keep up the pace. The experience emphasized for me that we
underestimate the importance of geography for community. I think we deal with
something like the inverse square law here:

<h3>Community&nbsp;Potential&nbsp;as&nbsp;the 
    Inverse&nbsp;Square&nbsp;of&nbsp;Travel&nbsp;Time</h3>

<table style="margin: 0 1em 2em;">
    <tr>
        <th class="distance">Distance</th>
        <th class="time">Travel Time</th>
        <th class="potential">Community Potential</th>
    </tr>
    <tr class="r0">
        <td class="distance">Across the hall</td>
        <td class="time">1 second</td>
        <td class="potential">3600</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="r1">
        <td class="distance">Next door</td>
        <td class="time">10 seconds</td>
        <td class="potential">36</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="r2">
        <td class="distance">Down the street</td>
        <td class="time">1 minute </td>
        <td class="potential">1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="r3">
        <td class="distance">Next town over</td>
        <td class="time">10 minutes</td>
        <td class="potential">1/100</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="r4">
        <td class="distance">Across the city</td>
        <td class="time">45 minutes</td>
        <td class="potential">1/2025</td>
    </tr>
</table>
    
<p>Ties of blood or employment or affinity impel us to fight against this
friction: I drive to the next town to go to church, I drive across the city to
work, I drive further yet to visit my inlaws. What if we found God&rsquo;s
community in the people next door? I would be especially thrilled to learn that
this present work makes it easier for immediate neighbors to read the Gospels
with one another.</p>

<p>In any case, somewhere along the line I also picked up Richmond
Lattimore&rsquo;s <i>The New Testament</i> (North Point, 1997), and an edition
of <i>The Four Gospels</i> published by Penguin (2008). The former is
handsomely typeset.  It has chapter/verse ranges in the header, and a distinct
lack of the overinterpretive section headings that even the <u>NEB</u>
possesses in some measure. These headings abound in the Penguin edition.  They
are bolded, two and three to a page, with cross-references to the same passage
in the other Gospels in italics underneath. The chapter numbers are
distractingly large, the verse numbers are rendered inline, and most pages have
perfunctory footnotes. The translation is the simplistic Contemporary English
Version (<u>CEV</u>).  The only interesting property of this edition is that it
is a standalone Gospels. Lattimore includes the entire New Testament, though
notably he places Mark before Matthew.</p>

<p>I have taken inspiration from each of these editions, as well as from other
sources, as I shall now detail. In two places&mdash;<u>page scrolling</u>, and
<u>sections</u>&mdash;I believe I am offering something new.</p>

<div class="break">&#xE018;</div>

<div class="borrowing"><u>Book Ordering</u>&mdash;With Lattimore, I changed the
    ordering of the Gospels:

    <table style="margin-top: 1em;">
        <tr>
            <th>Old</th>
            <th>New</th>
        </tr>
        <tr class="r0">
            <td class="book">Matthew</td> 
            <td class="book">Mark</td> 
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="book">Mark</td> 
            <td class="book">Matthew</td> 
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="book">Luke</td> 
            <td class="book">Luke</td> 
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="book">John</td> 
            <td class="book">John</td> 
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>The reason to put Mark first is that the action moves faster, so it
    gives a better first impression of the Gospels overall. Matthew begins with
    a genealogy.  Read that same distance into Mark, and Jesus is already
    calling his first two disciples.  There is some historical justice to this
    switch as well, in that Mark is understood to have been written first.

</div>

<div class="borrowing"><u>Chapter &amp; Verse</u>&mdash;Our chapters were
    devised in the early 1200&rsquo;s and our verses in 1551. They bear scant
    semantic connection to the text, but they are wonderful for
    cross-referencing thousands of years of scholarship. More relevantly, they
    help a group of readers to locate a passage under discussion. For these
    reasons they belong on our page, though for readability I followed the
    <u>NEB</u>&rsquo;s lead and put the chapter and verse numbers in the margin
    (though the inside one).</div>

<div class="borrowing"><u>Page Scrolling</u>&mdash;I developed this device to
    aid in navigating the Gospels. A black tab is printed on the right edge of
    the right page, representing the current Gospel. View the book edge on, and
    the tabs show the extent of each Gospel within the book as a whole.  The
    height and edge-on width of the tab is proportional to the size of that
    Gospel. Open the book again, and the numbers next to the tabs are the
    chapters present on the two currently-open pages. They are positioned
    according to the distance of the chapter through the current Gospel.

    <p>Page scrolling is designed so that as one leafs through the pages in
    flipbook fashion, the book tabs and chapter numbers &ldquo;scroll&rdquo;
    down the side of the page.  This helps to quickly locate book and chapter
    references.  The verse numbers on the inside margin then help locate verse
    references. The numbers in the footer on the outside are regular page
    numbers.

    <p>Page scrolling was inspired by the work of Edward Tufte. It began life
    as a sparkline at the bottom of the page, before evolving to its current
    form.</div>

<div class="borrowing"><u>Punctuation</u>&mdash;In the spirit of Cormac
    McCarthy (e.g., <i>The Road</i>, Knopf, 2006), I removed single and double
    quotation marks, and I replaced semicolons with commas. On one view this is
    a fad, but on another it is a return: not only did the ancient texts have
    no punctuation whatsoever, but the immediate ancestor of the text adapted
    here also did not use quotation marks (the <u>WEB</u> adds them to the
    <u>ASV</u>; see <u>Translation</u>).</div>

<div class="borrowing"><u>Scope</u>&mdash;As with <i>The Four Gospels</i>, the
    scope is here limited to the four Gospels. I chose this limit not only in
    the interest of time, but also because my expectation is that for
    unfamiliar readers, the entire Bible or even the New Testament is too
    daunting.  I would hate to think that the Gospels were being read less
    simply for this reason.

    <p>I encourage any reader to also read anything and everything
    else&mdash;New Testament, Bible, Gnostic texts, other apocrypha, other
    scriptures, etc. I see the Gospels as a centerpoint, and not a boundary
    line.</div>

<div class="borrowing"><u>Sections</u>&mdash;I added sections to the Gospels,
    to give a sense of the flow of the story in each case, and to make it easy
    to divide up a Gospel over multiple sessions of a reading group. I call
    these <i>sections</i> and use letters to denote them because the word
    <i>chapter</i> with numerals is already taken.  Sections are indicated at the
    bottom inside of the right page.

    <p>These are different from the sections in other editions because they are
    large in scope, they are untitled, and they actually break the page. These
    are designed to feel like chapter breaks in a Steinbeck novel, giving one a
    place to stop if one really must get to bed, but at the same time drawing
    one onwards&mdash;&ldquo;Just one more chapter!&rdquo; There are 34 of them
    all told, and their size varies considerably, according to the semantic
    requirements of the text.</div>

<div class="borrowing"><u>Translation</u>&mdash;The text presented here is the
    <i>World English Bible</i>, which I chose as the best translation in the
    public domain. It is a literal translation, a light modernization of the
    original <i>American Standard Version</i>, and therefore a descendent of
    the <i>King James Version</i> and a sibling of the <i>New American
        Standard Version</i>.  Michael Paul Johnson is the editor, and it is
    available in multiple formats at ebible.org.
   
    <p>I regard as secondary the question of which translation to use.  The
    interested person will have several translations in their library, and
    which one to begin with is arbitrary. The less interested person will not
    appreciate the nuances. As to difficulty in reading, this is both
    overestimated, and ameliorated in a group setting, where better readers can
    aid lesser readers. I recommend that all but the truly illiterate be
    expected to participate in shared reading. It builds confidence as well as
    community.</div>

<div class="borrowing"><u>Typesetting</u>&mdash;This being my first exercise in
    typesetting a book, I thought it best to try to mimic the <u>NEB</u>. I
    referred often to Robert Bringhurst&rsquo;s <i>The Elements of
        Typographical Style</i> (Hartley &amp; Marks, 2008, v3.2) for
    explication of the <u>NEB</u>&rsquo;s technique.</div>


<div class="break" style="margin-bottom: 1em;">&#xE018;</div>

<p>I hope that this book helps you to read the Gospels with others, especially
your immediate neighbors. I hope that in doing so you serendipitously discover,
in the reality of your own community, the freshness and excitement and
catharsis of the way of life that Jesus introduced.</p>
