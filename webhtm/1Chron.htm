type="text/javascript">cb(4,28);</script>They lived at Beersheba, and
Moladah, and Hazarshual, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,29);</script>and at Bilhah, and at Ezem, and
at Tolad, <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,30);</script>and at Bethuel,
and at Hormah, and at Ziklag, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,31);</script>and at Beth Marcaboth, and Hazar
Susim, and at Beth Biri, and at Shaaraim. These were their cities to the
reign of David. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,32);</script>Their
villages were Etam, and Ain, Rimmon, and Tochen, and Ashan, five cities;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,33);</script>and all their villages
that were around the same cities, to Baal. These were their habitations,
and they have their genealogy. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,34);</script>Meshobab, and Jamlech, and Joshah
the son of Amaziah, <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,35);</script>and

of Shiphi, the son of Allon, the son of Jedaiah, the son of Shimri, the
son of Shemaiah—<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,38);</script>these
mentioned by name were princes in their families: and their fathers’
houses increased greatly. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,39);</script>They went to the entrance of
Gedor, even to the east side of the valley, to seek pasture for their
flocks. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,40);</script>They found fat
pasture and good, and the land was wide, and quiet, and peaceable; for
those who lived there before were of Ham. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,41);</script>These written by name came in the
days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and struck their tents, and the Meunim who
were found there, and destroyed them utterly to this day, and lived in
their place; because there was pasture there for their flocks. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,42);</script>Some of them, even of the sons of
Simeon, five hundred men, went to Mount Seir, having for their captains
Pelatiah, and Neariah, and Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,43);</script>They struck the remnant of the
Amalekites who escaped, and have lived there to this day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,1);</script>The sons of Reuben the
firstborn of Israel (for he was the firstborn; but, because he defiled his
father’s couch, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph the son
of Israel; and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(5,2);</script>For Judah prevailed above
his brothers, and of him came the prince; but the birthright was
Joseph’s:) <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,3);</script>the sons of
Reuben the firstborn of Israel: Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(5,4);</script>The sons of Joel: Shemaiah
his son, Gog his son, Shimei his son, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,5);</script>Micah his son, Reaiah his son,
Baal his son, <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,6);</script>Beerah his
son, whom Tilgath Pilneser king of Assyria carried away captive: he was
prince of the Reubenites. <script

when the genealogy of their generations was reckoned: the chief, Jeiel,
and Zechariah, <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,8);</script>and Bela
the son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel, who lived in Aroer,
even to Nebo and Baal Meon: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,9);</script>and eastward he lived even to the
entrance of the wilderness from the river Euphrates, because their
livestock were multiplied in the land of Gilead. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,10);</script>In the days of Saul, they made
war with the Hagrites, who fell by their hand; and they lived in their
tents throughout all the land east of Gilead. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,11);</script>The sons of Gad lived over
against them, in the land of Bashan to Salecah: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,12);</script>Joel the chief, and Shapham the
second, and Janai, and Shaphat in Bashan. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,13);</script>Their brothers of their
fathers’ houses: Michael, and Meshullam, and Sheba, and Jorai, and
Jacan, and Zia, and Eber, seven. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,14);</script>These were the sons of Abihail,
the son of Huri, the son of Jaroah, the son of Gilead, the son of Michael,
the son of Jeshishai, the son of Jahdo, the son of Buz; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,15);</script>Ahi the son of Abdiel, the son of
Guni, chief of their fathers’ houses. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,16);</script>They lived in Gilead in Bashan,
and in its towns, and in all the suburbs of Sharon, as far as their
borders. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,17);</script>All these were
reckoned by genealogies in the days of Jotham king of Judah, and in the
days of Jeroboam king of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,18);</script>The sons of Reuben, and the
Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, of valiant men, men able to bear
buckler and sword, and to shoot with bow, and skillful in war, were
forty-four thousand seven hundred and sixty, that were able to go forth to
war. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,19);</script>They made war with
the Hagrites, with Jetur, and Naphish, and Nodab. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,20);</script>They were helped against them,
and the Hagrites were delivered into their hand, and all who were with
them; for they cried to God in the battle, and he was entreated of them,
because they put their trust in him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,21);</script>They took away their livestock;
of their camels fifty thousand, and of sheep two hundred fifty thousand,
and of donkeys two thousand, and of men one hundred thousand. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,22);</script>For there fell many slain,
because the war was of God. They lived in their place until the captivity.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(5,23);</script>The children of the
half-tribe of Manasseh lived in the land: they increased from Bashan to
Baal Hermon and Senir and Mount Hermon. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,24);</script>These were the heads of their
fathers’ houses: even Epher, and Ishi, and Eliel, and Azriel, and
Jeremiah, and Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, mighty men of valor, famous men,
heads of their fathers’ houses. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,25);</script>They trespassed against the God
of their fathers, and played the prostitute after the gods of the peoples
of the land, whom God destroyed before them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,26);</script>The God of Israel stirred up the
spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgath Pilneser king of
Assyria, and he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites,
and the half-tribe of Manasseh, and brought them to Halah, and Habor, and
Hara, and to the river of Gozan, to this day.

Asher, heads of the fathers’ houses, choice and mighty men of valor,
chief of the princes. The number of them reckoned by genealogy for service
in war was twenty-six thousand men.

All these were of the sons of Benjamin.
<p> <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,1);</script>So all Israel were
reckoned by genealogies; and behold, they are written in the book of the
kings of Israel: and Judah was carried away captive to Babylon for their
disobedience. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,2);</script>Now the
first inhabitants who lived in their possessions in their cities were
Israel, the priests, the Levites, and the Nethinim. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,3);</script>In Jerusalem lived of the children
of Judah, and of the children of Benjamin, and of the children of Ephraim
and Manasseh: <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,4);</script>Uthai the

fathers’ households by their fathers’ houses. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,10);</script>Of the priests: Jedaiah, and
Jehoiarib, Jachin, <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,11);</script>and
Azariah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the

Immer; <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,13);</script>and their
brothers, heads of their fathers’ houses, one thousand seven hundred
sixty; very able men for the work of the service of God’s house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,14);</script>Of the Levites: Shemaiah the son
of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, of the sons of
Merari; <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,15);</script>and Bakbakkar,
Heresh, and Galal, and Mattaniah the son of Mica, the son of Zichri, the
son of Asaph, <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,16);</script>and Obadiah
the son of Shemaiah, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun, and Berechiah
the son of Asa, the son of Elkanah, who lived in the villages of the
Netophathites. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,17);</script>The
porters: Shallum, and Akkub, and Talmon, and Ahiman, and their brothers
(Shallum was the chief), <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,18);</script>who previously served in the
king’s gate eastward: they were the porters for the camp of the children
of Levi. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,19);</script>Shallum the son
of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brothers, of his
father’s house, the Korahites, were over the work of the service,
keepers of the thresholds of the tent: and their fathers had been over the
camp of Yahweh, keepers of the entry. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,20);</script>Phinehas the son of Eleazar was
ruler over them in time past, and Yahweh was with him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,21);</script>Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah
was porter of the door of the Tent of Meeting. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,22);</script>All these who were chosen to be
porters in the thresholds were two hundred and twelve. These were reckoned
by genealogy in their villages, whom David and Samuel the seer ordained in
their office of trust. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,23);</script>So
they and their children had the oversight of the gates of the house of
Yahweh, even the house of the tent, by wards. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,24);</script>On the four sides were the
porters, toward the east, west, north, and south. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,25);</script>Their brothers, in their
villages, were to come in every seven days from time to time to be with
them: <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,26);</script>for the four chief
porters, who were Levites, were in an office of trust, and were over the
rooms and over the treasuries in God’s house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,27);</script>They lodged around God’s house,
because that duty was on them; and to them pertained its opening morning
by morning. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,28);</script>Certain of
them were in charge of the vessels of service; for by count were these
brought in and by count were these taken out. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,29);</script>Some of them also were appointed
over the furniture, and over all the vessels of the sanctuary, and over
the fine flour, and the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the
spices. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,30);</script>Some of the sons
of the priests prepared the confection of the spices. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,31);</script>Mattithiah, one of the Levites,
who was the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, had the office of trust
over the things that were baked in pans. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,32);</script>Some of their brothers, of the
sons of the Kohathites, were over the show bread, to prepare it every
Sabbath. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,33);</script>These are the
singers, heads of fathers’ households of the Levites, who lived in the
rooms and were free from other service; for they were employed in their
work day and night. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,34);</script>These
were heads of fathers’ households of the Levites, throughout their
generations, chief men: these lived at Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,35);</script>In Gibeon there lived the father
of Gibeon, Jeiel, whose wife’s name was Maacah: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,36);</script>and his firstborn son Abdon, and
Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and Ner, and Nadab, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,37);</script>and Gedor, and Ahio, and
Zechariah, and Mikloth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,38);</script>Mikloth became the father of
Shimeam. They also lived with their brothers in Jerusalem, over against
their brothers. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,39);</script>Ner
became the father of Kish; and Kish became the father of Saul; and Saul
became the father of Jonathan, and Malchishua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,40);</script>The son of Jonathan was
Merib Baal; and Merib Baal became the father of Micah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,41);</script>The sons of Micah: Pithon, and
Melech, and Tahrea, and Ahaz. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,42);</script>Ahaz became the father of Jarah;
and Jarah became the father of Alemeth, and Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri
became the father of Moza; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,43);</script>and Moza became the father of
Binea; and Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son, Azel his son. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,44);</script>Azel had six sons, whose names
are these: Azrikam, Bocheru, and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and
Hanan: these were the sons of Azel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,1);</script>Now the Philistines
fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the
Philistines, and fell down slain on Mount Gilboa. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,2);</script>The Philistines followed hard
after Saul and after his sons; and the Philistines killed Jonathan, and
Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,3);</script>The battle went hard against
Saul, and the archers overtook him; and he was distressed by reason of the
archers. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,4);</script>Then Saul said
to his armor bearer, “Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it,
lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me.”
<p>But his armor bearer would not; for he was terrified. Therefore Saul
took his sword, and fell on it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,5);</script>When his armor bearer saw that
Saul was dead, he likewise fell on his sword, and died. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,6);</script>So Saul died, and his three sons;
and all his house died together. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,7);</script>When all the men of Israel who
were in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were
dead, they forsook their cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and
lived in them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,8);</script>It
happened on the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain,
that they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,9);</script>They stripped him, and took his
head, and his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines all around,
to carry the news to their idols, and to the people. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,10);</script>They put his armor in the house
of their gods, and fastened his head in the house of Dagon. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,11);</script>When all Jabesh Gilead heard all
that the Philistines had done to Saul, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,12);</script>all the valiant men arose, and
took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them
to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted
seven days. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,13);</script>So Saul died
for his trespass which he committed against Yahweh, because of the word of
Yahweh, which he didn’t keep; and also because he asked counsel of one
who had a familiar spirit, to inquire, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,14);</script>and didn’t inquire of Yahweh:
therefore he killed him, and turned the kingdom to David the son of Jesse.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,1);</script>Then all Israel
gathered themselves to David to Hebron, saying, “Behold, we are your
bone and your flesh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,2);</script>In
times past, even when Saul was king, it was you who led out and brought in
Israel. Yahweh your God said to you, ‘You shall be shepherd of my people
Israel, and you shall be prince over my people Israel.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,3);</script>So all the elders of
Israel came to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in
Hebron before Yahweh; and they anointed David king over Israel, according
to the word of Yahweh by Samuel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,4);</script>David and all Israel went to
Jerusalem (the same is Jebus); and the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the
land, were there. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,5);</script>The
inhabitants of Jebus said to David, “You shall not come in here.”
Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion. The same is the city of
David. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,6);</script>David said,
“Whoever strikes the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain.” Joab
the son of Zeruiah went up first, and was made chief. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,7);</script>David lived in the stronghold;
therefore they called it the city of David. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,8);</script>He built the city all around,
from Millo even around; and Joab repaired the rest of the city. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,9);</script>David grew greater and greater;
for Yahweh of Armies was with him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,10);</script>Now these are the chief of the
mighty men whom David had, who showed themselves strong with him in his
kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word
of Yahweh concerning Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,11);</script>This is the number of the mighty
men whom David had: Jashobeam, the son of a Hachmonite, the chief of the
thirty; he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them at
one time. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,12);</script>After him was
Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,13);</script>He was with David at
Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle,
where there was a plot of ground full of barley; and the people fled from
before the Philistines. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,14);</script>They stood in the midst of the
plot, and defended it, and killed the Philistines; and Yahweh saved them
by a great victory. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,15);</script>Three of the thirty chief men
went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the army of
the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,16);</script>David was then in the
stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,17);</script>David longed, and said,
“Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Bethlehem,
which is by the gate!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,18);</script>The three broke
through the army of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of
Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but
David would not drink of it, but poured it out to Yahweh, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,19);</script>and said, “My God forbid it
me, that I should do this! Shall I drink the blood of these men who have
put their lives in jeopardy?” For they risked their lives to bring it.
Therefore he would not drink it. The three mighty men did these things.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,20);</script>Abishai, the brother
of Joab, he was chief of the three; for he lifted up his spear against
three hundred and killed them, and had a name among the three. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,21);</script>Of the three, he was more
honorable than the two, and was made their captain: however he didn’t
attain to the three. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,22);</script>Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the
son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, he killed the
two sons of Ariel of Moab: he went down also and killed a lion in the
midst of a pit in time of snow. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,23);</script>He killed an Egyptian, a man of
great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian’s hand was a spear
like a weaver’s beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked
the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and killed him with his own spear.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,24);</script>Benaiah the son of
Jehoiada did these things, and had a name among the three mighty men.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,25);</script>Behold, he was more
honorable than the thirty, but he didn’t attain to the three: and David
set him over his guard. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,26);</script>Also the mighty men of the
armies: Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,27);</script>Shammoth the Harorite,
Helez the Pelonite, <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,28);</script>Ira
the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anathothite, <script

the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,36);</script>Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah
the Pelonite, <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,37);</script>Hezro the
Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,38);</script>Joel the brother of Nathan,
Mibhar the son of Hagri, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,39);</script>Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the
Berothite, the armor bearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,40);</script>Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the
Ithrite, <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,41);</script>Uriah the
Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,42);</script>Adina the son of Shiza the
Reubenite, a chief of the Reubenites, and thirty with him, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,43);</script>Hanan the son of Maacah, and
Joshaphat the Mithnite, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,44);</script>Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama
and Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite, <script

Joha his brother, the Tizite, <script

Mezobaite.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,1);</script>Now these are those
who came to David to Ziklag, while he yet kept himself close because of
Saul the son of Kish; and they were among the mighty men, his helpers in
war. <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,2);</script>They were armed with
bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in slinging stones
and in shooting arrows from the bow: they were of Saul’s brothers of
Benjamin. <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,3);</script>The chief was
Ahiezer; then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite, and Jeziel, and
Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth, and Beracah, and Jehu the Anathothite,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(12,4);</script>and Ishmaiah the
Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and over the thirty, and
Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and Jozabad the Gederathite, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,5);</script>Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and
Bealiah, and Shemariah, and Shephatiah the Haruphite, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,6);</script>Elkanah, and Isshiah, and Azarel,
and Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korahites, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,7);</script>and Joelah, and Zebadiah, the
sons of Jeroham of Gedor. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,8);</script>Of the Gadites there separated
themselves to David to the stronghold in the wilderness, mighty men of
valor, men trained for war, that could handle shield and spear; whose
faces were like the faces of lions, and they were as swift as the roes on
the mountains; <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,9);</script>Ezer the
chief, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,10);</script>Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah
the fifth, <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,11);</script>Attai the
sixth, Eliel the seventh, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,12);</script>Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the
ninth, <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,13);</script>Jeremiah the
tenth, Machbannai the eleventh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,14);</script>These of the sons of Gad were
captains of the army: he who was least was equal to one hundred, and the
greatest to one thousand. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,15);</script>These are those who went over
the Jordan in the first month, when it had overflowed all its banks; and
they put to flight all them of the valleys, both toward the east, and
toward the west. <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,16);</script>There
came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the stronghold to David.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(12,17);</script>David went out to meet
them, and answered them, “If you have come peaceably to me to help me,
my heart shall be knit to you; but if you have come to betray me to my
adversaries, since there is no wrong in my hands, may the God of our
fathers look thereon, and rebuke it.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,18);</script>Then the Spirit came on Amasai,
who was chief of the thirty, and he said, “We are yours, David, and on
your side, you son of Jesse: peace, peace be to you, and peace be to your
helpers; for your God helps you.” Then David received them, and made
them captains of the band. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,19);</script>Of Manasseh also there fell away
some to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle;
but they didn’t help them; for the lords of the Philistines sent him
away after consultation, saying, “He will fall away to his master Saul
to the jeopardy of our heads.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,20);</script>As he went to Ziklag,
there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and
Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zillethai, captains of thousands who
were of Manasseh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,21);</script>They
helped David against the band of rovers: for they were all mighty men of
valor, and were captains in the army. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,22);</script>For from day to day men came to
David to help him, until there was a great army, like the army of God.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(12,23);</script>These are the numbers of
the heads of those who were armed for war, who came to David to Hebron, to
turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,24);</script>The children of Judah who bore
shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred, armed for war.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(12,25);</script>Of the children of
Simeon, mighty men of valor for the war, seven thousand and one hundred.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(12,26);</script>Of the children of Levi
four thousand and six hundred. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,27);</script>Jehoiada was the leader of the
household of Aaron; and with him were three thousand and seven hundred,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(12,28);</script>and Zadok, a young man
mighty of valor, and of his father’s house twenty-two captains. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,29);</script>Of the children of Benjamin, the
brothers of Saul, three thousand: for hitherto the greatest part of them
had kept their allegiance to the house of Saul. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,30);</script>Of the children of Ephraim
twenty thousand eight hundred, mighty men of valor, famous men in their
fathers’ houses. <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,31);</script>Of
the half-tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, who were mentioned by name,
to come and make David king. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,32);</script>Of the children of Issachar, men
who had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do, their
heads were two hundred; and all their brothers were at their commandment.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(12,33);</script>Of Zebulun, such as were
able to go out in the army, who could set the battle in array, with all
kinds of instruments of war, fifty thousand, and who could command and
were not of double heart. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,34);</script>Of Naphtali one thousand
captains, and with them with shield and spear thirty-seven thousand.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(12,35);</script>Of the Danites who could
set the battle in array, twenty-eight thousand six hundred. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,36);</script>Of Asher, such as were able to
go out in the army, who could set the battle in array, forty thousand.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(12,37);</script>On the other side of the
Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half-tribe of
Manasseh, with all kinds of instruments of war for the battle, one hundred
twenty thousand. <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,38);</script>All
these being men of war, who could order the battle array, came with a
perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel: and all the
rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,39);</script>They were there with David three
days, eating and drinking; for their brothers had made preparation for
them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,40);</script>Moreover those who
were near to them, as far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought
bread on donkeys, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, food of meal,
cakes of figs, and clusters of raisins, and wine, and oil, and cattle, and
sheep in abundance: for there was joy in Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,1);</script>David consulted with
the captains of thousands and of hundreds, even with every leader. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,2);</script>David said to all the assembly of
Israel, “If it seems good to you, and if it is of Yahweh our God, let us
send abroad everywhere to our brothers who are left in all the land of
Israel, with whom the priests and Levites are in their cities that have
suburbs, that they may gather themselves to us; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,3);</script>and let us bring again the ark of
our God to us. For we didn’t seek it in the days of Saul.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,4);</script>All the assembly said
that they would do so; for the thing was right in the eyes of all the
people. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,5);</script>So David
assembled all Israel together, from the Shihor the brook of Egypt even to
the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,6);</script>David went up, and all
Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kiriath Jearim, which belonged to Judah, to
bring up from there the ark of God Yahweh that sits above the cherubim,
that is called by the Name. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,7);</script>They carried the ark of God on a
new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio
drove the cart. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,8);</script>David and
all Israel played before God with all their might, even with songs, and
with harps, and with stringed instruments, and with tambourines, and with
cymbals, and with trumpets. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,9);</script>When they came to the threshing
floor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen
stumbled. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,10);</script>The anger of
Yahweh was kindled against Uzza, and he struck him, because he put forth
his hand to the ark; and there he died before God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,11);</script>David was displeased, because
Yahweh had broken forth on Uzza; and he called that place Perez Uzza, to
this day. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,12);</script>David was
afraid of God that day, saying, “How shall I bring the ark of God home
to me?” <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,13);</script>So David
didn’t move the ark to him into the city of David, but carried it aside
into the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,14);</script>The ark of God remained with the
family of Obed-Edom in his house three months: and Yahweh blessed the
house of Obed-Edom, and all that he had.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,1);</script>Hiram king of Tyre
sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and masons, and carpenters, to
build him a house. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,2);</script>David
perceived that Yahweh had established him king over Israel; for his
kingdom was exalted on high, for his people Israel’s sake. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,3);</script>David took more wives at
Jerusalem; and David became the father of more sons and daughters. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,4);</script>These are the names of the
children whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and
Solomon, <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,5);</script>and Ibhar, and
Elishua, and Elpelet, <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,6);</script>and
Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,7);</script>and Elishama, and Beeliada, and
Eliphelet. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,8);</script>When the
Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the
Philistines went up to seek David: and David heard of it, and went out
against them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,9);</script>Now the
Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,10);</script>David inquired of God, saying,
“Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you deliver them into my
hand?”
<p>Yahweh said to him, “Go up; for I will deliver them into your hand.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,11);</script>So they came up to
Baal Perazim, and David struck them there; and David said, God has broken
my enemies by my hand, like the breach of waters. Therefore they called
the name of that place Baal Perazim. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,12);</script>They left their gods there; and
David gave commandment, and they were burned with fire. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,13);</script>The Philistines yet again made a
raid in the valley. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,14);</script>David inquired again of God; and
God said to him, “You shall not go up after them. Turn away from them,
and come on them over against the mulberry trees. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,15);</script>It shall be, when you hear the
sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then you shall
go out to battle; for God has gone out before you to strike the army of
the Philistines.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,16);</script>David did as God
commanded him: and they struck the army of the Philistines from Gibeon
even to Gezer. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,17);</script>The fame
of David went out into all lands; and Yahweh brought the fear of him on
all nations.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,1);</script>David made him houses
in the city of David; and he prepared a place for the ark of God, and
pitched for it a tent. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,2);</script>Then David said, “No one ought
to carry the ark of God but the Levites. For Yahweh has chosen them to
carry the ark of God, and to minister to him forever.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,3);</script>David assembled all
Israel at Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of Yahweh to its place, which he
had prepared for it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,4);</script>David gathered together the sons
of Aaron, and the Levites: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,5);</script>of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the
chief, and his brothers one hundred twenty; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,6);</script>of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the
chief, and his brothers two hundred twenty; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,7);</script>of the sons of Gershom, Joel the
chief, and his brothers one hundred thirty; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,8);</script>of the sons of Elizaphan,
Shemaiah the chief, and his brothers two hundred; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,9);</script>of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the
chief, and his brothers eighty; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,10);</script>of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab
the chief, and his brothers one hundred twelve. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,11);</script>David called for Zadok and
Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel,
Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,12);</script>and said to them, “You are the
heads of the fathers’ households of the Levites. Sanctify yourselves,
both you and your brothers, that you may bring up the ark of Yahweh, the
God of Israel, to the place that I have prepared for it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,13);</script>For because you didn’t carry
it at first, Yahweh our God made broke out against us, because we didn’t
seek him according to the ordinance.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,14);</script>So the priests and
the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of Yahweh, the God
of Israel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,15);</script>The children
of the Levites bore the ark of God on their shoulders with the poles
thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,16);</script>David spoke to the chief of the
Levites to appoint their brothers the singers, with instruments of music,
stringed instruments and harps and cymbals, sounding aloud and lifting up
the voice with joy. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,17);</script>So
the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brothers, Asaph
the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brothers, Ethan the
son of Kushaiah; <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,18);</script>and
with them their brothers of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and
Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and
Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-Edom, and
Jeiel, the doorkeepers. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,19);</script>So the singers, Heman, Asaph,
and Ethan, were given cymbals of brass to sound aloud; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,20);</script>and Zechariah, and Aziel, and
Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah,
with stringed instruments set to Alamoth; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,21);</script>and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu,
and Mikneiah, and Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps tuned to
the eight-stringed lyre, to lead. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,22);</script>Chenaniah, chief of the Levites,
was over the song: he instructed about the song, because he was skillful.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(15,23);</script>Berechiah and Elkanah
were doorkeepers for the ark. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,24);</script>Shebaniah, and Joshaphat, and
Nethanel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the
priests, blew the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obed-Edom and Jehiah
were doorkeepers for the ark. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,25);</script>So David, and the elders of
Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the
covenant of Yahweh out of the house of Obed-Edom with joy. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,26);</script>It happened, when God helped the
Levites who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, that they sacrificed
seven bulls and seven rams. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,27);</script>David was clothed with a robe of
fine linen, and all the Levites who bore the ark, and the singers, and
Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: and David had on him an
ephod of linen. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,28);</script>Thus all
Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh with shouting, and
with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, sounding
aloud with stringed instruments and harps. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,29);</script>It happened, as the ark of the
covenant of Yahweh came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of
Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David dancing and playing; and
she despised him in her heart.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,1);</script>They brought in the
ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for
it: and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(16,2);</script>When David had made an
end of offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings, he blessed the
people in the name of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,3);</script>He dealt to everyone of Israel,
both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a portion of meat,
and a cake of raisins. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,4);</script>He
appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of Yahweh, and
to celebrate and to thank and praise Yahweh, the God of Israel: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,5);</script>Asaph the chief, and second to
him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and
Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, with stringed instruments
and with harps; and Asaph with cymbals, sounding aloud; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,6);</script>and Benaiah and Jahaziel the
priests with trumpets continually, before the ark of the covenant of God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,7);</script>Then on that day David
first ordained to give thanks to Yahweh, by the hand of Asaph and his
brothers.
<dl>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,8);</script>Oh give thanks to
Yahweh.

give you the land of Canaan,

nation to nation,

</dl>
<p>All the people said, “Amen,” and praised Yahweh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,37);</script>So he left there,
before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, Asaph and his brothers, to
minister before the ark continually, as every day’s work required;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(16,38);</script>and Obed-Edom with their
brothers, sixty-eight; Obed-Edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be
doorkeepers; <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,39);</script>and Zadok
the priest, and his brothers the priests, before the tabernacle of Yahweh
in the high place that was at Gibeon, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,40);</script>to offer burnt offerings to
Yahweh on the altar of burnt offering continually morning and evening,
even according to all that is written in the law of Yahweh, which he
commanded to Israel; <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,41);</script>and
with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest who were chosen, who were
mentioned by name, to give thanks to Yahweh, because his loving kindness
endures forever; <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,42);</script>and
with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that
should sound aloud, and with instruments for the songs of God; and the
sons of Jeduthun to be at the gate. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,43);</script>All the people departed every
man to his house: and David returned to bless his house.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,1);</script>It happened, when
David lived in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet,
“Behold, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of
Yahweh is under curtains.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,2);</script>Nathan said to David,
“Do all that is in your heart; for God is with you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,3);</script>It happened the same
night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,4);</script>“Go and tell David my servant,
‘Thus says Yahweh, “You shall not build me a house to dwell in;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(17,5);</script>for I have not lived in a
house since the day that I brought up Israel, to this day, but have gone
from tent to tent, and from one tent to another. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,6);</script>In all places in which I have
walked with all Israel, did I speak a word with any of the judges of
Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people, saying, ‘Why have
you not built me a house of cedar?’”’
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,7);</script>“Now therefore, you
shall tell my servant David, ‘Thus says Yahweh of Armies, “I took you
from the sheep pen, from following the sheep, that you should be prince
over my people Israel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,8);</script>I
have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your
enemies from before you. I will make you a name, like the name of the
great ones who are in the earth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,9);</script>I will appoint a place for my
people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own
place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness
waste them any more, as at the first, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,10);</script>and from the day that I
commanded judges to be over my people Israel; and I will subdue all your
enemies. Moreover I tell you that Yahweh will build you a house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,11);</script>It shall happen, when your days
are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers, that I will set up
your seed after you, who shall be of your sons; and I will establish his
kingdom. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,12);</script>He shall build
me a house, and I will establish his throne forever. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,13);</script>I will be his father, and he
shall be my son. I will not take my loving kindness away from him, as I
took it from him that was before you; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,14);</script>but I will settle him in my
house and in my kingdom forever. His throne shall be established
forever.”’” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,15);</script>According to all these words,
and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,16);</script>Then David the king
went in, and sat before Yahweh; and he said, “Who am I, Yahweh God, and
what is my house, that you have brought me thus far? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,17);</script>This was a small thing in your
eyes, God; but you have spoken of your servant’s house for a great while
to come, and have respected me according to the estate of a man of high
degree, Yahweh God. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,18);</script>What
can David say yet more to you concerning the honor which is done to your
servant? For you know your servant. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,19);</script>Yahweh, for your servant’s
sake, and according to your own heart, you have worked all this greatness,
to make known all these great things. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,20);</script>Yahweh, there is none like you,
neither is there any God besides you, according to all that we have heard
with our ears. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,21);</script>What one
nation in the earth is like your people Israel, whom God went to redeem to
himself for a people, to make you a name by great and awesome things, in
driving out nations from before your people, whom you redeem out of Egypt?
<script type="text/javascript">cb(17,22);</script>For your people Israel
you made your own people forever; and you, Yahweh, became their God.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(17,23);</script>Now, Yahweh, let the
word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning his
house, be established forever, and do as you have spoken. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,24);</script>Let your name be established and
magnified forever, saying, ‘Yahweh of Armies is the God of Israel, even
a God to Israel. The house of David your servant is established before
you.’ <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,25);</script>For you, my God,
have revealed to your servant that you will build him a house. Therefore
your servant has found courage  to pray before you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,26);</script>Now, Yahweh, you are God, and
have promised this good thing to your servant. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,27);</script>Now it has pleased you to bless
the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you; for
you, Yahweh, have blessed, and it is blessed forever.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,1);</script>After this it
happened, that David struck the Philistines, and subdued them, and took
Gath and its towns out of the hand of the Philistines. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,2);</script>He struck Moab; and the Moabites
became servants to David, and brought tribute. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,3);</script>David struck Hadadezer king of
Zobah to Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the river
Euphrates. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,4);</script>David took
from him one thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty
thousand footmen; and David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved
of them for one hundred chariots. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,5);</script>When the Syrians of Damascus came
to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David struck of the Syrians twenty-two
thousand men. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,6);</script>Then David
put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to
David, and brought tribute. Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,7);</script>David took the shields of
gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to
Jerusalem. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,8);</script>From Tibhath
and from Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David took very much brass, with which
Solomon made the bronze sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,9);</script>When Tou king of Hamath
heard that David had struck all the army of Hadadezer king of Zobah,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,10);</script>he sent Hadoram his son
to king David, to Greet him, and to bless him, because he had fought
against Hadadezer and struck him; (for Hadadezer had wars with Tou;) and
he had with him all kinds of vessels of gold and silver and brass. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,11);</script>King David also dedicated these
to Yahweh, with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the
nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and
from the Philistines, and from Amalek. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,12);</script>Moreover Abishai the son of
Zeruiah struck of the Edomites in the Valley of Salt eighteen thousand.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,13);</script>He put garrisons in
Edom; and all the Edomites became servants to David. Yahweh gave victory
to David wherever he went. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,14);</script>David reigned over all Israel;
and he executed justice and righteousness to all his people. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,15);</script>Joab the son of Zeruiah was over
the army; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,16);</script>and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and
Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; and Shavsha was scribe;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,17);</script>and Benaiah the son of
Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of
David were chief about the king.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,1);</script>It happened after
this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son
reigned in his place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,2);</script>David said, “I will show
kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to
me.”
<p>So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father.
David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun,
to comfort him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,3);</script>But the
princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, “Do you think that David
honors your father, in that he has sent comforters to you? Haven’t his
servants come to you to search, to overthrow, and to spy out the land?”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(19,4);</script>So Hanun took David’s
servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle, even
to their buttocks, and sent them away. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,5);</script>Then there went certain persons,
and told David how the men were served. He sent to meet them; for the men
were greatly ashamed. The king said, “Stay at Jericho until your beards
have grown, and then return.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,6);</script>When the children of
Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the
children of Ammon sent one thousand talents of silver to hire them
chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Arammaacah, and out
of Zobah. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,7);</script>So they hired
for themselves thirty-two thousand chariots, and the king of Maacah and
his people, who came and encamped before Medeba. The children of Ammon
gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(19,8);</script>When David heard of it,
he sent Joab, and all the army of the mighty men. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,9);</script>The children of Ammon came out,
and put the battle in array at the gate of the city: and the kings who had
come were by themselves in the field. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,10);</script>Now when Joab saw that the
battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice
men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,11);</script>The rest of the people he
committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and they put themselves in
array against the children of Ammon. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,12);</script>He said, “If the Syrians are
too strong for me, then you are to help me; but if the children of Ammon
are too strong for you, then I will help you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,13);</script>Be courageous, and let us be
strong for our people, and for the cities of our God. May Yahweh do that
which seems good to him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,14);</script>So Joab and the
people who were with him drew near before the Syrians to the battle; and
they fled before him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,15);</script>When the children of Ammon saw
that the Syrians had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother,
and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,16);</script>When the Syrians saw that they
were defeated by Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians
who were beyond the River, with Shophach the captain of the army of
Hadadezer at their head. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,17);</script>It was told David; and he
gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came on
them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the
battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,18);</script>The Syrians fled before Israel;
and David killed of the Syrians the men of seven thousand chariots, and
forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the army.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(19,19);</script>When the servants of
Hadadezer saw that they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with
David, and served him: neither would the Syrians help the children of
Ammon any more.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,1);</script>It happened, at the
time of the return of the year, at the time when kings go out, that Joab
led forth the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and
came and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at Jerusalem. Joab struck
Rabbah, and overthrew it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,2);</script>David took the crown of their
king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there
were precious stones in it; and it was set on David’s head: and he
brought forth the spoil of the city, exceeding much. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,3);</script>He brought forth the people who
were therein, and cut them with saws, and with iron picks, and with axes.
David did so to all the cities of the children of Ammon. David and all the
people returned to Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,4);</script>It happened after this, that
there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines: then Sibbecai the
Hushathite killed Sippai, of the sons of the giant; and they were subdued.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(20,5);</script>There was again war with
the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of
Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(20,6);</script>There was again war at
Gath, where there was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were
twenty-four, six on each hand, and six on each foot; and he also was born
to the giant. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,7);</script>When he
defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David’s brother killed him.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(20,8);</script>These were born to the
giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his
servants.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,1);</script>Satan stood up against
Israel, and moved David to number Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,2);</script>David said to Joab and to the
princes of the people, “Go, number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan;
and bring me word, that I may know the sum of them.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,3);</script>Joab said, “May
Yahweh make his people a hundred times as many as they are. But, my lord
the king, aren’t they all my lord’s servants? Why does my lord require
this thing? Why will he be a cause of guilt to Israel?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,4);</script>Nevertheless the
king’s word prevailed against Joab. Therefore Joab departed, and went
throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,5);</script>Joab gave up the sum of the
numbering of the people to David. All those of Israel were one million one
hundred thousand men who drew sword: and in Judah were four hundred
seventy thousand men who drew sword. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,6);</script>But he didn’t count Levi and
Benjamin among them; for the king’s word was abominable to Joab. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,7);</script>God was displeased with this
thing; therefore he struck Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,8);</script>David said to God, “I have
sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing. But now, put away, I beg
you, the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,9);</script>Yahweh spoke to Gad,
David’s seer, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,10);</script>“Go and speak to David,
saying, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “I offer you three things. Choose one of
them, that I may do it to you.”’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,11);</script>So Gad came to David,
and said to him, “Thus says Yahweh, ‘Take your choice: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,12);</script>either three years of famine; or
three months to be consumed before your foes, while the sword of your
enemies overtakes you; or else three days the sword of Yahweh, even
pestilence in the land, and the angel of Yahweh destroying throughout all
the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall return
to him who sent me.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,13);</script>David said to Gad,
“I am in distress. Let me fall, I pray, into the hand of Yahweh; for his
mercies are very great. Let me not fall into the hand of man.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,14);</script>So Yahweh sent a
pestilence on Israel; and seventy thousand men of Israel fell. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,15);</script>God sent an angel to Jerusalem
to destroy it. As he was about to destroy, Yahweh saw, and he relented of
the disaster, and said to the destroying angel, “It is enough; now stay
your hand.” The angel of Yahweh was standing by the threshing floor of
Ornan the Jebusite. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,16);</script>David lifted up his eyes, and
saw the angel of Yahweh standing between earth and the sky, having a drawn
sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem.
<p>Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(21,17);</script>David said to God,
“Isn’t it I who commanded the people to be numbered? It is even I who
have sinned and done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done?
Please let your hand, O Yahweh my God, be against me, and against my
father’s house; but not against your people, that they should be
plagued.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,18);</script>Then the angel of
Yahweh commanded Gad to tell David that David should go up, and raise an
altar to Yahweh in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,19);</script>David went up at the saying of
Gad, which he spoke in the name of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,20);</script>Ornan turned back, and saw the
angel; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was
threshing wheat. <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,21);</script>As
David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the
threshing floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(21,22);</script>Then David said to
Ornan, “Give me the place of this threshing floor, that I may build
thereon an altar to Yahweh. You shall sell it to me for the full price,
that the plague may be stopped from afflicting the people.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,23);</script>Ornan said to David,
“Take it for yourself, and let my lord the king do that which is good in
his eyes. Behold, I give the oxen for burnt offerings, and the threshing
instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal offering. I give it
all.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,24);</script>King David said to
Ornan, “No; but I will most certainly buy it for the full price. For I
will not take that which is yours for Yahweh, nor offer a burnt offering
without cost.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,25);</script>So David gave to
Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,26);</script>David built an altar to Yahweh
there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called on
Yahweh; and he answered him from the sky by fire on the altar of burnt
offering. <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,27);</script>Yahweh
commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into its sheath.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(21,28);</script>At that time, when David
saw that Yahweh had answered him in the threshing floor of Ornan the
Jebusite, then he sacrificed there. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,29);</script>For the tabernacle of Yahweh,
which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering, were
at that time in the high place at Gibeon. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,30);</script>But David couldn’t go before
it to inquire of God; for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel
of Yahweh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,1);</script>Then David said,
“This is the house of Yahweh God, and this is the altar of burnt
offering for Israel.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,2);</script>David gave orders to gather
together the foreigners who were in the land of Israel; and he set masons
to cut worked stones to build God’s house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,3);</script>David prepared iron in abundance
for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the couplings; and brass
in abundance without weight; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,4);</script>and cedar trees without number:
for the Sidonians and they of Tyre brought cedar trees in abundance to
David. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,5);</script>David said,
“Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be built
for Yahweh must be exceedingly magnificent, of fame and of glory
throughout all countries. I will therefore make preparation for it.” So
David prepared abundantly before his death. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,6);</script>Then he called for Solomon his
son, and commanded him to build a house for Yahweh, the God of Israel.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(22,7);</script>David said to Solomon his
son, “As for me, it was in my heart to build a house to the name of
Yahweh my God. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,8);</script>But the
word of Yahweh came to me, saying, ‘You have shed blood abundantly, and
have made great wars. You shall not build a house to my name, because you
have shed much blood on the earth in my sight. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,9);</script>Behold, a son shall be born to
you, who shall be a man of rest. I will give him rest from all his enemies
all around; for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and
quietness to Israel in his days. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,10);</script>He shall build a house for my
name; and he shall be my son, and I will be his father; and I will
establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,11);</script>Now, my son, may Yahweh be with
you and prosper you, and build the house of Yahweh your God, as he has
spoken concerning you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,12);</script>May Yahweh give you discretion
and understanding, and put you in charge of Israel; that so you may keep
the law of Yahweh your God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,13);</script>Then you will prosper, if you
observe to do the statutes and the ordinances which Yahweh gave Moses
concerning Israel. Be strong, and courageous. Don’t be afraid, neither
be dismayed. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,14);</script>Now,
behold, in my affliction I have prepared for the house of Yahweh one
hundred thousand talents of gold, one million talents of silver, and brass
and iron without weight; for it is in abundance. I have also prepared
timber and stone; and you may add to them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,15);</script>There are also workmen with you
in abundance, cutters and workers of stone and timber, and all kinds of
men who are skillful in every kind of work: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,16);</script>of the gold, the silver, and the
brass, and the iron, there is no number. Arise and be doing, and may
Yahweh be with you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,17);</script>David also commanded
all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,18);</script>“Isn’t Yahweh your God with
you? Hasn’t he given you rest on every side? For he has delivered the
inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before
Yahweh, and before his people. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,19);</script>Now set your heart and your soul
to seek after Yahweh your God. Arise therefore, and build the sanctuary of
Yahweh God, to bring the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, and the holy
vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of
Yahweh.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,1);</script>Now David was old and
full of days; and he made Solomon his son king over Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,2);</script>He gathered together all the
princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,3);</script>The Levites were numbered from
thirty years old and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man,
was thirty-eight thousand. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,4);</script>David said, “Of these,
twenty-four thousand were to oversee the work of the house of Yahweh; six
thousand were officers and judges; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,5);</script>four thousand were doorkeepers;
and four thousand praised Yahweh with the instruments which I made, for
giving praise.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,6);</script>David divided them
into divisions according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(23,7);</script>Of the Gershonites: Ladan
and Shimei. <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,8);</script>The sons of
Ladan: Jehiel the chief, and Zetham, and Joel, three. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,9);</script>The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth,
and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathers’
households of Ladan. <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,10);</script>The
sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the
sons of Shimei. <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,11);</script>Jahath
was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah didn’t have
many sons; therefore they became a fathers’ house in one reckoning.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(23,12);</script>The sons of Kohath:
Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,13);</script>The sons of Amram: Aaron and
Moses; and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy
things, he and his sons, forever, to burn incense before Yahweh, to
minister to him, and to bless in his name, forever. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,14);</script>But as for Moses the man of God,
his sons were named among the tribe of Levi. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,15);</script>The sons of Moses: Gershom and
Eliezer. <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,16);</script>The sons of
Gershom: Shebuel the chief. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,17);</script>The sons of Eliezer were:
Rehabiah the chief; and Eliezer had no other sons; but the sons of
Rehabiah were very many. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,18);</script>The sons of Izhar: Shelomith the
chief. <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,19);</script>The sons of
Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and
Jekameam the fourth. <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,20);</script>The
sons of Uzziel: Micah the chief, and Isshiah the second. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,21);</script>The sons of Merari: Mahli and
Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,22);</script>Eleazar died, and had no sons,
but daughters only: and their brothers the sons of Kish took them as
wives. <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,23);</script>The sons of
Mushi: Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,24);</script>These were the sons of Levi
after their fathers’ houses, even the heads of the fathers’ houses of
those who were counted individually, in the number of names by their
polls, who did the work for the service of the house of Yahweh, from
twenty years old and upward. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,25);</script>For David said, “Yahweh, the
God of Israel, has given rest to his people; and he dwells in Jerusalem
forever. <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,26);</script>Also the
Levites will no longer need to carry the tabernacle and all its vessels
for its service.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,27);</script>For
by the last words of David the sons of Levi were numbered, from twenty
years old and upward. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,28);</script>For their office was to wait on
the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of Yahweh, in the courts,
and in the rooms, and in the purifying of all holy things, even the work
of the service of God’s house; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,29);</script>for the show bread also, and for
the fine flour for a meal offering, whether of unleavened wafers, or of
that which is baked in the pan, or of that which is soaked, and for all
kinds of measure and size; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,30);</script>and to stand every morning to
thank and praise Yahweh, and likewise in the evening; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,31);</script>and to offer all burnt offerings
to Yahweh, on the Sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts, in
number according to the ordinance concerning them, continually before
Yahweh; <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,32);</script>and that they
should keep the duty of the Tent of Meeting, and the duty of the holy
place, and the duty of the sons of Aaron their brothers, for the service
of the house of Yahweh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,1);</script>These were the
divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron: Nadab and Abihu,
Eleazar and Ithamar. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,2);</script>But
Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore
Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest’s office. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,3);</script>David with Zadok of the sons of
Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, divided them according to
their ordering in their service. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,4);</script>There were more chief men found
of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and they were divided
like this: of the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen, heads of fathers’
houses; and of the sons of Ithamar, according to their fathers’ houses,
eight. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,5);</script>Thus were they
divided impartially by drawing lots; for there were princes of the
sanctuary, and princes of God, both of the sons of Eleazar, and of the
sons of Ithamar. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,6);</script>Shemaiah
the son of Nethanel the scribe, who was of the Levites, wrote them in the
presence of the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech
the son of Abiathar, and the heads of the fathers’ households of the
priests and of the Levites; one fathers’ house being taken for Eleazar,
and one taken for Ithamar. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,7);</script>Now the first lot came forth to
Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,8);</script>the third to Harim, the fourth to
Seorim, <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,9);</script>the fifth to
Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin, <script

eighth to Abijah, <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,11);</script>the
ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,12);</script>the eleventh to Eliashib, the
twelfth to Jakim, <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,13);</script>the
thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,14);</script>the fifteenth to Bilgah, the
sixteenth to Immer, <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,15);</script>the
seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,16);</script>the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the
twentieth to Jehezkel, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,17);</script>the twenty-first to Jachin, the
twenty-second to Gamul, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,18);</script>the twenty-third to Delaiah, the
twenty-fourth to Maaziah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,19);</script>This was their ordering in their
service, to come into the house of Yahweh according to the ordinance given
to them by Aaron their father, as Yahweh, the God of Israel, had commanded
him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,20);</script>Of the rest of the
sons of Levi: of the sons of Amram, Shubael; of the sons of Shubael,
Jehdeiah. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,21);</script>Of Rehabiah:
of the sons of Rehabiah, Isshiah the chief. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,22);</script>Of the Izharites, Shelomoth; of
the sons of Shelomoth, Jahath. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,23);</script>The sons of Hebron: Jeriah,
Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,24);</script>The sons of Uzziel, Micah; of
the sons of Micah, Shamir. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,25);</script>The brother of Micah, Isshiah;
of the sons of Isshiah, Zechariah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,26);</script>The sons of Merari: Mahli and
Mushi; the sons of Jaaziah: Beno. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,27);</script>The sons of Merari: of Jaaziah,
Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur, and Ibri. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,28);</script>Of Mahli: Eleazar, who had no
sons. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,29);</script>Of Kish; the sons
of Kish: Jerahmeel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,30);</script>The
sons of Mushi: Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the
Levites after their fathers’ houses. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,31);</script>These likewise cast lots even as
their brothers the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and
Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the heads of the fathers’ households of the
priests and of the Levites; the fathers’ households of the chief even as
those of his younger brother.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,1);</script>Moreover, David and
the captains of the army set apart for the service certain of the sons of
Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with
stringed instruments, and with cymbals: and the number of those who did
the work according to their service was: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,2);</script>of the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, and
Joseph, and Nethaniah, and Asharelah, the sons of Asaph, under the hand of
Asaph, who prophesied after the order of the king. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,3);</script>Of Jeduthun; the sons of
Jeduthun: Gedaliah, and Zeri, and Jeshaiah, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah,
six, under the hands of their father Jeduthun with the harp, who
prophesied in giving thanks and praising Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,4);</script>Of Heman; the sons of Heman:
Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, and Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani,
Eliathah, Giddalti, and Romamti-Ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir,
Mahazioth. <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,5);</script>All these were
the sons of Heman the king’s seer in the words of God, to lift up the
horn. God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,6);</script>All these were under the hands of
their father for song in the house of Yahweh, with cymbals, stringed
instruments, and harps, for the service of God’s house; Asaph, Jeduthun,
and Heman being under the order of the king. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,7);</script>The number of them, with their
brothers who were instructed in singing to Yahweh, even all who were
skillful, was two hundred eighty-eight. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,8);</script>They cast lots for their offices,
all alike, as well the small as the great, the teacher as the scholar.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(25,9);</script>Now the first lot came
forth for Asaph to Joseph: the second to Gedaliah; he and his brothers and
sons were twelve: <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,10);</script>the
third to Zaccur, his sons and his brothers, twelve: <script

Romamti-Ezer, his sons and his brothers, twelve.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,1);</script>For the divisions of
the doorkeepers: of the Korahites, Meshelemiah the son of Kore, of the
sons of Asaph. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,2);</script>Meshelemiah had sons: Zechariah
the firstborn, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the
fourth, <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,3);</script>Elam the fifth,
Jehohanan the sixth, Eliehoenai the seventh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,4);</script>Obed-Edom had sons: Shemaiah the
firstborn, Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, and Sacar the fourth, and
Nethanel the fifth, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,5);</script>Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the
seventh, Peullethai the eighth; for God blessed him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,6);</script>Also to Shemaiah his son were
sons born, who ruled over the house of their father; for they were mighty
men of valor. <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,7);</script>The sons of
Shemaiah: Othni, and Rephael, and Obed, Elzabad, whose brothers were
valiant men, Elihu, and Semachiah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,8);</script>All these were of the sons of
Obed-Edom: they and their sons and their brothers, able men in strength
for the service; sixty-two of Obed-Edom. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,9);</script>Meshelemiah had sons and
brothers, valiant men, eighteen. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,10);</script>Also Hosah, of the children of
Merari, had sons: Shimri the chief, (for though he was not the firstborn,
yet his father made him chief), <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,11);</script>Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the
third, Zechariah the fourth: all the sons and brothers of Hosah were
thirteen. <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,12);</script>Of these were
the divisions of the doorkeepers, even of the chief men, having offices
like their brothers, to minister in the house of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,13);</script>They cast lots, the small as
well as the great, according to their fathers’ houses, for every gate.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(26,14);</script>The lot eastward fell to
Shelemiah. Then for Zechariah his son, a wise counselor, they cast lots;
and his lot came out northward. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,15);</script>To Obed-Edom southward; and to
his sons the storehouse. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,16);</script>To Shuppim and Hosah westward,
by the gate of Shallecheth, at the causeway that goes up, watch against
watch. <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,17);</script>Eastward were six
Levites, northward four a day, southward four a day, and for the
storehouse two and two. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,18);</script>For Parbar westward, four at the
causeway, and two at Parbar. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,19);</script>These were the divisions of the
doorkeepers; of the sons of the Korahites, and of the sons of Merari.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(26,20);</script>Of the Levites, Ahijah
was over the treasures of God’s house, and over the treasures of the
dedicated things. <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,21);</script>The
sons of Ladan, the sons of the Gershonites belonging to Ladan, the heads
of the fathers’ households belonging to Ladan the Gershonite: Jehieli.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(26,22);</script>The sons of Jehieli:
Zetham, and Joel his brother, over the treasures of the house of Yahweh.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(26,23);</script>Of the Amramites, of the
Izharites, of the Hebronites, of the Uzzielites: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,24);</script>and Shebuel the son of Gershom,
the son of Moses, was ruler over the treasures. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,25);</script>His brothers: of Eliezer,
Rehabiah his son, and Jeshaiah his son, and Joram his son, and Zichri his
son, and Shelomoth his son. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,26);</script>This Shelomoth and his brothers
were over all the treasures of the dedicated things, which David the king,
and the heads of the fathers’ households, the captains over thousands
and hundreds, and the captains of the army, had dedicated. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,27);</script>They dedicated some of the spoil
won in battles to repair the house of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,28);</script>All that Samuel the seer, and
Saul the son of Kish, and Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of
Zeruiah, had dedicated, whoever had dedicated anything, it was under the
hand of Shelomoth, and of his brothers. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,29);</script>Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and
his sons were for the outward business over Israel, for officers and
judges. <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,30);</script>Of the
Hebronites, Hashabiah and his brothers, men of valor, one thousand seven
hundred, had the oversight of Israel beyond the Jordan westward, for all
the business of Yahweh, and for the service of the king. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,31);</script>Of the Hebronites was Jerijah
the chief, even of the Hebronites, according to their generations by
fathers’ households. In the fortieth year of the reign of David they
were sought for, and there were found among them mighty men of valor at
Jazer of Gilead. <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,32);</script>His
brothers, men of valor, were two thousand seven hundred, heads of
fathers’ households, whom king David made overseers over the Reubenites,
and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of the Manassites, for every matter
pertaining to God, and for the affairs of the king.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,1);</script>Now the children of
Israel after their number, the heads of fathers’ households and the
captains of thousands and of hundreds, and their officers who served the
king, in any matter of the divisions which came in and went out month by
month throughout all the months of the year—of every division were
twenty-four thousand. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,2);</script>Over the first division for the
first month was Jashobeam the son of Zabdiel: and in his division were

army for the third month was Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada the priest,
chief: and in his division were twenty-four thousand. <script

mighty man of the thirty, and over the thirty: and of his division was
Ammizabad his son. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,7);</script>The
fourth captain for the fourth month was Asahel the brother of Joab, and
Zebadiah his son after him: and in his division were twenty-four thousand.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(27,8);</script>The fifth captain for
this fifth month was Shamhuth the Izrahite: and in his division were
twenty-four thousand. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,9);</script>The

month was Maharai the Netophathite, of the Zerahites: and in his division
were Twenty-four thousand. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,14);</script>The eleventh captain for the
eleventh month was Benaiah the Pirathonite, of the children of Ephraim:

Jeroham. These were the captains of the tribes of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,23);</script>But David didn’t take the
number of them from twenty years old and under, because Yahweh had said he
would increase Israel like the stars of the sky. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,24);</script>Joab the son of Zeruiah began to
number, but didn’t finish; and there came wrath for this on Israel;
neither was the number put into the account in the chronicles of king
David. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,25);</script>Over the king’s
treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel: and over the treasures in the
fields, in the cities, and in the villages, and in the towers, was

the flocks was Jaziz the Hagrite. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,31);</script>All these were the rulers of the
substance which was king David’s. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,32);</script>Also Jonathan, David’s uncle,
was a counselor, a man of understanding, and a scribe: and Jehiel the son
of Hachmoni was with the king’s sons: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,33);</script>Ahithophel was the king’s
counselor: and Hushai the Archite was the king’s friend: <script

possessions of the king and of his sons, with the officers, and the mighty
men, even all the mighty men of valor, to Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,2);</script>Then David the king stood up on
his feet, and said, “Hear me, my brothers, and my people! As for me, it
was in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of
Yahweh, and for the footstool of our God; and I had prepared for the
building. <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,3);</script>But God said to
me, ‘You shall not build a house for my name, because you are a man of
war, and have shed blood.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,4);</script>However Yahweh, the God of
Israel, chose me out of all the house of my father to be king over Israel
forever. For he has chosen Judah to be prince; and in the house of Judah,
the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he took pleasure
in me to make me king over all Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,5);</script>Of all my sons (for Yahweh has
given me many sons), he has chosen Solomon my son to sit on the throne of
Yahweh’s kingdom over Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,6);</script>He said to me, ‘Solomon, your
son, shall build my house and my courts; for I have chosen him to be my
son, and I will be his father. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,7);</script>I will establish his kingdom
forever, if he continues to do my commandments and my ordinances, as at
this day.’ <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,8);</script>Now
therefore, in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of Yahweh, and in the
audience of our God, observe and seek out all the commandments of Yahweh
your God; that you may possess this good land, and leave it for an
inheritance to your children after you forever. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,9);</script>You, Solomon my son, know the God
of your father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing
mind; for Yahweh searches all hearts, and understands all the imaginations
of the thoughts. If you seek him, he will be found by you; but if you
forsake him, he will cast you off forever. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,10);</script>Take heed now; for Yahweh has
chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary. Be strong, and do it.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,11);</script>Then David gave to
Solomon his son the pattern of the porch of the temple, and of its houses,
and of its treasuries, and of the upper rooms of it, and of the inner
rooms of it, and of the place of the mercy seat; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,12);</script>and the pattern of all that he
had by the Spirit, for the courts of the house of Yahweh, and for all the
surrounding rooms, for the treasuries of God’s house, and for the
treasuries of the dedicated things; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,13);</script>also for the divisions of the
priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house
of Yahweh, and for all the vessels of service in the house of Yahweh;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(28,14);</script>of gold by weight for
the gold, for all vessels of every kind of service; for all the vessels of
silver by weight, for all vessels of every kind of service; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,15);</script>by weight also for the
lampstands of gold, and for its lamps, of gold, by weight for every
lampstand and for its lamps; and for the lampstands of silver, by weight
for every lampstand and for its lamps, according to the use of every
lampstand; <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,16);</script>and the gold
by weight for the tables of show bread, for every table; and silver for
the tables of silver; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,17);</script>and the forks, and the basins,
and the cups, of pure gold; and for the golden bowls by weight for every
bowl; and for the silver bowls by weight for every bowl; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,18);</script>and for the altar of incense
refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot, the
cherubim, that spread out, and covered the ark of the covenant of Yahweh.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(28,19);</script>“All this,” said
David, “I have been made to understand in writing from the hand of
Yahweh, even all the works of this pattern.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,20);</script>David said to Solomon
his son, “Be strong and courageous, and do it. Don’t be afraid, nor be
dismayed; for Yahweh God, even my God, is with you. He will not fail you,
nor forsake you, until all the work for the service of the house of Yahweh
is finished. <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,21);</script>Behold,
there are the divisions of the priests and the Levites, for all the
service of God’s house. There shall be with you in all kinds of work
every willing man who has skill, for any kind of service. Also the
captains and all the people will be entirely at your command.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,1);</script>David the king said to
all the assembly, “Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is yet
young and tender, and the work is great; for the palace is not for man,
but for Yahweh God. <script type="text/javascript">cb(29,2);</script>Now I
have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for the
things of gold, and the silver for the things of silver, and the brass for
the things of brass, the iron for the things of iron, and wood for the
things of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set, stones for inlaid work,
and of various colors, and all kinds of precious stones, and marble stones
in abundance. <script type="text/javascript">cb(29,3);</script>In
addition, because I have set my affection on the house of my God, since I
have a treasure of my own of gold and silver, I give it to the house of my
God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,4);</script>even three thousand talents of
gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver,
with which to overlay the walls of the houses; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,5);</script>of gold for the things of gold,
and of silver for the things of silver, and for all kinds of work to be
made by the hands of artisans. Who then offers willingly to consecrate
himself this day to Yahweh?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,6);</script>Then the princes of the
fathers’ households, and the princes of the tribes of Israel, and the
captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers over the king’s
work, offered willingly; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,7);</script>and they gave for the service of
God’s house of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics, and
of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents,
and of iron a hundred thousand talents. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,8);</script>They with whom precious stones
were found gave them to the treasure of the house of Yahweh, under the
hand of Jehiel the Gershonite. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,9);</script>Then the people rejoiced, because
they offered willingly, because with a perfect heart they offered
willingly to Yahweh: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(29,10);</script>Therefore David blessed
Yahweh before all the assembly; and David said, “You are blessed,
Yahweh, the God of Israel our father, forever and ever. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,11);</script>Yours, Yahweh, is the greatness,
the power, the glory, the victory, and the majesty! For all that is in the
heavens and in the earth is yours. Yours is the kingdom, Yahweh, and you
are exalted as head above all. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,12);</script>Both riches and honor come from
you, and you rule over all; and in your hand is power and might; and it is
in your hand to make great, and to give strength to all. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,13);</script>Now therefore, our God, we thank
you, and praise your glorious name. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,14);</script>But who am I, and what is my
people, that we should be able to offer so willingly as this? For all
things come from you, and of your own have we given you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,15);</script>For we are strangers before you,
and foreigners, as all our fathers were. Our days on the earth are as a
shadow, and there is no remaining. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,16);</script>Yahweh our God, all this store
that we have prepared to build you a house for your holy name comes from
your hand, and is all your own. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,17);</script>I know also, my God, that you
try the heart, and have pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the
uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things. Now
have I seen with joy your people, that are present here, offer willingly
to you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(29,18);</script>Yahweh, the God
of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this forever in the
imagination of the thoughts of the heart of your people, and prepare their
heart for you; <script type="text/javascript">cb(29,19);</script>and give
to Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep your commandments, your
testimonies, and your statutes, and to do all these things, and to build
the palace, for which I have made provision.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,20);</script>David said to all the assembly,
“Now bless Yahweh your God!”
<p>All the assembly blessed Yahweh, the God of their fathers, and bowed
down their heads and prostrated themselves before Yahweh and the king.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(29,21);</script>They sacrificed
sacrifices to Yahweh, and offered burnt offerings to Yahweh, on the next
day after that day, even one thousand bulls, one thousand rams, and one
thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance
for all Israel, <script type="text/javascript">cb(29,22);</script>and ate
and drink before Yahweh on that day with great gladness. They made Solomon
the son of David king the second time, and anointed him to Yahweh to be
prince, and Zadok to be priest. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,23);</script>Then Solomon sat on the throne
of Yahweh as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all
Israel obeyed him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(29,24);</script>All
the princes, the mighty men, and also all of the sons of king David
submitted themselves to Solomon the king. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,25);</script>Yahweh magnified Solomon
exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed on him such royal
majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,26);</script>Now David the son of Jesse
reigned over all Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,27);</script>The time that he reigned over
Israel was forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron, and he reigned
thirty-three years in Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,28);</script>He died in a good old age, full
of days, riches, and honor: and Solomon his son reigned in his place.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(29,29);</script>Now the acts of David
the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of
Samuel the seer, and in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the
history of Gad the seer, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,30);</script>with all his reign and his
might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the
kingdoms of the countries.
