The First Book of Kings
</h1><p>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,1);</script>Now king David was old and
stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he couldn’t
keep warm. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,2);</script>Therefore his
servants said to him, “Let there be sought for my lord the king a young
virgin. Let her stand before the king, and cherish him; and let her lie in
your bosom, that my lord the king may keep warm.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,3);</script>So they sought for a beautiful
young lady throughout all the borders of Israel, and found Abishag the
Shunammite, and brought her to the king. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,4);</script>The young lady was very beautiful;
and she cherished the king, and ministered to him; but the king didn’t
know her intimately. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,5);</script>Then
Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, “I will be king.”
Then he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before
him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,6);</script>His father had not
displeased him at any time in saying, “Why have you done so?” and he
was also a very handsome man; and he was born after Absalom. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,7);</script>He conferred with Joab the son of
Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped
him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,8);</script>But Zadok the priest,
and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and
Rei, and the mighty men who belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,9);</script>Adonijah killed sheep and
cattle and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En Rogel;
and he called all his brothers, the king’s sons, and all the men of
Judah, the king’s servants: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,10);</script>but Nathan the prophet, and
Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he didn’t call.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,11);</script>Then Nathan spoke to
Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, “Haven’t you heard that
Adonijah the son of Haggith reigns, and David our lord doesn’t know it?
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,12);</script>Now therefore come,
please let me give you counsel, that you may save your own life, and the
life of your son Solomon. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,13);</script>Go in to king David, and tell
him, ‘Didn’t you, my lord, king, swear to your handmaid, saying,
Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my
throne? Why then does Adonijah reign?’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,14);</script>Behold, while you yet talk there
with the king, I also will come in after you, and confirm your words.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,15);</script>Bathsheba went in to
the king into the room. The king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite
was ministering to the king. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,16);</script>Bathsheba bowed, and showed
respect to the king. The king said, “What would you like?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,17);</script>She said to him, “My lord, you
swore by <a href="#N1">Yahweh</a> your <a href="#N2">God</a> to your
handmaid, ‘Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall
sit on my throne.’ <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,18);</script>Now,
behold, Adonijah reigns; and you, my lord the king, don’t know it.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,19);</script>He has slain cattle and
fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has called all the sons of the king,
and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the army; but he hasn’t
called Solomon your servant. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,20);</script>You, my lord the king, the eyes
of all Israel are on you, that you should tell them who shall sit on the
throne of my lord the king after him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,21);</script>Otherwise it will happen, when my
lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon
shall be counted offenders.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,22);</script>Behold, while she yet
talked with the king, Nathan the prophet came in. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,23);</script>They told the king, saying,
“Behold, Nathan the prophet!”
<p>When he had come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king
with his face to the ground. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,24);</script>Nathan said, “My lord, king,
have you said, ‘Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my
throne?’ <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,25);</script>For he is gone
down this day, and has slain cattle and fatlings and sheep in abundance,
and has called all the king’s sons, and the captains of the army, and
Abiathar the priest. Behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and
say, ‘Long live king Adonijah!’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,26);</script>But he hasn’t called me, even
me your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada,
and your servant Solomon. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,27);</script>Is this thing done by my lord the
king, and you haven’t shown to your servants who should sit on the
throne of my lord the king after him?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,28);</script>Then king David
answered, “Call to me Bathsheba.” She came into the king’s presence,
and stood before the king. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,29);</script>The king swore, and said, “As
Yahweh lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,30);</script>most certainly as I swore to you
by Yahweh, the God of Israel, saying, ‘Assuredly Solomon your son shall
reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my place;’ most
certainly so will I do this day.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,31);</script>Then Bathsheba bowed
with her face to the earth, and showed respect to the king, and said,
“Let my lord king David live forever!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,32);</script>King David said,
“Call to me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of
Jehoiada.” They came before the king. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,33);</script>The king said to them, “Take
with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride on my
own mule, and bring him down to Gihon. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,34);</script>Let Zadok the priest and Nathan
the prophet anoint him there king over Israel. Blow the trumpet, and say,
‘Long live king Solomon!’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,35);</script>Then you shall come up after him,
and he shall come and sit on my throne; for he shall be king in my place.
I have appointed him to be prince over Israel and over Judah.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,36);</script>Benaiah the son of
Jehoiada answered the king, and said, “Amen. May Yahweh, the God of my
lord the king, say so. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,37);</script>As
Yahweh has been with my lord the king, even so may he be with Solomon, and
make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,38);</script>So Zadok the priest,
and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the
Cherethites and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride on
king David’s mule, and brought him to Gihon. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,39);</script>Zadok the priest took the horn of
oil out of the Tent, and anointed Solomon. They blew the trumpet; and all
the people said, “Long live king Solomon!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,40);</script>All the people came up
after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy,
so that the earth shook with their sound. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,41);</script>Adonijah and all the guests who
were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. When Joab heard
the sound of the trumpet, he said, “Why is this noise of the city being
in an uproar?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,42);</script>While he yet spoke,
behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said,
“Come in; for you are a worthy man, and bring good news.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,43);</script>Jonathan answered
Adonijah, “Most certainly our lord king David has made Solomon king.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,44);</script>The king has sent with
him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and
the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and they have caused him to ride on
the king’s mule. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,45);</script>Zadok
the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon. They
have come up from there rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is
the noise that you have heard. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,46);</script>Also, Solomon sits on the throne
of the kingdom. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,47);</script>Moreover
the king’s servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, ‘May
your God make the name of Solomon better than your name, and make his
throne greater than your throne;’ and the king bowed himself on the bed.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,48);</script>Also thus said the king,
‘Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who has given one to sit on my
throne this day, my eyes even seeing it.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,49);</script>All the guests of
Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and each man went his way. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,50);</script>Adonijah feared because of
Solomon; and he arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the
altar. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,51);</script>It was told
Solomon, saying, “Behold, Adonijah fears king Solomon; for, behold, he
has laid hold on the horns of the altar, saying, ‘Let king Solomon swear
to me first that he will not kill his servant with the sword.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,52);</script>Solomon said, “If he
shows himself a worthy man, not a hair of him shall fall to the earth; but
if wickedness be found in him, he shall die.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,53);</script>So king Solomon sent,
and they brought him down from the altar. He came and bowed down to king
Solomon; and Solomon said to him, “Go to your house.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,1);</script>Now the days of David
drew near that he should die; and he commanded Solomon his son, saying,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,2);</script>“I am going the way of
all the earth. You be strong therefore, and show yourself a man; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,3);</script>and keep the instruction of Yahweh
your God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, his commandments, his
ordinances, and his testimonies, according to that which is written in the
law of Moses, that you may prosper in all that you do, and wherever you
turn yourself. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,4);</script>That Yahweh
may establish his word which he spoke concerning me, saying, ‘If your
children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their
heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail you,’ he said, ‘a
man on the throne of Israel.’
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,5);</script>“Moreover you know
also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, even what he did to the two
captains of the armies of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa
the son of Jether, whom he killed, and shed the blood of war in peace, and
put the blood of war on his sash that was about his waist, and in his
shoes that were on his feet. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,6);</script>Do therefore according to your
wisdom, and don’t let his gray head go down to <a href="#N3">Sheol</a>
in peace. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,7);</script>But show
kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those
who eat at your table; for so they came to me when I fled from Absalom
your brother.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,8);</script>“Behold, there is
with you Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, of Bahurim, who cursed me
with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim; but he came down
to meet me at the Jordan, and I swore to him by Yahweh, saying, ‘I will
not put you to death with the sword.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,9);</script>Now therefore don’t hold him
guiltless, for you are a wise man; and you will know what you ought to do
to him, and you shall bring his gray head down to <a href="#N4">Sheol</a>
with blood.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,10);</script>David
slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,11);</script>The days that David reigned over
Israel were forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron, and he reigned
thirty-three years in Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,12);</script>Solomon sat on the throne of
David his father; and his kingdom was firmly established. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,13);</script>Then Adonijah the son of Haggith
came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. She said, “Do you come
peaceably?”
<p>He said, “Peaceably. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,14);</script>He said moreover, I have
something to tell you.”
<p>She said, “Say on.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,15);</script>He said, “You know
that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that
I should reign. However the kingdom is turned around, and has become my
brother’s; for it was his from Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,16);</script>Now I ask one petition of you.
Don’t deny me.”
<p>She said to him, “Say on.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,17);</script>He said, “Please speak to
Solomon the king (for he will not tell you ‘no’), that he give me
Abishag the Shunammite as wife.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,18);</script>Bathsheba said,
“Alright. I will speak for you to the king.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,19);</script>Bathsheba therefore
went to king Solomon, to speak to him for Adonijah. The king rose up to
meet her, and bowed himself to her, and sat down on his throne, and caused
a throne to be set for the king’s mother; and she sat on his right hand.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,20);</script>Then she said, “I ask
one small petition of you; don’t deny me.”
<p>The king said to her, “Ask on, my mother; for I will not deny you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,21);</script>She said, “Let
Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as wife.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,22);</script>King Solomon answered
his mother, “Why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask for
him the kingdom also; for he is my elder brother; even for him, and for
Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,23);</script>Then king Solomon swore by
Yahweh, saying, “God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah has not
spoken this word against his own life. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,24);</script>Now therefore as Yahweh lives,
who has established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and
who has made me a house, as he promised, surely Adonijah shall be put to
death this day.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,25);</script>King Solomon sent by
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell on him, so that he died. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,26);</script>To Abiathar the priest the king
said, “Go to Anathoth, to your own fields; for you are worthy of death.
But I will not at this time put you to death, because you bore the ark of
the <a href="#N5">Lord</a> Yahweh before David my father, and because you
were afflicted in all in which my father was afflicted.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,27);</script>So Solomon thrust out Abiathar
from being priest to Yahweh, that he might fulfill the word of Yahweh,
which he spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,28);</script>The news came to Joab;
for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he didn’t turn after Absalom.
Joab fled to the Tent of Yahweh, and caught hold on the horns of the
altar. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,29);</script>It was told king
Solomon, “Joab has fled to the Tent of Yahweh, and behold, he is by the
altar.” Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, “Go,
fall on him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,30);</script>Benaiah came to the
Tent of Yahweh, and said to him, “Thus says the king, ‘Come
forth!’”
<p>He said, “No; but I will die here.”
<p>Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, “Thus said Joab, and
thus he answered me.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,31);</script>The king said to him,
“Do as he has said, and fall on him, and bury him; that you may take
away the blood, which Joab shed without cause, from me and from my
father’s house. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,32);</script>Yahweh
will return his blood on his own head, because he fell on two men more
righteous and better than he, and killed them with the sword, and my
father David didn’t know it: Abner the son of Ner, captain of the army
of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the army of Judah.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,33);</script>So shall their blood
return on the head of Joab, and on the head of his seed forever. But to
David, and to his seed, and to his house, and to his throne, there shall
be peace forever from Yahweh.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,34);</script>Then Benaiah the son
of Jehoiada went up, and fell on him, and killed him; and he was buried in
his own house in the wilderness. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,35);</script>The king put Benaiah the son of
Jehoiada in his place over the army; and the king put Zadok the priest in
the place of Abiathar. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,36);</script>The king sent and called for
Shimei, and said to him, “Build yourself a house in Jerusalem, and dwell
there, and don’t go out from there anywhere. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,37);</script>For on the day you go out, and
pass over the brook Kidron, know for certain that you shall surely die:
your blood shall be on your own head.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,38);</script>Shimei said to the
king, “The saying is good. As my lord the king has said, so will your
servant do.” Shimei lived in Jerusalem many days.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,39);</script>It happened at the end
of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away to Achish, son
of Maacah, king of Gath. They told Shimei, saying, “Behold, your
servants are in Gath.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,40);</script>Shimei arose, and
saddled his donkey, and went to Gath to Achish, to seek his servants; and
Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,41);</script>It was told Solomon that Shimei
had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and had come again.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,42);</script>The king sent and
called for Shimei, and said to him, “Didn’t I adjure you by Yahweh,
and warn you, saying, ‘Know for certain, that on the day you go out, and
walk abroad any where, you shall surely die?’ You said to me, ‘The
saying that I have heard is good.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,43);</script>Why then have you not kept the
oath of Yahweh, and the commandment that I have instructed you with?”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,44);</script>The king said moreover to
Shimei, “You know all the wickedness which your heart is privy to, that
you did to David my father. Therefore Yahweh shall return your wickedness
on your own head. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,45);</script>But
king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be
established before Yahweh forever.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,46);</script>So the king commanded Benaiah the
son of Jehoiada; and he went out, and fell on him, so that he died. The
kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,1);</script>Solomon made affinity
with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh’s daughter, and brought her
into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own
house, and the house of Yahweh, and the wall of Jerusalem all around.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,2);</script>Only the people sacrificed
in the high places, because there was no house built for the name of
Yahweh until those days. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,3);</script>Solomon loved Yahweh, walking in
the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in
the high places. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,4);</script>The king
went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place.
Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,5);</script>In Gibeon Yahweh appeared to
Solomon in a dream by night; and God said, “Ask what I shall give you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,6);</script>Solomon said, “You
have shown to your servant David my father great loving kindness,
according as he walked before you in truth, and in righteousness, and in
uprightness of heart with you. You have kept for him this great loving
kindness, that you have given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is
this day. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,7);</script>Now, Yahweh my
God, you have made your servant king instead of David my father. I am but
a little child. I don’t know how to go out or come in. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,8);</script>Your servant is in the midst of
your people which you have chosen, a great people, that can’t be
numbered nor counted for multitude. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,9);</script>Give your servant therefore an
understanding heart to judge your people, that I may discern between good
and evil; for who is able to judge this your great people?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,10);</script>The speech pleased the
Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,11);</script>God said to him, “Because you
have asked this thing, and have not asked for yourself long life, neither
have asked riches for yourself, nor have asked the life of your enemies,
but have asked for yourself understanding to discern justice; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,12);</script>behold, I have done according to
your word. Behold, I have given you a wise and an understanding heart; so
that there has been none like you before you, neither after you shall any
arise like you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,13);</script>I have
also given you that which you have not asked, both riches and honor, so
that there shall not be any among the kings like you, all your days.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,14);</script>If you will walk in my
ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as your father David
walked, then I will lengthen your days.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,15);</script>Solomon awoke; and
behold, it was a dream. Then he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the
ark of the covenant of Yahweh, and offered up burnt offerings, offered
peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,16);</script>Then two women who
were prostitutes came to the king, and stood before him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,17);</script>The one woman said, “Oh, my
lord, I and this woman dwell in one house. I delivered a child with her in
the house. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,18);</script>It happened
the third day after I delivered, that this woman delivered also. We were
together. There was no stranger with us in the house, just us two in the
house. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,19);</script>This woman’s
child died in the night, because she lay on it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,20);</script>She arose at midnight, and took
my son from beside me, while your handmaid slept, and laid it in her
bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,21);</script>When I rose in the morning to
nurse my child, behold, it was dead; but when I had looked at it in the
morning, behold, it was not my son, whom I bore.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,22);</script>The other woman said,
“No; but the living is my son, and the dead is your son.”
<p>This said, “No; but the dead is your son, and the living is my
son.” Thus they spoke before the king.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,23);</script>Then the king said,
“The one says, ‘This is my son who lives, and your son is the dead;’
and the other says, ‘No; but your son is the dead one, and my son is the
living one.’” <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,24);</script>The
king said, “Get me a sword.” They brought a sword before the king.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,25);</script>The king said, “Divide
the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the
other.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,26);</script>Then the woman whose
the living child was spoke to the king, for her heart yearned over her
son, and she said, “Oh, my lord, give her the living child, and in no
way kill it!”
<p>But the other said, “It shall be neither mine nor yours. Divide it.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,27);</script>Then the king
answered, “Give her the living child, and in no way kill it. She is its
mother.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,28);</script>All Israel heard of
the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they
saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do justice.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,1);</script>King Solomon was king
over all Israel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,2);</script>These
were the princes whom he had: Azariah the son of Zadok, the priest;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,3);</script>Elihoreph and Ahijah, the
sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,4);</script>and Benaiah the son of
Jehoiada was over the army; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,5);</script>and Azariah the son of Nathan was
over the officers; and Zabud the son of Nathan was chief minister, the
king’s friend; <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,6);</script>and
Ahishar was over the household; and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the
men subject to forced labor. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,7);</script>Solomon had twelve officers over
all Israel, who provided food for the king and his household: each man had
to make provision for a month in the year. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,8);</script>These are their names: Ben Hur, in
the hill country of Ephraim; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,9);</script>Ben Deker, in Makaz, and in
Shaalbim, and Beth Shemesh, and Elon Beth Hanan; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,10);</script>Ben Hesed, in Arubboth (to him
belonged Socoh, and all the land of Hepher); <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,11);</script>Ben Abinadab, in all the height
of Dor (he had Taphath the daughter of Solomon as wife); <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,12);</script>Baana the son of Ahilud, in
Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth Shean which is beside Zarethan, beneath
Jezreel, from Beth Shean to Abel Meholah, as far as beyond Jokmeam;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,13);</script>Ben Geber, in Ramoth
Gilead (to him belonged the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are
in Gilead; to him belonged the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, sixty
great cities with walls and bronze bars); <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,14);</script>Ahinadab the son of Iddo, in
Mahanaim; <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,15);</script>Ahimaaz, in
Naphtali (he also took Basemath the daughter of Solomon as wife); <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,16);</script>Baana the son of Hushai, in Asher
and Bealoth; <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,17);</script>Jehoshaphat
the son of Paruah, in Issachar; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,18);</script>Shimei the son of Ela, in
Benjamin; <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,19);</script>Geber the son
of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country of Sihon king of the Amorites
and of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only officer who was in the land.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,20);</script>Judah and Israel were
many as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking and
making merry. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,21);</script>Solomon
ruled over all the kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines,
and to the border of Egypt: they brought tribute, and served Solomon all
the days of his life. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,22);</script>Solomon’s provision for one day
was thirty measures of fine flour, and sixty measures of meal, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,23);</script>ten head of fat cattle, and
twenty head of cattle out of the pastures, and one hundred sheep, besides
harts, and gazelles, and roebucks, and fattened fowl. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,24);</script>For he had dominion over all on
this side the River, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings on this
side the River: and he had peace on all sides around him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,25);</script>Judah and Israel lived safely,
every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to
Beersheba, all the days of Solomon. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,26);</script>Solomon had forty thousand stalls
of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,27);</script>Those officers provided food for
king Solomon, and for all who came to king Solomon’s table, every man in
his month; they let nothing be lacking. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,28);</script>Barley also and straw for the
horses and swift steeds brought they to the place where the officers were,
every man according to his duty. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,29);</script>God gave Solomon wisdom and
understanding exceeding much, and very great understanding, even as the
sand that is on the seashore. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,30);</script>Solomon’s wisdom excelled the
wisdom of all the children of the east, and all the wisdom of Egypt.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,31);</script>For he was wiser than all
men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Calcol, and Darda, the sons
of Mahol: and his fame was in all the nations all around. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,32);</script>He spoke three thousand proverbs;
and his songs were one thousand five. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,33);</script>He spoke of trees, from the cedar
that is in Lebanon even to the hyssop that springs out of the wall; he
spoke also of animals, and of birds, and of creeping things, and of fish.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,34);</script>There came of all peoples
to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, who had heard
of his wisdom.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,1);</script>Hiram king of Tyre sent
his servants to Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king
in the place of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,2);</script>Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(5,3);</script>“You know how that David
my father could not build a house for the name of Yahweh his God for the
wars which were about him on every side, until Yahweh put them under the
soles of his feet. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,4);</script>But now
Yahweh my God has given me rest on every side. There is neither adversary,
nor evil occurrence. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,5);</script>Behold, I purpose to build a house
for the name of Yahweh my God, as Yahweh spoke to David my father, saying,
‘Your son, whom I will set on your throne in your place, he shall build
the house for my name.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,6);</script>Now therefore command that they
cut me cedar trees out of Lebanon. My servants shall be with your
servants; and I will give you wages for your servants according to all
that you shall say. For you know that there is not among us any who knows
how to cut timber like the Sidonians.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,7);</script>It happened, when Hiram
heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, “Blessed
is Yahweh this day, who has given to David a wise son over this great
people.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,8);</script>Hiram sent to
Solomon, saying, “I have heard the message which you have sent to me. I
will do all your desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber
of fir. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,9);</script>My servants shall
bring them down from Lebanon to the sea. I will make them into rafts to go
by sea to the place that you shall appoint me, and will cause them to be
broken up there, and you shall receive them. You shall accomplish my
desire, in giving food for my household.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,10);</script>So Hiram gave Solomon
timber of cedar and timber of fir according to all his desire. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,11);</script>Solomon gave Hiram twenty
thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures
of pure oil. Solomon gave this to Hiram year by year. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,12);</script>Yahweh gave Solomon wisdom, as he
promised him; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two
made a treaty together. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,13);</script>King Solomon raised a levy out of
all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,14);</script>He sent them to Lebanon, ten
thousand a month by courses; a month they were in Lebanon, and two months
at home; and Adoniram was over the men subject to forced labor. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,15);</script>Solomon had seventy thousand who
bore burdens, and eighty thousand who were stone cutters in the mountains;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(5,16);</script>besides Solomon’s chief
officers who were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, who
bore rule over the people who labored in the work. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,17);</script>The king commanded, and they cut
out great stones, costly stones, to lay the foundation of the house with
worked stone. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,18);</script>Solomon’s
builders and Hiram’s builders and the Gebalites cut them, and prepared
the timber and the stones to build the house.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,1);</script>It happened in the four
hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel had come out of
the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in
the month Ziv, which is the second month, that he began to build the house
of Yahweh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,2);</script>The house which
king Solomon built for Yahweh, its length was sixty cubits, and its
breadth twenty, and its height thirty cubits. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,3);</script>The porch before the temple of the
house, twenty cubits was its length, according to the breadth of the
house. Ten cubits was its breadth before the house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,4);</script>For the house he made windows of
fixed lattice work. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,5);</script>Against the wall of the house he
built stories all around, against the walls of the house all around, both
of the temple and of the oracle; and he made side rooms all around.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(6,6);</script>The nethermost story was
five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was
seven cubits broad; for on the outside he made offsets in the wall of the
house all around, that the beams should not have hold in the walls of the
house. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,7);</script>The house, when it
was in building, was built of stone prepared at the quarry; and there was
neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it
was in building. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,8);</script>The door
for the middle side rooms was in the right side of the house: and they
went up by winding stairs into the middle story, and out of the middle
into the third. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,9);</script>So he
built the house, and finished it; and he covered the house with beams and
planks of cedar. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,10);</script>He built
the stories against all the house, each five cubits high: and they rested
on the house with timber of cedar.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,11);</script>The word of Yahweh
came to Solomon, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,12);</script>“Concerning this house which
you are building, if you will walk in my statutes, and execute my
ordinances, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I
establish my word with you, which I spoke to David your father. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,13);</script>I will dwell among the children
of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,14);</script>So Solomon built the
house, and finished it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,15);</script>He built the walls of the house
within with boards of cedar: from the floor of the house to the walls of
the ceiling, he covered them on the inside with wood; and he covered the
floor of the house with boards of fir. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,16);</script>He built twenty cubits on the
hinder part of the house with boards of cedar from the floor to the
ceiling: he built them for it within, for an oracle, even for the most
holy place. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,17);</script>In front of
the temple sanctuary was forty cubits. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,18);</script>There was cedar on the house
within, carved with buds and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no
stone seen. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,19);</script>He prepared
an oracle in the midst of the house within, to set there the ark of the
covenant of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,20);</script>Within the oracle was twenty
cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in its
height; and he overlaid it with pure gold: and he covered the altar with
cedar. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,21);</script>So Solomon
overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he drew chains of gold
across before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,22);</script>The whole house he overlaid with
gold, until all the house was finished: also the whole altar that belonged
to the oracle he overlaid with gold. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,23);</script>In the oracle he made two
cherubim of olive wood, each ten cubits high. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,24);</script>Five cubits was the one wing of
the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the
uttermost part of the one wing to the uttermost part of the other were ten
cubits. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,25);</script>The other cherub
was ten cubits: both the cherubim were of one measure and one form.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(6,26);</script>The height of the one
cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,27);</script>He set the cherubim within the
inner house; and the wings of the cherubim were stretched forth, so that
the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub
touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst
of the house. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,28);</script>He overlaid
the cherubim with gold. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,29);</script>He carved all the walls of the
house around with carved figures of cherubim and palm trees and open
flowers, inside and outside. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,30);</script>The floor of the house he
overlaid with gold, inside and outside. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,31);</script>For the entrance of the oracle he
made doors of olive wood: the lintel and door posts were a fifth part of
the wall. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,32);</script>So he made two
doors of olive wood; and he carved on them carvings of cherubim and palm
trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold; and he spread the
gold on the cherubim, and on the palm trees. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,33);</script>So also made he for the entrance
of the temple door posts of olive wood, out of a fourth part of the wall;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(6,34);</script>and two doors of fir
wood: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of
the other door were folding. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,35);</script>He carved cherubim and palm trees
and open flowers; and he overlaid them with gold fitted on the engraved
work. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,36);</script>He built the inner
court with three courses of cut stone, and a course of cedar beams.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(6,37);</script>In the fourth year was
the foundation of the house of Yahweh laid, in the month Ziv. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,38);</script>In the eleventh year, in the
month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout
all its parts, and according to all its fashion. So was he seven years in
building it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,1);</script>Solomon was building
his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,2);</script>For he built the house of the
forest of Lebanon; its length was one hundred cubits, and its breadth
fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits, on four rows of cedar pillars,
with cedar beams on the pillars. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,3);</script>It was covered with cedar above
over the forty-five beams, that were on the pillars; fifteen in a row.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,4);</script>There were beams in three
rows, and window was over against window in three ranks. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,5);</script>All the doors and posts were made
square with beams: and window was over against window in three ranks.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,6);</script>He made the porch of
pillars; its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth thirty cubits; and a
porch before them; and pillars and a threshold before them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,7);</script>He made the porch of the throne
where he was to judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with
cedar from floor to floor. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,8);</script>His house where he was to dwell,
the other court within the porch, was of the like work. He made also a
house for Pharaoh’s daughter (whom Solomon had taken as wife), like this
porch. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,9);</script>All these were of
costly stones, even of cut stone, according to measure, sawed with saws,
inside and outside, even from the foundation to the coping, and so on the
outside to the great court. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,10);</script>The foundation was of costly
stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight
cubits. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,11);</script>Above were costly
stones, even cut stone, according to measure, and cedar wood. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,12);</script>The great court around had three
courses of cut stone, and a course of cedar beams; like as the inner court
of the house of Yahweh, and the porch of the house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,13);</script>King Solomon sent and fetched
Hiram out of Tyre. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,14);</script>He was
the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of
Tyre, a worker in brass; and he was filled with wisdom and understanding
and skill, to work all works in brass. He came to king Solomon, and
performed all his work. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,15);</script>For he fashioned the two pillars
of brass, eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits
encircled either of them about. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,16);</script>He made two capitals of molten
brass, to set on the tops of the pillars: the height of the one capital
was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,17);</script>There were nets of
checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the capitals which were on
the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital, and seven for the other
capital. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,18);</script>So he made the
pillars; and there were two rows around on the one network, to cover the
capitals that were on the top of the pillars: and he did so for the other
capital. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,19);</script>The capitals
that were on the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily work, four
cubits. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,20);</script>There were
capitals above also on the two pillars, close by the belly which was
beside the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred, in rows around
on the other capital. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,21);</script>He
set up the pillars at the porch of the temple: and he set up the right
pillar, and called its name Jachin; and he set up the left pillar, and
called its name Boaz. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,22);</script>On
the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of the pillars
finished. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,23);</script>He made the
molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and its
height was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits encircled it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,24);</script>Under its brim around there were
buds which encircled it, for ten cubits, encircling the sea: the buds were
in two rows, cast when it was cast. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,25);</script>It stood on twelve oxen, three
looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three
looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea
was set on them above, and all their hinder parts were inward. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,26);</script>It was a handbreadth thick: and
its brim was worked like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily: it
held two thousand baths. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,27);</script>He made the ten bases of brass;
four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits its breadth, and
three cubits its height. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,28);</script>The work of the bases was like
this: they had panels; and there were panels between the ledges; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,29);</script>and on the panels that were
between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubim; and on the ledges there
was a pedestal above; and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of
hanging work. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,30);</script>Every base
had four bronze wheels, and axles of brass; and the four feet of it had
supports: beneath the basin were the supports molten, with wreaths at the
side of each. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,31);</script>The mouth
of it within the capital and above was a cubit: and its mouth was round
after the work of a pedestal, a cubit and a half; and also on its mouth
were engravings, and their panels were foursquare, not round. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,32);</script>The four wheels were underneath
the panels; and the axles of the wheels were in the base: and the height
of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,33);</script>The work of the wheels was like
the work of a chariot wheel: their axles, and their rims, and their
spokes, and their naves, were all molten. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,34);</script>There were four supports at the
four corners of each base: its supports were of the base itself. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,35);</script>In the top of the base was there
a round compass half a cubit high; and on the top of the base its stays
and its panels were of the same. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,36);</script>On the plates of its stays, and
on its panels, he engraved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to
the space of each, with wreaths all around. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,37);</script>In this way, he made the ten
bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one form. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,38);</script>He made ten basins of brass: one
basin contained forty baths; and every basin was four cubits; and on every
one of the ten bases one basin. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,39);</script>He set the bases, five on the
right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he
set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,40);</script>Hiram made the basins,
and the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram made an end of doing all the
work that he worked for king Solomon in the house of Yahweh: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,41);</script>the two pillars, and the two
bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; and the two
networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of
the pillars; <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,42);</script>and the four
hundred pomegranates for the two networks; two rows of pomegranates for
each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the
pillars; <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,43);</script>and the ten
bases, and the ten basins on the bases; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,44);</script>and the one sea, and the twelve
oxen under the sea; <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,45);</script>and
the pots, and the shovels, and the basins: even all these vessels, which
Hiram made for king Solomon, in the house of Yahweh, were of burnished
brass. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,46);</script>The king cast them
in the plain of the Jordan, in the clay ground between Succoth and
Zarethan. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,47);</script>Solomon left
all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many: the weight of
the brass could not be found out. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,48);</script>Solomon made all the vessels that
were in the house of Yahweh: the golden altar, and the table whereupon the
show bread was, of gold; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,49);</script>and the lampstands, five on the
right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, of pure gold; and the
flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,50);</script>and the cups, and the snuffers,
and the basins, and the spoons, and the fire pans, of pure gold; and the
hinges, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and
for the doors of the house, of the temple, of gold. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,51);</script>Thus all the work that king
Solomon worked in the house of Yahweh was finished. Solomon brought in the
things which David his father had dedicated, the silver, and the gold, and
the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of Yahweh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,1);</script>Then Solomon assembled
the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the
fathers’ households of the children of Israel, to king Solomon in
Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of the city
of David, which is Zion. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,2);</script>All the men of Israel assembled
themselves to king Solomon at the feast, in the month Ethanim, which is
the seventh month. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,3);</script>All the
elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,4);</script>They brought up the ark of Yahweh,
and the Tent of Meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent;
even these the priests and the Levites brought up. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,5);</script>King Solomon and all the
congregation of Israel, who were assembled to him, were with him before
the ark, sacrificing sheep and cattle, that could not be counted nor
numbered for multitude. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,6);</script>The priests brought in the ark of
the covenant of Yahweh to its place, into the oracle of the house, to the
most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,7);</script>For the cherubim spread forth
their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark
and its poles above. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,8);</script>The
poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the holy
place before the oracle; but they were not seen outside: and there they
are to this day. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,9);</script>There was
nothing in the ark except the two tables of stone which Moses put there at
Horeb, when Yahweh made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they
came out of the land of Egypt. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,10);</script>It came to pass, when the priests
had come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of Yahweh,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,11);</script>so that the priests could
not stand to minister by reason of the cloud; for the glory of Yahweh
filled the house of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,12);</script>Then Solomon said, “Yahweh has
said that he would dwell in the thick darkness. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,13);</script>I have surely built you a house
of habitation, a place for you to dwell in forever.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,14);</script>The king turned his
face about, and blessed all the assembly of Israel: and all the assembly
of Israel stood. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,15);</script>He said,
“Blessed is Yahweh, the God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth to David
your father, and has with his hand fulfilled it, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,16);</script>‘Since the day that I brought
my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of
Israel to build a house, that my name might be there; but I chose David to
be over my people Israel.’
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,17);</script>“Now it was in the
heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Yahweh, the God
of Israel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,18);</script>But Yahweh
said to David my father, ‘Whereas it was in your heart to build a house
for my name, you did well that it was in your heart. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,19);</script>Nevertheless, you shall not build
the house; but your son who shall come forth out of your body, he shall
build the house for my name.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,20);</script>Yahweh has established his word
that he spoke; for I have risen up in the place of David my father, and I
sit on the throne of Israel, as Yahweh promised, and have built the house
for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,21);</script>There I have set a place for the
ark, in which is the covenant of Yahweh, which he made with our fathers,
when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,22);</script>Solomon stood before
the altar of Yahweh in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and
spread forth his hands toward heaven; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,23);</script>and he said, “Yahweh, the God
of Israel, there is no God like you, in heaven above, or on earth beneath;
who keep covenant and loving kindness with your servants, who walk before
you with all their heart; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,24);</script>who have kept with your servant
David my father that which you promised him. Yes, you spoke with your
mouth, and have fulfilled it with your hand, as it is this day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,25);</script>Now therefore, may Yahweh, the
God of Israel, keep with your servant David my father that which you have
promised him, saying, ‘There shall not fail you a man in my sight to sit
on the throne of Israel, if only your children take heed to their way, to
walk before me as you have walked before me.’
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,26);</script>“Now therefore, God
of Israel, please let your word be verified, which you spoke to your
servant David my father. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,27);</script>But will God in very deed dwell
on the earth? Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens can’t contain
you; how much less this house that I have built! <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,28);</script>Yet have respect for the prayer
of your servant, and for his supplication, Yahweh my God, to listen to the
cry and to the prayer which your servant prays before you this day;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,29);</script>that your eyes may be
open toward this house night and day, even toward the place of which you
have said, ‘My name shall be there;’ to listen to the prayer which
your servant shall pray toward this place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,30);</script>Listen to the supplication of
your servant, and of your people Israel, when they shall pray toward this
place. Yes, hear in heaven, your dwelling place; and when you hear,
forgive.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,31);</script>“If a man sins
against his neighbor, and an oath is laid on him to cause him to swear,
and he comes and swear before your altar in this house; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,32);</script>then hear in heaven, and do, and
judge your servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way on his own
head, and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his
righteousness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,33);</script>“When your people
Israel are struck down before the enemy, because they have sinned against
you; if they turn again to you, and confess your name, and pray and make
supplication to you in this house: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,34);</script>then hear in heaven, and forgive
the sin of your people Israel, and bring them again to the land which you
gave to their fathers.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,35);</script>“When the sky is
shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against you; if
they pray toward this place, and confess your name, and turn from their
sin, when you afflict them: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,36);</script>then hear in heaven, and forgive
the sin of your servants, and of your people Israel, when you teach them
the good way in which they should walk; and send rain on your land, which
you have given to your people for an inheritance.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,37);</script>“If there is famine
in the land, if there is pestilence, if there is blight, mildew, locust or
caterpillar; if their enemy besieges them in the land of their cities;
whatever plague, whatever sickness there is; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,38);</script>whatever prayer and supplication
is made by any man, or by all your people Israel, who shall each know the
plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house:
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,39);</script>then hear in heaven, your
dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and render to every man according to
all his ways, whose heart you know; (for you, even you only, know the
hearts of all the children of men;) <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,40);</script>that they may fear you all the
days that they live in the land which you gave to our fathers.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,41);</script>“Moreover concerning
the foreigner, who is not of your people Israel, when he shall come out of
a far country for your name’s sake <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,42);</script>(for they shall hear of your
great name, and of your mighty hand, and of your outstretched arm); when
he shall come and pray toward this house; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,43);</script>hear in heaven, your dwelling
place, and do according to all that the foreigner calls to you for; that
all the peoples of the earth may know your name, to fear you, as do your
people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built
is called by your name.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,44);</script>“If your people go
out to battle against their enemy, by whatever way you shall send them,
and they pray to Yahweh toward the city which you have chosen, and toward
the house which I have built for your name; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,45);</script>then hear in heaven their prayer
and their supplication, and maintain their cause. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,46);</script>If they sin against you (for
there is no man who doesn’t sin), and you are angry with them, and
deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive to the
land of the enemy, far off or near; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,47);</script>yet if they shall repent in the
land where they are carried captive, and turn again, and make supplication
to you in the land of those who carried them captive, saying, ‘We have
sinned, and have done perversely; we have dealt wickedly;’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,48);</script>if they return to you with all
their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies, who
carried them captive, and pray to you toward their land, which you gave to
their fathers, the city which you have chosen, and the house which I have
built for your name: <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,49);</script>then
hear their prayer and their supplication in heaven, your dwelling place,
and maintain their cause; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,50);</script>and forgive your people who have
sinned against you, and all their transgressions in which they have
transgressed against you; and give them compassion before those who
carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,51);</script>(for they are your people, and
your inheritance, which you brought out of Egypt, from the midst of the
furnace of iron); <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,52);</script>that
your eyes may be open to the supplication of your servant, and to the
supplication of your people Israel, to listen to them whenever they cry to
you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,53);</script>For you separated
them from among all the peoples of the earth, to be your inheritance, as
you spoke by Moses your servant, when you brought our fathers out of
Egypt, Lord Yahweh.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,54);</script>It was so, that when
Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication to
Yahweh, he arose from before the altar of Yahweh, from kneeling on his
knees with his hands spread forth toward heaven. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,55);</script>He stood, and blessed all the
assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,56);</script>“Blessed be Yahweh, who has
given rest to his people Israel, according to all that he promised. There
has not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by
Moses his servant. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,57);</script>May
Yahweh our God be with us, as he was with our fathers. Let him not leave
us, nor forsake us; <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,58);</script>that
he may incline our hearts to him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his
commandments, and his statutes, and his ordinances, which he commanded our
fathers. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,59);</script>Let these my
words, with which I have made supplication before Yahweh, be near to
Yahweh our God day and night, that he may maintain the cause of his
servant, and the cause of his people Israel, as every day shall require;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,60);</script>that all the peoples of
the earth may know that Yahweh, he is God. There is none else.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,61);</script>“Let your heart
therefore be perfect with Yahweh our God, to walk in his statutes, and to
keep his commandments, as at this day.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,62);</script>The king, and all
Israel with him, offered sacrifice before Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,63);</script>Solomon offered for the sacrifice
of peace offerings, which he offered to Yahweh, two and twenty thousand
head of cattle, and one hundred twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all
the children of Israel dedicated the house of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,64);</script>The same day the king made the
middle of the court holy that was before the house of Yahweh; for there he
offered the burnt offering, and the meal offering, and the fat of the
peace offerings, because the bronze altar that was before Yahweh was too
little to receive the burnt offering, and the meal offering, and the fat
of the peace offerings. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,65);</script>So Solomon held the feast at that
time, and all Israel with him, a great assembly, from the entrance of
Hamath to the brook of Egypt, before Yahweh our God, seven days and seven
days, even fourteen days. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,66);</script>On the eighth day he sent the
people away; and they blessed the king, and went to their tents joyful and
glad of heart for all the goodness that Yahweh had shown to David his
servant, and to Israel his people.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,1);</script>It happened, when
Solomon had finished the building of the house of Yahweh, and the king’s
house, and all Solomon’s desire which he was pleased to do, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,2);</script>that Yahweh appeared to Solomon
the second time, as he had appeared to him at Gibeon. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,3);</script>Yahweh said to him, “I have
heard your prayer and your supplication, that you have made before me. I
have made this house holy, which you have built, to put my name there
forever; and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,4);</script>As for you, if you will walk
before me, as David your father walked, in integrity of heart, and in
uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded you, and will
keep my statutes and my ordinances; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,5);</script>then I will establish the throne
of your kingdom over Israel forever, according as I promised to David your
father, saying, ‘There shall not fail you a man on the throne of
Israel.’ <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,6);</script>But if you turn
away from following me, you or your children, and not keep my commandments
and my statutes which I have set before you, but shall go and serve other
gods, and worship them; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,7);</script>then will I cut off Israel out of
the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have made holy
for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb
and a byword among all peoples. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,8);</script>Though this house is so high, yet
shall everyone who passes by it be astonished, and shall hiss; and they
shall say, ‘Why has Yahweh done thus to this land, and to this house?’
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,9);</script>and they shall answer,
‘Because they forsook Yahweh their God, who brought their fathers out of
the land of Egypt, and laid hold of other gods, and worshiped them, and
served them. Therefore Yahweh has brought all this evil on them.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,10);</script>It happened at the end
of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the two houses, the house of
Yahweh and the king’s house <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,11);</script>(now Hiram the king of Tyre had
furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according
to all his desire), that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the
land of Galilee. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,12);</script>Hiram
came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they
didn’t please him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,13);</script>He
said, “What cities are these which you have given me, my brother?” He
called them the land of Cabul to this day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,14);</script>Hiram sent to the king one
hundred twenty talents of gold.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,15);</script>This is the reason of
the levy which king Solomon raised, to build the house of Yahweh, and his
own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo,
and Gezer. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,16);</script>Pharaoh king
of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain
the Canaanites who lived in the city, and given it for a portion to his
daughter, Solomon’s wife. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,17);</script>Solomon built Gezer, and Beth
Horon the lower, <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,18);</script>and
Baalath, and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,19);</script>and all the storage cities that
Solomon had, and the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his
horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in
Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,20);</script>As for all the people who were
left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the
Jebusites, who were not of the children of Israel; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,21);</script>their children who were left
after them in the land, whom the children of Israel were not able utterly
to destroy, of them Solomon raised a levy of bondservants to this day.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,22);</script>But of the children of
Israel Solomon made no bondservants; but they were the men of war, and his
servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots
and of his horsemen. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,23);</script>These were the chief officers who
were over Solomon’s work, five hundred fifty, who bore rule over the
people who labored in the work. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,24);</script>But Pharaoh’s daughter came up
out of the city of David to her house which Solomon had built for her:
then he built Millo. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,25);</script>Solomon offered burnt offerings
and peace offerings on the altar which he built to Yahweh three times a
year, burning incense with them, on the altar that was before Yahweh. So
he finished the house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,26);</script>King Solomon made a navy of ships
in Ezion Geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the <a
href="#N6">Red Sea</a>, in the land of Edom. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,27);</script>Hiram sent in the navy his
servants, sailors who had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of
Solomon. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,28);</script>They came to
Ophir, and fetched from there gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and
brought it to king Solomon.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,1);</script>When the queen of
Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of Yahweh, she came
to prove him with hard questions. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,2);</script>She came to Jerusalem with a very
great train, with camels that bore spices, and very much gold, and
precious stones; and when she had come to Solomon, she talked with him of
all that was in her heart. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,3);</script>Solomon told her all her
questions: there was not anything hidden from the king which he didn’t
tell her. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,4);</script>When the queen
of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had
built, <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,5);</script>and the food of
his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his
ministers, and their clothing, and his cup bearers, and his ascent by
which he went up to the house of Yahweh; there was no more spirit in her.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(10,6);</script>She said to the king,
“It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts, and of
your wisdom. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,7);</script>However I
didn’t believe the words, until I came, and my eyes had seen it. Behold,
the half was not told me! Your wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame which
I heard. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,8);</script>Happy are your
men, happy are these your servants, who stand continually before you, who
hear your wisdom. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,9);</script>Blessed
is Yahweh your God, who delighted in you, to set you on the throne of
Israel. Because Yahweh loved Israel forever, therefore made he you king,
to do justice and righteousness.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,10);</script>She gave the king one hundred
twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious
stones. There came no more such abundance of spices as these which the
queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,11);</script>The navy also of
Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of
almug trees and precious stones. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,12);</script>The king made of the almug trees
pillars for the house of Yahweh, and for the king’s house, harps also
and stringed instruments for the singers: there came no such almug trees,
nor were seen, to this day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,13);</script>King Solomon gave to the queen
of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, besides that which Solomon
gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned, and went to her own land, she
and her servants. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,14);</script>Now
the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred
sixty-six talents of gold, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,15);</script>besides that which the traders
brought, and the traffic of the merchants, and of all the kings of the
mixed people, and of the governors of the country. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,16);</script>King Solomon made two hundred
bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred shekels of gold went to one buckler.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(10,17);</script>he made three hundred
shields of beaten gold; three minas of gold went to one shield: and the
king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,18);</script>Moreover the king made a great
throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the finest gold. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,19);</script>There were six steps to the
throne, and the top of the throne was round behind; and there were stays
on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the
stays. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,20);</script>Twelve lions
stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps: there was
nothing like it made in any kingdom. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,21);</script>All king Solomon’s drinking
vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of
Lebanon were of pure gold: none were of silver; it was nothing accounted
of in the days of Solomon. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,22);</script>For the king had at sea a navy
of Tarshish with the navy of Hiram: once every three years came the navy
of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(10,23);</script>So king Solomon exceeded
all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,24);</script>All the earth sought the
presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(10,25);</script>They brought every man
his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and clothing, and
armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,26);</script>Solomon gathered together
chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots,
and twelve thousand horsemen, that he bestowed in the chariot cities, and
with the king at Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,27);</script>The king made silver to be in
Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycamore trees that
are in the lowland, for abundance. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,28);</script>The horses which Solomon had
were brought out of Egypt; and the king’s merchants received them in
droves, each drove at a price. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,29);</script>A chariot came up and went out
of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for one hundred
fifty; and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of
Syria, they brought them out by their means.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,1);</script>Now king Solomon loved
many foreign women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the
Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,2);</script>of the nations concerning which
Yahweh said to the children of Israel, “You shall not go among them,
neither shall they come among you; for surely they will turn away your
heart after their gods.” Solomon joined to these in love. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,3);</script>He had seven hundred wives,
princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his
heart. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,4);</script>For it happened,
when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other
gods; and his heart was not perfect with Yahweh his God, as was the heart
of David his father. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,5);</script>For
Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after
Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,6);</script>Solomon did that which was evil
in the sight of Yahweh, and didn’t go fully after Yahweh, as did David
his father. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,7);</script>Then Solomon
built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, on the mountain
that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech the abomination of the children
of Ammon. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,8);</script>So he did for
all his foreign wives, who burnt incense and sacrificed to their gods.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,9);</script>Yahweh was angry with
Solomon, because his heart was turned away from Yahweh, the God of Israel,
who had appeared to him twice, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,10);</script>and had commanded him concerning
this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he didn’t keep
that which Yahweh commanded. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,11);</script>Therefore Yahweh said to
Solomon, “Because this is done by you, and you have not kept my covenant
and my statutes, which I have commanded you, I will surely tear the
kingdom from you, and will give it to your servant. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,12);</script>Notwithstanding I will not do it
in your days, for David your father’s sake; but I will tear it out of
the hand of your son. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,13);</script>However I will not tear away all
the kingdom; but I will give one tribe to your son, for David my
servant’s sake, and for Jerusalem’s sake which I have chosen.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,14);</script>Yahweh raised up an
adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king’s seed in
Edom. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,15);</script>For it happened,
when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the army was gone up to
bury the slain, and had struck every male in Edom <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,16);</script>(for Joab and all Israel
remained there six months, until he had cut off every male in Edom);
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,17);</script>that Hadad fled, he and
certain Edomites of his father’s servants with him, to go into Egypt,
Hadad being yet a little child. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,18);</script>They arose out of Midian, and
came to Paran; and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to
Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house, and appointed him
food, and gave him land. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,19);</script>Hadad found great favor in the
sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him as wife the sister of his own wife,
the sister of Tahpenes the queen. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,20);</script>The sister of Tahpenes bore him
Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh’s house; and Genubath
was in Pharaoh’s house among the sons of Pharaoh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,21);</script>When Hadad heard in Egypt that
David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the army was
dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, “Let me depart, that I may go to my own
country.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,22);</script>Then Pharaoh said to
him, “But what have you lacked with me, that behold, you seek to go to
your own country?”
<p>He answered, “Nothing, however only let me depart.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,23);</script>God raised up an
adversary to him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord
Hadadezer king of Zobah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,24);</script>He gathered men to him, and
became captain over a troop, when David killed them of Zobah: and they
went to Damascus, and lived therein, and reigned in Damascus. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,25);</script>He was an adversary to Israel
all the days of Solomon, besides the mischief of Hadad: and he abhorred
Israel, and reigned over Syria. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,26);</script>Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an
Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother’s name was
Zeruah, a widow, he also lifted up his hand against the king. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,27);</script>This was the reason why he
lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the
breach of the city of David his father. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,28);</script>The man Jeroboam was a mighty
man of valor; and Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious, and
he put him in charge of all the labor of the house of Joseph. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,29);</script>It happened at that time, when
Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite
found him in the way; now Ahijah had clad himself with a new garment; and
they two were alone in the field. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,30);</script>Ahijah laid hold of the new
garment that was on him, and tore it in twelve pieces. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,31);</script>He said to Jeroboam, “Take ten
pieces; for thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, ‘Behold, I will tear
the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to you
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,32);</script>(but he shall have one
tribe, for my servant David’s sake and for Jerusalem’s sake, the city
which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel); <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,33);</script>because that they have forsaken
me, and have worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the
god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon. They have not
walked in my ways, to do that which is right in my eyes, and to keep my
statutes and my ordinances, as David his father did.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,34);</script>“‘However I will
not take the whole kingdom out of his hand; but I will make him prince all
the days of his life, for David my servant’s sake whom I chose, who kept
my commandments and my statutes; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,35);</script>but I will take the kingdom out
of his son’s hand, and will give it to you, even ten tribes. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,36);</script>To his son will I give one
tribe, that David my servant may have a lamp always before me in
Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,37);</script>I will take you, and you shall
reign according to all that your soul desires, and shall be king over
Israel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,38);</script>It shall be, if
you will listen to all that I command you, and will walk in my ways, and
do that which is right in my eyes, to keep my statutes and my
commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with you, and will
build you a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel to you.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,39);</script>I will for this afflict
the seed of David, but not forever.’” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,40);</script>Solomon sought therefore to kill
Jeroboam; but Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of
Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,41);</script>Now the rest of the acts of
Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, aren’t they written in the
book of the acts of Solomon? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,42);</script>The time that Solomon reigned in
Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,43);</script>Solomon slept with his fathers,
and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son
reigned in his place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,1);</script>Rehoboam went to
Shechem: for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,2);</script>It happened, when Jeroboam the
son of Nebat heard of it (for he was yet in Egypt, where he had fled from
the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam lived in Egypt, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,3);</script>and they sent and called him),
that Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came, and spoke to Rehoboam,
saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,4);</script>“Your father
made our yoke grievous: now therefore make you the grievous service of
your father, and his heavy yoke which he put on us, lighter, and we will
serve you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,5);</script>He said to them,
“Depart for three days, then come back to me.”
<p>The people departed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,6);</script>King Rehoboam took counsel with
the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived,
saying, “What counsel do you give me to return answer to this people?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,7);</script>They spoke to him,
saying, “If you will be a servant to this people this day, and will
serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will
be your servants forever.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,8);</script>But he forsook the
counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the
young men who had grown up with him, who stood before him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,9);</script>He said to them, “What counsel
do you give, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to
me, saying, ‘Make the yoke that your father put on us lighter?’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,10);</script>The young men who had
grown up with him spoke to him, saying, “Thus you shall tell this people
who spoke to you, saying, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but make it
lighter to us;’ you shall say to them, ‘My little finger is thicker
than my father’s waist. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,11);</script>Now whereas my father burdened
you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you
with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,12);</script>So Jeroboam and all
the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king asked, saying,
“Come to me again the third day.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,13);</script>The king answered the people
roughly, and forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(12,14);</script>and spoke to them
according to the counsel of the young men, saying, “My father made your
yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke. My father chastised you with
whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,15);</script>So the king didn’t
listen to the people; for it was a thing brought about of Yahweh, that he
might establish his word, which Yahweh spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to
Jeroboam the son of Nebat. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,16);</script>When all Israel saw that the
king didn’t listen to them, the people answered the king, saying,
“What portion have we in David? Neither do we have an inheritance in the
son of Jesse. To your tents, Israel! Now see to your own house, David.”
So Israel departed to their tents.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,17);</script>But as for the
children of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over
them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,18);</script>Then king Rehoboam
sent Adoram, who was over the men subject to forced labor; and all Israel
stoned him to death with stones. King Rehoboam made speed to get him up to
his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,19);</script>So Israel rebelled against the
house of David to this day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,20);</script>It happened, when all Israel
heard that Jeroboam was returned, that they sent and called him to the
congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none who
followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,21);</script>When Rehoboam had come to
Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, and the tribe of Benjamin,
a hundred and eighty thousand chosen men, who were warriors, to fight
against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the
son of Solomon. <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,22);</script>But the
word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,23);</script>“Speak to Rehoboam the son of
Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to
the rest of the people, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,24);</script>‘Thus says Yahweh, “You
shall not go up, nor fight against your brothers, the children of Israel.
Everyone return to his house; for this thing is of me.”’” So they
listened to the word of Yahweh, and returned and went their way, according
to the word of Yahweh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,25);</script>Then Jeroboam built
Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and lived in it; and he went out
from there, and built Penuel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,26);</script>Jeroboam said in his heart,
“Now the kingdom will return to the house of David. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,27);</script>If this people goes up to offer
sacrifices in the house of Yahweh at Jerusalem, then the heart of this
people will turn again to their lord, even to Rehoboam king of Judah; and
they will kill me, and return to Rehoboam king of Judah.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,28);</script>Whereupon the king took counsel,
and made two calves of gold; and he said to them, “It is too much for
you to go up to Jerusalem. Look and see your gods, Israel, which brought
you up out of the land of Egypt!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,29);</script>He set the one in Bethel, and
the other put he in Dan. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,30);</script>This thing became a sin; for the
people went to worship before the one, even to Dan. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,31);</script>He made houses of high places,
and made priests from among all the people, who were not of the sons of
Levi. <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,32);</script>Jeroboam ordained
a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like the
feast that is in Judah, and he went up to the altar; he did so in Bethel,
sacrificing to the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the
priests of the high places that he had made. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,33);</script>He went up to the altar which he
had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, even in the
month which he had devised of his own heart: and he ordained a feast for
the children of Israel, and went up to the altar, to burn incense.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,1);</script>Behold, there came a
man of God out of Judah by the word of Yahweh to Beth El: and Jeroboam was
standing by the altar to burn incense. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,2);</script>He cried against the altar by the
word of Yahweh, and said, “Altar, altar, thus says Yahweh: ‘Behold, a
son shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name. On you he shall
sacrifice the priests of the high places who burn incense on you, and they
will burn men’s bones on you.’” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,3);</script>He gave a sign the same day,
saying, “This is the sign which Yahweh has spoken: Behold, the altar
will be split apart, and the ashes that are on it will be poured out.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,4);</script>It happened, when the
king heard the saying of the man of God, which he cried against the altar
in Bethel, that Jeroboam put out his hand from the altar, saying, “Seize
him!” His hand, which he put out against him, dried up, so that he could
not draw it back again to himself. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,5);</script>The altar also was split apart,
and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the
man of God had given by the word of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,6);</script>The king answered the man of God,
“Now entreat the favor of Yahweh your God, and pray for me, that my hand
may be restored me again.”
<p>The man of God entreated Yahweh, and the king’s hand was restored him
again, and became as it was before.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,7);</script>The king said to the
man of God, “Come home with me, and refresh yourself, and I will give
you a reward.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,8);</script>The man of God said to
the king, “Even if you gave me half of your house, I would not go in
with you, neither would I eat bread nor drink water in this place; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,9);</script>for so was it commanded me by the
word of Yahweh, saying, ‘You shall eat no bread, nor drink water,
neither return by the way that you came.’” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,10);</script>So he went another way, and
didn’t return by the way that he came to Bethel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,11);</script>Now there lived an
old prophet in Bethel; and one of his sons came and told him all the works
that the man of God had done that day in Bethel. They also told their
father the words which he had spoken to the king.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,12);</script>Their father said to
them, “Which way did he go?” Now his sons had seen which way the man
of God went, who came from Judah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,13);</script>He said to his sons, “Saddle
the donkey for me.” So they saddled the donkey for him; and he rode on
it. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,14);</script>He went after the
man of God, and found him sitting under an oak. He said to him, “Are you
the man of God who came from Judah?”
<p>He said, “I am.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,15);</script>Then he said to him, “Come
home with me, and eat bread.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,16);</script>He said, “I may not
return with you, nor go in with you; neither will I eat bread nor drink
water with you in this place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,17);</script>For it was said to me by the
word of Yahweh, ‘You shall eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn
again to go by the way that you came.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,18);</script>He said to him, “I
also am a prophet as you are; and an angel spoke to me by the word of
Yahweh, saying, ‘Bring him back with you into your house, that he may
eat bread and drink water.’” He lied to him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,19);</script>So he went back with
him, and ate bread in his house, and drank water. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,20);</script>It happened, as they sat at the
table, that the word of Yahweh came to the prophet who brought him back;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,21);</script>and he cried to the man
of God who came from Judah, saying, “Thus says Yahweh, ‘Because you
have been disobedient to the mouth of Yahweh, and have not kept the
commandment which Yahweh your God commanded you, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,22);</script>but came back, and have eaten
bread and drunk water in the place of which he said to you, “Eat no
bread, and drink no water”; your body shall not come to the tomb of your
fathers.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,23);</script>It happened, after he
had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled the donkey for
the prophet whom he had brought back. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,24);</script>When he had gone, a lion met him
by the way, and killed him. His body was cast in the way, and the donkey
stood by it. The lion also stood by the body. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,25);</script>Behold, men passed by, and saw
the body cast in the way, and the lion standing by the body; and they came
and told it in the city where the old prophet lived. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,26);</script>When the prophet who brought him
back from the way heard of it, he said, “It is the man of God who was
disobedient to the mouth of Yahweh. Therefore Yahweh has delivered him to
the lion, which has mauled him and slain him, according to the word of
Yahweh, which he spoke to him.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,27);</script>He spoke to his sons, saying,
“Saddle the donkey for me.” They saddled it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,28);</script>He went and found his body cast
in the way, and the donkey and the lion standing by the body. The lion had
not eaten the body, nor mauled the donkey. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,29);</script>The prophet took up the body of
the man of God, and laid it on the donkey, and brought it back. He came to
the city of the old prophet to mourn, and to bury him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,30);</script>He laid his body in his own
grave; and they mourned over him, saying, “Alas, my brother!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,31);</script>It happened, after he
had buried him, that he spoke to his sons, saying, “When I am dead, then
bury me in the tomb in which the man of God is buried. Lay my bones beside
his bones. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,32);</script>For the
saying which he cried by the word of Yahweh against the altar in Bethel,
and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of
Samaria, will surely happen.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,33);</script>After this thing
Jeroboam didn’t return from his evil way, but again made priests of the
high places from among all the people. Whoever wanted to, he consecrated
him, that there might be priests of the high places. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,34);</script>This thing became sin to the
house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the
surface of the earth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,1);</script>At that time Abijah
the son of Jeroboam fell sick. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,2);</script>Jeroboam said to his wife,
“Please get up and disguise yourself, that you won’t be recognized as
the wife of Jeroboam. Go to Shiloh. Behold, there is Ahijah the prophet,
who spoke concerning me that I should be king over this people. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,3);</script>Take with you ten loaves, and
cakes, and a jar of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what will
become of the child.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,4);</script>Jeroboam’s wife did
so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. Now
Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,5);</script>Yahweh said to Ahijah, “Behold,
the wife of Jeroboam comes to inquire of you concerning her son; for he is
sick. Thus and thus you shall tell her; for it will be, when she comes in,
that she will pretend to be another woman.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,6);</script>It was so, when Ahijah
heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said,
“Come in, you wife of Jeroboam! Why do you pretend to be another? For I
am sent to you with heavy news. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,7);</script>Go, tell Jeroboam, ‘Thus says
Yahweh, the God of Israel: “Because I exalted you from among the people,
and made you prince over my people Israel, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,8);</script>and tore the kingdom away from
the house of David, and gave it you; and yet you have not been as my
servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his
heart, to do that only which was right in my eyes, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,9);</script>but have done evil above all who
were before you, and have gone and made you other gods, and molten images,
to provoke me to anger, and have cast me behind your back: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,10);</script>therefore, behold, I will bring
evil on the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam everyone who
<a href="#N7">urinates on a wall,</a> he who is shut up and he who is left
at large in Israel, and will utterly sweep away the house of Jeroboam, as
a man sweeps away dung, until it is all gone. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,11);</script>He who dies of Jeroboam in the
city shall the dogs eat; and he who dies in the field shall the birds of
the sky eat: for Yahweh has spoken it.”’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,12);</script>Arise therefore, and go to your
house. When your feet enter into the city, the child shall die. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,13);</script>All Israel shall mourn for him,
and bury him; for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in
him there is found some good thing toward Yahweh, the God of Israel, in
the house of Jeroboam. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,14);</script>Moreover Yahweh will raise him
up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam. This is
day! What? Even now. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,15);</script>For
Yahweh will strike Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water; and he will
root up Israel out of this good land which he gave to their fathers, and
will scatter them beyond the River, because they have made their Asherim,
provoking Yahweh to anger. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,16);</script>He will give Israel up because
of the sins of Jeroboam, which he has sinned, and with which he has made
Israel to sin.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,17);</script>Jeroboam’s wife
arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah. As she came to the threshold of
the house, the child died. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,18);</script>All Israel buried him, and
mourned for him, according to the word of Yahweh, which he spoke by his
servant Ahijah the prophet. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,19);</script>The rest of the acts of
Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in
the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,20);</script>The days which Jeroboam reigned
were two and twenty years: and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his
son reigned in his place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,21);</script>Rehoboam the son of Solomon
reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign,
and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Yahweh had
chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there: and his
mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,22);</script>Judah did that which was evil in
the sight of Yahweh, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins
which they committed, above all that their fathers had done. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,23);</script>For they also built them high
places, and pillars, and Asherim, on every high hill, and under every
green tree; <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,24);</script>and there
were also sodomites in the land: they did according to all the
abominations of the nations which Yahweh drove out before the children of
Israel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,25);</script>It happened in
the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up
against Jerusalem; <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,26);</script>and
he took away the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and the treasures of
the king’s house; he even took away all: and he took away all the
shields of gold which Solomon had made. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,27);</script>King Rehoboam made in their
place shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the captains of
the guard, who kept the door of the king’s house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,28);</script>It was so, that as often as the
king went into the house of Yahweh, the guard bore them, and brought them
back into the guard room. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,29);</script>Now the rest of the acts of
Rehoboam, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Judah? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,30);</script>There was war between Rehoboam
and Jeroboam continually. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,31);</script>Rehoboam slept with his fathers,
and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and his mother’s
name was Naamah the Ammonitess. Abijam his son reigned in his place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,1);</script>Now in the eighteenth
year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat began Abijam to reign over Judah.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(15,2);</script>He reigned three years in
Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(15,3);</script>He walked in all the sins
of his father, which he had done before him; and his heart was not perfect
with Yahweh his God, as the heart of David his father. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,4);</script>Nevertheless for David’s sake,
Yahweh his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him,
and to establish Jerusalem; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,5);</script>because David did that which was
right in the eyes of Yahweh, and didn’t turn aside from anything that he
commanded him all the days of his life, except only in the matter of Uriah
the Hittite. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,6);</script>Now there
was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,7);</script>The rest of the acts of Abijam,
and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles
of the kings of Judah? There was war between Abijam and Jeroboam. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,8);</script>Abijam slept with his fathers;
and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his
place. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,9);</script>In the twentieth
year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Asa to reign over Judah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,10);</script>He reigned forty-one years in
Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(15,11);</script>Asa did that which was
right in the eyes of Yahweh, as did David his father. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,12);</script>He put away the sodomites out of
the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,13);</script>Also Maacah his mother he
removed from being queen, because she had made an abominable image for an
Asherah; and Asa cut down her image, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(15,14);</script>But the high places were
not taken away: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect with Yahweh all
his days. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,15);</script>He brought
into the house of Yahweh the things that his father had dedicated, and the
things that himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,16);</script>There was war between Asa and
Baasha king of Israel all their days. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,17);</script>Baasha king of Israel went up
against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not allow anyone to go out
or come in to Asa king of Judah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,18);</script>Then Asa took all the silver and
the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and the
treasures of the king’s house, and delivered them into the hand of his
servants; and king Asa sent them to Ben Hadad, the son of Tabrimmon, the
son of Hezion, king of Syria, who lived at Damascus, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,19);</script>“There is a treaty between me
and you, between my father and your father. Behold, I have sent to you a
present of silver and gold. Go, break your treaty with Baasha king of
Israel, that he may depart from me.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,20);</script>Ben Hadad listened to
king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of
Israel, and struck Ijon, and Dan, and Abel Beth Maacah, and all
Chinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,21);</script>It happened, when Baasha heard
of it, that he left off building Ramah, and lived in Tirzah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,22);</script>Then king Asa made a
proclamation to all Judah; none was exempted: and they carried away the
stones of Ramah, and its timber, with which Baasha had built; and king Asa
built therewith Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,23);</script>Now the rest of all the acts of
Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he
built, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
Judah? But in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,24);</script>Asa slept with his fathers, and
was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; and
Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,25);</script>Nadab the son of Jeroboam began
to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah; and he
reigned over Israel two years. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,26);</script>He did that which was evil in
the sight of Yahweh, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin
with which he made Israel to sin. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,27);</script>Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the
house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha struck him at
Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel
were laying siege to Gibbethon. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,28);</script>Even in the third year of Asa
king of Judah, Baasha killed him, and reigned in his place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,29);</script>It happened that, as soon as he
was king, he struck all the house of Jeroboam: he didn’t leave to
Jeroboam any who breathed, until he had destroyed him; according to the
saying of Yahweh, which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(15,30);</script>for the sins of Jeroboam
which he sinned, and with which he made Israel to sin, because of his
provocation with which he provoked Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(15,31);</script>Now the rest of the acts
of Nadab, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Israel? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,32);</script>There was war between Asa and
Baasha king of Israel all their days. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,33);</script>In the third year of Asa king of
Judah, Baasha the son of Ahijah began to reign over all Israel in Tirzah
for twenty-four years. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,34);</script>He did that which was evil in
the sight of Yahweh, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin
with which he made Israel to sin.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,1);</script>The word of Yahweh
came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,2);</script>“Because I exalted you out of
the dust, and made you prince over my people Israel, and you have walked
in the way of Jeroboam, and have made my people Israel to sin, to provoke
me to anger with their sins; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,3);</script>behold, I will utterly sweep away
Baasha and his house; and I will make your house like the house of
Jeroboam the son of Nebat. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,4);</script>The dogs will eat Baasha’s
descendants who die in the city; and he who dies of his in the field the
birds of the sky will eat.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,5);</script>Now the rest of the
acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, aren’t they written in
the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,6);</script>Baasha slept with his fathers,
and was buried in Tirzah; and Elah his son reigned in his place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,7);</script>Moreover by the prophet Jehu the
son of Hanani came the word of Yahweh against Baasha, and against his
house, both because of all the evil that he did in the sight of Yahweh, to
provoke him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house
of Jeroboam, and because he struck him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,8);</script>In the twenty-sixth
year of Asa king of Judah, Elah the son of Baasha began to reign over
Israel in Tirzah for two years. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,9);</script>His servant Zimri, captain of
half his chariots, conspired against him. Now he was in Tirzah, drinking
himself drunk in the house of Arza, who was over the household in Tirzah:
<script type="text/javascript">cb(16,10);</script>and Zimri went in and
struck him, and killed him, in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of
Judah, and reigned in his place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,11);</script>It happened, when he began to
reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he struck all the house of
Baasha: he didn’t leave him a single one <a href="#N8">who urinates on a
wall,</a> neither of his relatives, nor of his friends. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,12);</script>Thus Zimri destroyed all the
house of Baasha, according to the word of Yahweh, which he spoke against
Baasha by Jehu the prophet, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,13);</script>for all the sins of Baasha, and
the sins of Elah his son, which they sinned, and with which they made
Israel to sin, to provoke Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger with their
vanities. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,14);</script>Now the rest
of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the
book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,15);</script>In the twenty-seventh year of
Asa king of Judah, Zimri reigned seven days in Tirzah. Now the people were
encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,16);</script>The people who were encamped
heard say, Zimri has conspired, and has also struck the king: therefore
all Israel made Omri, the captain of the army, king over Israel that day
in the camp. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,17);</script>Omri went
up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(16,18);</script>It happened, when Zimri
saw that the city was taken, that he went into the castle of the king’s
house, and burnt the king’s house over him with fire, and died, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,19);</script>for his sins which he sinned in
doing that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, in walking in the way of
Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,20);</script>Now the rest of the acts of
Zimri, and his treason that he committed, aren’t they written in the
book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,21);</script>Then were the people of Israel
divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of
Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,22);</script>But the people who followed Omri
prevailed against the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so
Tibni died, and Omri reigned. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,23);</script>In the thirty-first year of Asa
king of Judah, Omri began to reign over Israel for twelve years. He
reigned six years in Tirzah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,24);</script>He bought the hill Samaria of
Shemer for two talents of silver; and he built on the hill, and called the
name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, the owner of
the hill, Samaria. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,25);</script>Omri
did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and dealt wickedly above
all who were before him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,26);</script>For he walked in all the way of
Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sins with which he made Israel to
sin, to provoke Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger with their vanities.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(16,27);</script>Now the rest of the acts
of Omri which he did, and his might that he showed, aren’t they written
in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,28);</script>So Omri slept with his fathers,
and was buried in Samaria; and Ahab his son reigned in his place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,29);</script>In the thirty-eighth year of Asa
king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab
the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,30);</script>Ahab the son of Omri did that
which was evil in the sight of Yahweh above all that were before him.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(16,31);</script>It happened, as if it
had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of
Nebat, that he took as wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the
Sidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshiped him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,32);</script>He reared up an altar for Baal
in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,33);</script>Ahab made the Asherah; and Ahab
did yet more to provoke Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger than all the
kings of Israel who were before him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,34);</script>In his days Hiel the Bethelite
built Jericho: he laid its foundation with the loss of Abiram his
firstborn, and set up its gates with the loss of his youngest son Segub,
according to the word of Yahweh, which he spoke by Joshua the son of Nun.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,1);</script>Elijah the Tishbite,
who was of the foreigners of Gilead, said to Ahab, “As Yahweh, the God
of Israel, lives, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain
these years, but according to my word.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,2);</script>The word of Yahweh came to him,
saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,3);</script>“Go away from
here, turn eastward, and hide yourself by the brook Cherith, that is
before the Jordan. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,4);</script>It
shall be, that you shall drink of the brook. I have commanded the ravens
to feed you there.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,5);</script>So
he went and did according to the word of Yahweh; for he went and lived by
the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,6);</script>The ravens brought him bread and
flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of
the brook. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,7);</script>It happened
after a while, that the brook dried up, because there was no rain in the
land. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,8);</script>The word of Yahweh
came to him, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,9);</script>“Arise, go to Zarephath, which
belongs to Sidon, and stay there. Behold, I have commanded a widow there
to sustain you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,10);</script>So he arose and went
to Zarephath; and when he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow
was there gathering sticks: and he called to her, and said, “Please get
me a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,11);</script>As she was going to
get it, he called to her, and said, “Please bring me a morsel of bread
in your hand.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,12);</script>She said, “As
Yahweh your God lives, I don’t have a cake, but a handful of meal in the
jar, and a little oil in the jar. Behold, I am gathering two sticks, that
I may go in and bake it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,13);</script>Elijah said to her,
“Don’t be afraid. Go and do as you have said; but make me of it a
little cake first, and bring it out to me, and afterward make some for you
and for your son. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,14);</script>For
thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, ‘The jar of meal shall not empty,
neither shall the jar of oil fail, until the day that Yahweh sends rain on
the earth.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,15);</script>She went and did
according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, ate
many days. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,16);</script>The jar of
meal didn’t empty, neither did the jar of oil fail, according to the
word of Yahweh, which he spoke by Elijah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,17);</script>It happened after these things,
that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his
sickness was so severe, that there was no breath left in him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,18);</script>She said to Elijah, “What have
I to do with you, you man of God? You have come to me to bring my sin to
memory, and to kill my son!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,19);</script>He said to her,
“Give me your son.” He took him out of her bosom, and carried him up
into the room where he stayed, and laid him on his own bed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,20);</script>He cried to Yahweh, and said,
“Yahweh my God, have you also brought evil on the widow with whom I
stay, by killing her son?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,21);</script>He stretched himself
on the child three times, and cried to Yahweh, and said, “Yahweh my God,
please let this child’s soul come into him again.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,22);</script>Yahweh listened to
the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he
revived. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,23);</script>Elijah took the
child, and brought him down out of the room into the house, and delivered
him to his mother; and Elijah said, “Behold, your son lives.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,24);</script>The woman said to
Elijah, “Now I know that you are a man of God, and that the word of
Yahweh in your mouth is truth.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,1);</script>It happened after many
days, that the word of Yahweh came to Elijah, in the third year, saying,
“Go, show yourself to Ahab; and I will send rain on the earth.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,2);</script>Elijah went to show
himself to Ahab. The famine was severe in Samaria. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,3);</script>Ahab called Obadiah, who was over
the household. (Now Obadiah feared Yahweh greatly: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,4);</script>for it was so, when Jezebel cut
off the prophets of Yahweh, that Obadiah took one hundred prophets, and
hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.) <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,5);</script>Ahab said to Obadiah, “Go
through the land, to all the springs of water, and to all the brooks.
Perhaps we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive, that we not
lose all the animals.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,6);</script>So they divided the
land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and
Obadiah went another way by himself. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,7);</script>As Obadiah was in the way,
behold, Elijah met him: and he recognized him, and fell on his face, and
said, “Is it you, my lord Elijah?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,8);</script>He answered him, “It
is I. Go, tell your lord, ‘Behold, Elijah is here!’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,9);</script>He said, “Wherein
have I sinned, that you would deliver your servant into the hand of Ahab,
to kill me? <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,10);</script>As Yahweh
your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom, where my lord has not sent
to seek you. When they said, ‘He is not here,’ he took an oath of the
kingdom and nation, that they didn’t find you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,11);</script>Now you say, ‘Go, tell your
lord, “Behold, Elijah is here.”’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,12);</script>It will happen, as soon as I am
gone from you, that the Spirit of Yahweh will carry you I don’t know
where; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he can’t find you, he will
kill me. But I, your servant, have feared Yahweh from my youth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,13);</script>Wasn’t it told my lord what I
did when Jezebel killed the prophets of Yahweh, how I hid one hundred men
of Yahweh’s prophets with fifty to a cave, and fed them with bread and
water? <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,14);</script>Now you say,
‘Go, tell your lord, “Behold, Elijah is here”;’ and he will kill
me.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,15);</script>Elijah said, “As
Yahweh of Armies lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to
him today.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,16);</script>So Obadiah
went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,17);</script>It happened, when Ahab saw
Elijah, that Ahab said to him, “Is that you, you troubler of Israel?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,18);</script>He answered, “I
have not troubled Israel; but you, and your father’s house, in that you
have forsaken the commandments of Yahweh, and you have followed the Baals.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,19);</script>Now therefore send, and
gather to me all Israel to Mount Carmel, and four hundred fifty of the
prophets of Baal, and four hundred of the prophets of the Asherah, who eat
at Jezebel’s table.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,20);</script>So Ahab sent to all
the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together to Mount
Carmel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,21);</script>Elijah came near
to all the people, and said, “How long will you waver between the two
sides? If Yahweh is God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him.”
<p>The people answered him not a word.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,22);</script>Then Elijah said to
the people, “I, even I only, am left a prophet of Yahweh; but Baal’s
prophets are four hundred fifty men. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,23);</script>Let them therefore give us two
bulls; and let them choose one bull for themselves, and cut it in pieces,
and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under; and I will dress the other
bull, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,24);</script>You call on the name of your
god, and I will call on the name of Yahweh. The God who answers by fire,
let him be God.”
<p>All the people answered, “It is well said.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,25);</script>Elijah said to the
prophets of Baal, “Choose one bull for yourselves, and dress it first;
for you are many; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under
it.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,26);</script>They took the bull
which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal
from morning even until noon, saying, Baal, hear us. But there was no
voice, nor any who answered. They leaped about the altar which was made.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,27);</script>It happened at noon,
that Elijah mocked them, and said, “Cry aloud; for he is a god. Either
he is musing, or he has gone aside, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he
sleeps and must be awakened.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,28);</script>They cried aloud, and
cut themselves in their way with knives and lances, until the blood gushed
out on them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,29);</script>It was so,
when midday was past, that they prophesied until the time of the offering
of the offering; but there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any
who regarded.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,30);</script>Elijah said to all
the people, “Come near to me”; and all the people came near to him. He
repaired the altar of Yahweh that was thrown down. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,31);</script>Elijah took twelve stones,
according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the
word of Yahweh came, saying, “Israel shall be your name.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,32);</script>With the stones he built an
altar in the name of Yahweh. He made a trench around the altar, large
enough to contain two measures of seed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,33);</script>He put the wood in order, and
cut the bull in pieces, and laid it on the wood. He said, “Fill four
jars with water, and pour it on the burnt offering, and on the wood.”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,34);</script>He said, “Do it a
second time”; and they did it the second time. He said, “Do it a third
time”; and they did it the third time. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,35);</script>The water ran around the altar;
and he also filled the trench with water.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,36);</script>It happened at the
time of the offering of the offering, that Elijah the prophet came near,
and said, “Yahweh, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, let it
be known this day that you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant,
and that I have done all these things at your word. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,37);</script>Hear me, Yahweh, hear me, that
this people may know that you, Yahweh, are God, and that you have turned
their heart back again.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,38);</script>Then the fire of
Yahweh fell, and consumed the burnt offering, and the wood, and the
stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,39);</script>When all the people saw
it, they fell on their faces. They said, “Yahweh, he is God! Yahweh, he
is God!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,40);</script>Elijah said to them,
“Seize the prophets of Baal! Don’t let one of them escape!”
<p>They seized them. Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and
killed them there. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,41);</script>Elijah said to Ahab, “Get up,
eat and drink; for there is the sound of abundance of rain.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,42);</script>So Ahab went up to
eat and to drink. Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he bowed
himself down on the earth, and put his face between his knees. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,43);</script>He said to his servant, “Go up
now, look toward the sea.”
<p>He went up, and looked, and said, “There is nothing.”
<p>He said, “Go again” seven times.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,44);</script>It happened at the
seventh time, that he said, “Behold, a small cloud, like a man’s hand,
is rising out of the sea.”
<p>He said, “Go up, tell Ahab, ‘Get ready and go down, so that the
rain doesn’t stop you.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,45);</script>It happened in a
little while, that the sky grew black with clouds and wind, and there was
a great rain. Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,46);</script>The hand of Yahweh was on
Elijah; and he tucked his cloak into his belt and ran before Ahab to the
entrance of Jezreel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,1);</script>Ahab told Jezebel all
that Elijah had done, and how he had killed all the prophets with the
sword. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,2);</script>Then Jezebel sent
a messenger to Elijah, saying, “So let the gods do to me, and more also,
if I don’t make your life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about
this time!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,3);</script>When he saw that, he
arose, and went for his life, and came to Beersheba, which belongs to
Judah, and left his servant there. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,4);</script>But he himself went a day’s
journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree:
and he requested for himself that he might die, and said, “It is enough.
Now, O Yahweh, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,5);</script>He lay down and slept
under a juniper tree; and behold, an angel touched him, and said to him,
“Arise and eat!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,6);</script>He looked, and behold,
there was at his head a cake baked on the coals, and a jar of water. He
ate and drank, and lay down again. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,7);</script>The angel of Yahweh came again
the second time, and touched him, and said, “Arise and eat, because the
journey is too great for you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,8);</script>He arose, and ate and
drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights
to Horeb the Mount of God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,9);</script>He came there to a cave, and
lodged there; and behold, the word of Yahweh came to him, and he said to
him, “What are you doing here, Elijah?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,10);</script>He said, “I have
been very jealous for Yahweh, the God of Armies; for the children of
Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and slain
your prophets with the sword. I, even I only, am left; and they seek my
life, to take it away.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,11);</script>He said, “Go out,
and stand on the mountain before Yahweh.”
<p>Behold, Yahweh passed by, and a great and strong wind tore the
mountains, and broke in pieces the rocks before Yahweh; but Yahweh was not
in the wind. After the wind an earthquake; but Yahweh was not in the
earthquake. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,12);</script>After the
earthquake a fire passed; but Yahweh was not in the fire: and after the
fire a still small voice. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,13);</script>It was so, when Elijah heard it,
that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the
entrance of the cave. Behold, a voice came to him, and said, “What are
you doing here, Elijah?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,14);</script>He said, “I have
been very jealous for Yahweh, the God of Armies; for the children of
Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and slain
your prophets with the sword. I, even I only, am left; and they seek my
life, to take it away.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,15);</script>Yahweh said to him,
“Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus. When you arrive,
you shall anoint Hazael to be king over Syria. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,16);</script>You shall anoint Jehu the son of
Nimshi to be king over Israel; and you shall anoint Elisha the son of
Shaphat of Abel Meholah to be prophet in your place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,17);</script>It shall happen, that he who
escapes from the sword of Hazael, Jehu will kill; and he who escapes from
the sword of Jehu, Elisha will kill. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,18);</script>Yet will I leave seven thousand
in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth
which has not kissed him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,19);</script>So he departed there,
and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing, with twelve yoke of
oxen before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed over to him,
and cast his mantle on him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,20);</script>He left the oxen, and ran after
Elijah, and said, “Let me please kiss my father and my mother, and then
I will follow you.”
<p>He said to him, “Go back again; for what have I done to you?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,21);</script>He returned from
following him, and took the yoke of oxen, and killed them, and boiled
their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave to the people, and
they ate. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and served him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,1);</script>Ben Hadad the king of
Syria gathered all his army together; and there were thirty-two kings with
him, and horses and chariots: and he went up and besieged Samaria, and
fought against it. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,2);</script>He
sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel, into the city, and said to him,
“Thus says Ben Hadad, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,3);</script>‘Your silver and your gold is
mine. Your wives also and your children, even the best, are mine.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,4);</script>The king of Israel
answered, “It is according to your saying, my lord, O king. I am yours,
and all that I have.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,5);</script>The messengers came
again, and said, “Ben Hadad says, ‘I sent indeed to you, saying,
“You shall deliver me your silver, and your gold, and your wives, and
your children; <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,6);</script>but I will
send my servants to you tomorrow about this time, and they shall search
your house, and the houses of your servants; and it shall be, that
whatever is pleasant in your eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and
take it away.”’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,7);</script>Then the king of
Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, “Please notice how
this man seeks mischief; for he sent to me for my wives, and for my
children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I didn’t deny him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,8);</script>All the elders and all
the people said to him, “Don’t listen, neither consent.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,9);</script>Therefore he said to
the messengers of Ben Hadad, “Tell my lord the king, ‘All that you
sent for to your servant at the first I will do; but this thing I cannot
do.’”
<p>The messengers departed, and brought him back the message. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,10);</script>Ben Hadad sent to him, and said,
“The gods do so to me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall
suffice for handfuls for all the people who follow me.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,11);</script>The king of Israel
answered, “Tell him, ‘Don’t let him who puts on his armor brag like
he who takes it off.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,12);</script>It happened, when Ben
Hadad heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings, in the
pavilions, that he said to his servants, “Prepare to attack!” They
prepared to attack the city.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,13);</script>Behold, a prophet
came near to Ahab king of Israel, and said, “Thus says Yahweh, ‘Have
you seen all this great multitude? Behold, I will deliver it into your
hand this day; and you shall know that I am Yahweh.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,14);</script>Ahab said, “By
whom?”
<p>He said, “Thus says Yahweh, ‘By the young men of the princes of the
provinces.’”
<p>Then he said, “Who shall begin the battle?”
<p>He answered, “You.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,15);</script>Then he mustered the
young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and
thirty-two. After them, he mustered all the people, even all the children
of Israel, being seven thousand. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,16);</script>They went out at noon. But Ben
Hadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the
thirty-two kings who helped him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,17);</script>The young men of the princes of
the provinces went out first; and Ben Hadad sent out, and they told him,
saying, “Men are coming out from Samaria.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,18);</script>He said, “If they
have come out for peace, take them alive; or if they have come out for
war, take them alive.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,19);</script>So these went out of
the city, the young men of the princes of the provinces, and the army
which followed them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,20);</script>They each killed his man. The
Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them. Ben Hadad the king of Syria escaped
on a horse with horsemen. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,21);</script>The king of Israel went out, and
struck the horses and chariots, and killed the Syrians with a great
slaughter. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,22);</script>The prophet
came near to the king of Israel, and said to him, “Go, strengthen
yourself, and mark, and see what you do; for at the return of the year the
king of Syria will come up against you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,23);</script>The servants of the
king of Syria said to him, “Their god is a god of the hills; therefore
they were stronger than we. But let us fight against them in the plain,
and surely we shall be stronger than they. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,24);</script>Do this thing: take the kings
away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,25);</script>Muster an army, like the army
that you have lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot. We will
fight against them in the plain, and surely we will be stronger than
them.”
<p>He listened to their voice, and did so. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,26);</script>It happened at the return of the
year, that Ben Hadad mustered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight
against Israel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,27);</script>The
children of Israel were mustered, and were provisioned, and went against
them. The children of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks
of young goats; but the Syrians filled the country. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,28);</script>A man of God came near and spoke
to the king of Israel, and said, “Thus says Yahweh, ‘Because the
Syrians have said, “Yahweh is a god of the hills, but he is not a god of
the valleys”; therefore I will deliver all this great multitude into
your hand, and you shall know that I am Yahweh.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,29);</script>They encamped one
over against the other seven days. So it was, that in the seventh day the
battle was joined; and the children of Israel killed one hundred thousand
footmen of the Syrians in one day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,30);</script>But the rest fled to Aphek, into
the city; and the wall fell on twenty-seven thousand men who were left.
Ben Hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner room. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,31);</script>His servants said to him, “See
now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful
kings. Please let us put sackcloth on our bodies, and ropes on our heads,
and go out to the king of Israel. Maybe he will save your life.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,32);</script>So they put sackcloth
on their bodies and ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel,
and said, “Your servant Ben Hadad says, ‘Please let me live.’”
<p>He said, “Is he still alive? He is my brother.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,33);</script>Now the men observed
diligently, and hurried to take this phrase; and they said, “Your
brother Ben Hadad.”
<p>Then he said, “Go, bring him.”
<p>Then Ben Hadad came out to him; and he caused him to come up into the
chariot. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,34);</script>Ben Hadad said
to him, “The cities which my father took from your father I will
restore. You shall make streets for yourself in Damascus, as my father
made in Samaria.”
<p>“I,” said Ahab, “will let you go with this covenant.” So he
made a covenant with him, and let him go.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,35);</script>A certain man of the
sons of the prophets said to his fellow by the word of Yahweh, “Please
strike me!”
<p>The man refused to strike him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,36);</script>Then he said to him, “Because
you have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh, behold, as soon as you are
departed from me, a lion shall kill you.” As soon as he was departed
from him, a lion found him, and killed him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,37);</script>Then he found another
man, and said, “Please strike me.”
<p>The man struck him, smiting and wounding him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,38);</script>So the prophet departed, and
waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with his headband
over his eyes. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,39);</script>As the
king passed by, he cried to the king; and he said, “Your servant went
out into the midst of the battle; and behold, a man turned aside, and
brought a man to me, and said, ‘Guard this man! If by any means he be
missing, then your life shall be for his life, or else you shall pay a
talent of silver.’ <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,40);</script>As
your servant was busy here and there, he was gone.”
<p>The king of Israel said to him, “So your judgment shall be; you
yourself have decided it.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,41);</script>He hurried, and took
the headband away from his eyes; and the king of Israel recognized that he
was of the prophets. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,42);</script>He
said to him, “Thus says Yahweh, ‘Because you have let go out of your
hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction, therefore your life shall
go for his life, and your people for his people.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,43);</script>The king of Israel
went to his house sullen and angry, and came to Samaria.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,1);</script>It happened after
these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in
Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,2);</script>Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying,
“Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs,
because it is near to my house; and I will give you for it a better
vineyard than it. Or, if it seems good to you, I will give you its worth
in money.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,3);</script>Naboth said to Ahab,
“May Yahweh forbid me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers
to you!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,4);</script>Ahab came into his
house sullen and angry because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had
spoken to him; for he had said, “I will not give you the inheritance of
my fathers.” He laid himself down on his bed, and turned away his face,
and would eat no bread. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,5);</script>But Jezebel his wife came to him,
and said to him, “Why is your spirit so sad, that you eat no bread?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,6);</script>He said to her,
“Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite, and said to him, ‘Give me
your vineyard for money; or else, if it pleases you, I will give you
another vineyard for it.’ He answered, ‘I will not give you my
vineyard.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,7);</script>Jezebel his wife said
to him, “Do you now govern the kingdom of Israel? Arise, and eat bread,
and let your heart be merry. I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the
Jezreelite.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,8);</script>So she
wrote letters in Ahab’s name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent
the letters to the elders and to the nobles who were in his city, who
lived with Naboth. <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,9);</script>She
wrote in the letters, saying, “Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high
among the people. <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,10);</script>Set
two men, base fellows, before him, and let them testify against him,
saying, ‘You cursed God and the king!’ Then carry him out, and stone
him to death.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,11);</script>The men of his city,
even the elders and the nobles who lived in his city, did as Jezebel had
sent to them, according as it was written in the letters which she had
sent to them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,12);</script>They
proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,13);</script>The two men, the base fellows,
came in and sat before him. The base fellows testified against him, even
against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, “Naboth cursed
God and the king!” Then they carried him out of the city, and stoned him
to death with stones. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,14);</script>Then they sent to Jezebel,
saying, “Naboth has been stoned, and is dead.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,15);</script>It happened, when
Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to
Ahab, “Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite,
which he refused to give you for money; for Naboth is not alive, but
dead.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,16);</script>It happened, when
Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the
vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,17);</script>The word of Yahweh came to
Elijah the Tishbite, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,18);</script>“Arise, go down to meet Ahab
king of Israel, who dwells in Samaria. Behold, he is in the vineyard of
Naboth, where he has gone down to take possession of it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,19);</script>You shall speak to him, saying,
‘Thus says Yahweh, “Have you killed and also taken possession?”’
You shall speak to him, saying, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “In the place where
dogs licked the blood of Naboth, dogs will lick your blood, even
yours.”’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,20);</script>Ahab said to Elijah,
“Have you found me, my enemy?”
<p>He answered, “I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do
that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,21);</script>Behold, I will bring evil on
you, and will utterly sweep you away and will cut off from Ahab everyone
<a href="#N9">who urinates against a wall,</a> and him who is shut up and
him who is left at large in Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,22);</script>I will make your house like the
house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son
of Ahijah for the provocation with which you have provoked me to anger,
and have made Israel to sin.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,23);</script>Yahweh also spoke of Jezebel,
saying, “The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the rampart of Jezreel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,24);</script>The dogs will eat he who dies of
Ahab in the city; and the birds of the sky will eat he who dies in the
field.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,25);</script>But there was none
like Ahab, who sold himself to do that which was evil in the sight of
Yahweh, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,26);</script>He did very abominably in
following idols, according to all that the Amorites did, whom Yahweh cast
out before the children of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,27);</script>It happened, when Ahab heard
those words, that he tore his clothes, and put sackcloth on his flesh, and
fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,28);</script>The word of Yahweh
came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,29);</script>“See how Ahab humbles himself
before me? Because he humbles himself before me, I will not bring the evil
in his days; but in his son’s days will I bring the evil on his house.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,1);</script>They continued three
years without war between Syria and Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,2);</script>It happened in the third year,
that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(22,3);</script>The king of Israel said
to his servants, “You know that Ramoth Gilead is ours, and we are still,
and don’t take it out of the hand of the king of Syria?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,4);</script>He said to Jehoshaphat, “Will
you go with me to battle to Ramoth Gilead?”
<p>Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “I am as you are, my people
as your people, my horses as your horses.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,5);</script>Jehoshaphat said to the king of
Israel, “Please inquire first for the word of Yahweh.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,6);</script>Then the king of
Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to
them, “Shall I go against Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?”
<p>They said, “Go up; for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the
king.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,7);</script>But Jehoshaphat said,
“Isn’t there here a prophet of Yahweh, that we may inquire of him?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,8);</script>The king of Israel
said to Jehoshaphat, “There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of
Yahweh, Micaiah the son of Imlah; but I hate him; for he does not prophesy
good concerning me, but evil.”
<p>Jehoshaphat said, “Don’t let the king say so.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,9);</script>Then the king of
Israel called an officer, and said, “Quickly get Micaiah the son of
Imlah.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,10);</script>Now the king of
Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting each on his throne,
arrayed in their robes, in an open place at the entrance of the gate of
Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,11);</script>Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah
made him horns of iron, and said, “Thus says Yahweh, ‘With these you
shall push the Syrians, until they are consumed.’” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,12);</script>All the prophets prophesied so,
saying, “Go up to Ramoth Gilead, and prosper; for Yahweh will deliver it
into the hand of the king.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,13);</script>The messenger who
went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, “See now, the prophets
declare good to the king with one mouth. Please let your word be like the
word of one of them, and speak good.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,14);</script>Micaiah said, “As
Yahweh lives, what Yahweh says to me, that I will speak.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,15);</script>When he had come to
the king, the king said to him, “Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth Gilead
to battle, or shall we forbear?”
<p>He answered him, “Go up and prosper; and Yahweh will deliver it into
the hand of the king.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,16);</script>The king said to him, “How
many times do I have to adjure you that you speak to me nothing but the
truth in the name of Yahweh?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,17);</script>He said, “I saw all
Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. Yahweh
said, ‘These have no master. Let them each return to his house in
peace.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,18);</script>The king of Israel
said to Jehoshaphat, “Didn’t I tell you that he would not prophesy
good concerning me, but evil?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,19);</script>Micaiah said,
“Therefore hear the word of Yahweh. I saw Yahweh sitting on his throne,
and all the army of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his
left. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,20);</script>Yahweh said,
‘Who shall entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth Gilead?’
One said one thing; and another said another. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,21);</script>A spirit came out and stood
before Yahweh, and said, ‘I will entice him.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,22);</script>Yahweh said to him, ‘How?’
He said, ‘I will go out and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all
his prophets.’ He said, ‘You will entice him, and will also prevail.
Go out and do so.’ <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,23);</script>Now
therefore, behold, Yahweh has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these
your prophets; and Yahweh has spoken evil concerning you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,24);</script>Then Zedekiah the son
of Chenaanah came near, and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said,
“Which way did the Spirit of Yahweh go from me to speak to you?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,25);</script>Micaiah said,
“Behold, you will see on that day, when you go into an inner room to
hide yourself.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,26);</script>The king of Israel
said, “Take Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the
city, and to Joash the king’s son. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,27);</script>Say, ‘Thus says the king,
“Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction
and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.”’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,28);</script>Micaiah said, “If
you return at all in peace, Yahweh has not spoken by me.” He said,
“Listen, all you people!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,29);</script>So the king of Israel
and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,30);</script>The king of Israel said to
Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but you
put on your robes.” The king of Israel disguised himself, and went into
the battle.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,31);</script>Now the king of Syria
had commanded the thirty-two captains of his chariots, saying, Fight
neither with small nor great, except only with the king of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,32);</script>It happened, when the captains
of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, “Surely that is the
king of Israel!” and they turned aside to fight against him. Jehoshaphat
cried out. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,33);</script>It happened,
when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel,
that they turned back from pursuing him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,34);</script>A certain man drew his bow at
random, and struck the king of Israel between the joints of the armor.
Therefore he said to the driver of his chariot, “Turn your hand, and
carry me out of the battle; for I am severely wounded.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,35);</script>The battle increased that day.
The king was propped up in his chariot facing the Syrians, and died at
evening. The blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(22,36);</script>A cry went throughout
the army about the going down of the sun, saying, “Every man to his
city, and every man to his country!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,37);</script>So the king died, and
was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,38);</script>They washed the chariot by the
pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood where the prostitutes
washed themselves; according to the word of Yahweh which he spoke.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,39);</script>Now the rest of the
acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built, and
all the cities that he built, aren’t they written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Israel? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,40);</script>So Ahab slept with his fathers;
and Ahaziah his son reigned in his place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,41);</script>Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began
to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,42);</script>Jehoshaphat was thirty-five
years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty-five years in
Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,43);</script>He walked in all the way of Asa
his father; He didn’t turn aside from it, doing that which was right in
the eyes of Yahweh: however the high places were not taken away; the
people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,44);</script>Jehoshaphat made peace with the
king of Israel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,45);</script>Now the
rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he
warred, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
of Judah? <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,46);</script>The remnant of
the sodomites, that remained in the days of his father Asa, he put away
out of the land. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,47);</script>There
was no king in Edom: a deputy was king. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,48);</script>Jehoshaphat made ships of
Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they didn’t go; for the ships were
broken at Ezion Geber. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,49);</script>Then Ahaziah the son of Ahab
said to Jehoshaphat, “Let my servants go with your servants in the
ships.” But Jehoshaphat would not. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,50);</script>Jehoshaphat slept with his
fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father;
Jehoram his son reigned in his place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,51);</script>Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to
reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king
of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,52);</script>He did that which was evil in
the sight of Yahweh, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way
of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, in which he
made Israel to sin. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,53);</script>He
served Baal, and worshiped him, and provoked to anger Yahweh, the God of
Israel, according to all that his father had done.
