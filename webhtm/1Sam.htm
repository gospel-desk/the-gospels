<h1>
The First Book of Samuel
</h1><p>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,1);</script>Now there was a certain
man of Ramathaim Zophim, of the hill country of Ephraim, and his name was
Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of
Zuph, an Ephraimite: <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,2);</script>and
he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of other
Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,3);</script>This man went up out of his city
from year to year to worship and to sacrifice to <a href="#N1">Yahweh</a>
of Armies in Shiloh. The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests to
Yahweh, were there. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,4);</script>When
the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to
all her sons and her daughters, portions: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,5);</script>but to Hannah he gave a double
portion; for he loved Hannah, but Yahweh had shut up her womb. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,6);</script>Her rival provoked her severely,
to make her fret, because Yahweh had shut up her womb. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,7);</script>As he did so year by year, when
she went up to the house of Yahweh, so she provoked her; therefore she
wept, and didn’t eat. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,8);</script>Elkanah her husband said to her,
“Hannah, why do you weep? Why don’t you eat? Why is your heart
grieved? Am I not better to you than ten sons?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,9);</script>So Hannah rose up after
they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest was
sitting on his seat by the doorpost of Yahweh’s temple. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,10);</script>She was in bitterness of soul,
and prayed to Yahweh, and wept bitterly. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,11);</script>She vowed a vow, and said,
“Yahweh of Armies, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your
handmaid, and remember me, and not forget your handmaid, but will give to
your handmaid a boy, then I will give him to Yahweh all the days of his
life, and no razor shall come on his head.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,12);</script>It happened, as she
continued praying before Yahweh, that Eli saw her mouth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,13);</script>Now Hannah spoke in her heart.
Only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli thought
she had been drunken. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,14);</script>Eli
said to her, “How long will you be drunken? Put away your wine from
you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,15);</script>Hannah answered,
“No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit. I have drunk neither
wine nor strong drink, but I poured out my soul before Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,16);</script>Don’t count your handmaid for a
wicked woman; for I have been speaking out of the abundance of my
complaint and my provocation.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,17);</script>Then Eli answered,
“Go in peace; and may the <a href="#N2">God</a> of Israel grant your
petition that you have asked of him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,18);</script>She said, “Let your
handmaid find favor in your sight.” So the woman went her way, and ate;
and her facial expression wasn’t sad any more. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,19);</script>They rose up in the morning
early, and worshiped before Yahweh, and returned, and came to their house
to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and Yahweh remembered her.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,20);</script>It happened, when the
time had come, that Hannah conceived, and bore a son; and she named him <a
href="#N3">Samuel,</a> saying, “Because I have asked him of Yahweh.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,21);</script>The man Elkanah, and
all his house, went up to offer to Yahweh the yearly sacrifice, and his
vow. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,22);</script>But Hannah didn’t
go up; for she said to her husband, “Not until the child is weaned; then
I will bring him, that he may appear before Yahweh, and stay there
forever.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,23);</script>Elkanah her husband
said to her, “Do what seems good to you. Wait until you have weaned him;
only may Yahweh establish his word.”
<p>So the woman waited and nursed her son, until she weaned him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,24);</script>When she had weaned him, she took
him up with her, with three bulls, and one <a href="#N4">ephah</a> of
meal, and a bottle of wine, and brought him to Yahweh’s house in Shiloh.
The child was young. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,25);</script>They
killed the bull, and brought the child to Eli. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,26);</script>She said, “Oh, my lord, as your
soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood by you here, praying to
Yahweh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,27);</script>For this child I
prayed; and Yahweh has given me my petition which I asked of him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,28);</script>Therefore also I have granted him
to Yahweh. As long as he lives he is granted to Yahweh.” He worshiped
Yahweh there.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,1);</script>Hannah prayed, and said:
<dl>
<dt>“My heart exults in Yahweh!
<dd>My horn is exalted in Yahweh.
<dt>My mouth is enlarged over my enemies,
<dd>because I rejoice in your salvation.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,2);</script>There is no one as
holy as Yahweh,
<dd>For there is no one besides you,
<dd>nor is there any rock like our God.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,3);</script>“Talk no more so
exceeding proudly.
<dd>Don’t let arrogance come out of your mouth,
<dd>For Yahweh is a God of knowledge.
<dd>By him actions are weighed.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,4);</script>“The bows of the
mighty men are broken.
<dd>Those who stumbled are armed with strength.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,5);</script>Those who were full
have hired themselves out for bread.
<dd>Those who were hungry are satisfied.
<dt>Yes, the barren has borne seven.
<dd>She who has many children languishes.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,6);</script>“Yahweh kills, and
makes alive.
<dd>He brings down to <a href="#N5">Sheol</a>, and brings up.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,7);</script>Yahweh makes poor, and
makes rich.
<dd>He brings low, he also lifts up.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,8);</script>He raises up the poor
out of the dust.
<dd>He lifts up the needy from the dunghill,
<dd>To make them sit with princes,
<dd>and inherit the throne of glory.
<dt>For the pillars of the earth are Yahweh’s.
<dd>He has set the world on them.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,9);</script>He will keep the feet
of his holy ones,
<dd>but the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness;
<dd>for no man shall prevail by strength.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,10);</script>Those who strive with
Yahweh shall be broken to pieces.
<dd>He will thunder against them in the sky.
<dt>
<dt>“Yahweh will judge the ends of the earth.
<dd>He will give strength to his king,
<dd>and exalt the horn of his anointed.”
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,11);</script>Elkanah went to Ramah
to his house. The child served Yahweh before Eli the priest. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,12);</script>Now the sons of Eli were base
men; they didn’t know Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,13);</script>The custom of the priests with
the people was that when any man offered sacrifice, the priest’s servant
came, while the flesh was boiling, with a fork of three teeth in his hand;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,14);</script>and he struck it into the
pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fork brought up the
priest took therewith. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who
came there. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,15);</script>Yes, before
they burnt the fat, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man who
sacrificed, “Give meat to roast for the priest; for he will not accept
boiled meat from you, but raw.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,16);</script>If the man said to
him, “Let the fat be burned first, and then take as much as your soul
desires”; then he would say, “No, but you shall give it to me now; and
if not, I will take it by force.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,17);</script>The sin of the young men was very
great before Yahweh; for the men despised the offering of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,18);</script>But Samuel ministered before
Yahweh, being a child, clothed with a linen ephod. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,19);</script>Moreover his mother made him a
little robe, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up
with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,20);</script>Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife,
and said, “Yahweh give you seed of this woman for the petition which was
asked of Yahweh.” They went to their own home. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,21);</script>Yahweh visited Hannah, and she
conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. The child Samuel grew
before Yahweh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,22);</script>Now Eli
was very old; and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel, and how
that they lay with the women who served at the door of the Tent of
Meeting. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,23);</script>He said to them,
“Why do you do such things? for I hear of your evil dealings from all
this people. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,24);</script>No, my sons;
for it is no good report that I hear: you make Yahweh’s people disobey.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,25);</script>If one man sin against
another, God shall judge him; but if a man sin against Yahweh, who shall
entreat for him?” Notwithstanding, they didn’t listen to the voice of
their father, because Yahweh intended to kill them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,26);</script>The child Samuel grew on, and
increased in favor both with Yahweh, and also with men. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,27);</script>A man of God came to Eli, and
said to him, “Thus says Yahweh, ‘Did I reveal myself to the house of
your father, when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaoh’s house?
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,28);</script>Did I choose him out of
all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn
incense, to wear an ephod before me? Did I give to the house of your
father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,29);</script>Why do you kick at my sacrifice
and at my offering, which I have commanded in my habitation, and honor
your sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the best of all the
offerings of Israel my people?’
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,30);</script>“Therefore Yahweh,
the God of Israel, says, ‘I said indeed that your house, and the house
of your father, should walk before me forever.’ But now Yahweh says,
‘Be it far from me; for those who honor me I will honor, and those who
despise me shall be lightly esteemed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,31);</script>Behold, the days come, that I
will cut off your arm, and the arm of your father’s house, that there
shall not be an old man in your house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,32);</script>You shall see the affliction of
my habitation, in all the wealth which I shall give Israel; and there
shall not be an old man in your house forever. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,33);</script>The man of yours, whom I shall
not cut off from my altar, shall consume your eyes, and grieve your heart;
and all the increase of your house shall die in the flower of their age.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,34);</script>“‘This shall be
the sign to you, that shall come on your two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas:
in one day they shall both die. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,35);</script>I will raise me up a faithful
priest, that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my
mind. I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before my anointed
forever. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,36);</script>It shall happen,
that everyone who is left in your house shall come and bow down to him for
a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and shall say, “Please put me
into one of the priests’ offices, that I may eat a morsel of
bread.”’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,1);</script>The child Samuel
ministered to Yahweh before Eli. The word of Yahweh was precious in those
days; there was no frequent vision. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,2);</script>It happened at that time, when Eli
was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to grow dim, so that he
could not see), <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,3);</script>and the
lamp of God hadn’t yet gone out, and Samuel had laid down in Yahweh’s
temple, where the ark of God was; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,4);</script>that Yahweh called Samuel; and he
said, “Here I am.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,5);</script>He
ran to Eli, and said, “Here I am; for you called me.”
<p>He said, “I didn’t call; lie down again.”
<p>He went and lay down. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,6);</script>Yahweh called yet again,
“Samuel!”
<p>Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, “Here I am; for you called
me.”
<p>He answered, “I didn’t call, my son; lie down again.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,7);</script>Now Samuel didn’t yet know
Yahweh, neither was the word of Yahweh yet revealed to him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,8);</script>Yahweh called Samuel again the
third time. He arose and went to Eli, and said, “Here I am; for you
called me.”
<p>Eli perceived that Yahweh had called the child. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,9);</script>Therefore Eli said to Samuel,
“Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he calls you, that you shall say,
‘Speak, Yahweh; for your servant hears.’” So Samuel went and lay
down in his place. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,10);</script>Yahweh
came, and stood, and called as at other times, “Samuel! Samuel!”
<p>Then Samuel said, “Speak; for your servant hears.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,11);</script>Yahweh said to Samuel,
“Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of everyone
who hears it shall tingle. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,12);</script>In that day I will perform
against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the
beginning even to the end. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,13);</script>For I have told him that I will
judge his house forever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons
brought a curse on themselves, and he didn’t restrain them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,14);</script>Therefore I have sworn to the
house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be removed with
sacrifice nor offering forever.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,15);</script>Samuel lay until the
morning, and opened the doors of the house of Yahweh. Samuel feared to
show Eli the vision. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,16);</script>Then
Eli called Samuel, and said, “Samuel, my son!”
<p>He said, “Here I am.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,17);</script>He said, “What is
the thing that he has spoken to you? Please don’t hide it from me. God
do so to you, and more also, if you hide anything from me of all the
things that he spoke to you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,18);</script>Samuel told him every
bit, and hid nothing from him.
<p>He said, “It is Yahweh. Let him do what seems good to him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,19);</script>Samuel grew, and
Yahweh was with him, and let none of his words fall to the ground. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,20);</script>All Israel from Dan even to
Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of Yahweh.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,21);</script>Yahweh appeared again in
Shiloh; for Yahweh revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of
Yahweh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,1);</script>The word of Samuel came
to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and
encamped beside Ebenezer: and the Philistines encamped in Aphek. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,2);</script>The Philistines put themselves in
array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was struck
before the Philistines; and they killed of the army in the field about
four thousand men. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,3);</script>When
the people had come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, “Why has
Yahweh struck us today before the Philistines? Let us get the ark of the
covenant of Yahweh out of Shiloh to us, that it may come among us, and
save us out of the hand of our enemies.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,4);</script>So the people sent to
Shiloh; and they brought from there the ark of the covenant of Yahweh of
Armies, who sits above the cherubim: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and
Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,5);</script>When the ark of the covenant of
Yahweh came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that
the earth rang again. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,6);</script>When
the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, “What does the
noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews mean?” They
understood that the ark of Yahweh had come into the camp. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,7);</script>The Philistines were afraid, for
they said, “God has come into the camp.” They said, “Woe to us! For
there has not been such a thing before. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,8);</script>Woe to us! Who shall deliver us
out of the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods that struck the
Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,9);</script>Be strong, and behave like men, O
you Philistines, that you not be servants to the Hebrews, as they have
been to you. Strengthen yourselves like men, and fight!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,10);</script>The Philistines fought, and
Israel was struck, and they fled every man to his tent: and there was a
very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,11);</script>The ark of God was taken;
and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,12);</script>There ran a man of Benjamin out
of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes torn, and
with earth on his head. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,13);</script>When he came, behold, Eli was
sitting on his seat by the road watching; for his heart trembled for the
ark of God. When the man came into the city, and told it, all the city
cried out. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,14);</script>When Eli heard
the noise of the crying, he said, “What does the noise of this tumult
mean?”
<p>The man hurried, and came and told Eli. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,15);</script>Now Eli was ninety-eight years
old; and his eyes were set, so that he could not see. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,16);</script>The man said to Eli, “I am he
who came out of the army, and I fled today out of the army.”
<p>He said, “How did the matter go, my son?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,17);</script>He who brought the
news answered, “Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has
been also a great slaughter among the people. Your two sons also, Hophni
and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,18);</script>It happened, when he
made mention of the ark of God, that Eli fell from off his seat backward
by the side of the gate; and his neck broke, and he died; for he was an
old man, and heavy. He had judged Israel forty years.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,19);</script>His daughter-in-law,
Phinehas’ wife, was with child, near to be delivered. When she heard the
news that the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her
husband were dead, she bowed herself and gave birth; for her pains came on
her. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,20);</script>About the time of
her death the women who stood by her said to her, “Don’t be afraid;
for you have given birth to a son.” But she didn’t answer, neither did
she regard it. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,21);</script>She named
the child <a href="#N6">Ichabod,</a> saying, “The glory has departed
from Israel”; because the ark of God was taken, and because of her
father-in-law and her husband. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,22);</script>She said, “The glory has
departed from Israel; for the ark of God is taken.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,1);</script>Now the Philistines had
taken the ark of God, and they brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,2);</script>The Philistines took the ark of
God, and brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,3);</script>When they of Ashdod arose early on
the next day, behold, Dagon was fallen on his face to the ground before
the ark of Yahweh. They took Dagon, and set him in his place again.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(5,4);</script>When they arose early on
the next day morning, behold, Dagon was fallen on his face to the ground
before the ark of Yahweh; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his
hands were cut off on the threshold. Only Dagon’s torso was intact.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(5,5);</script>Therefore neither the
priests of Dagon, nor any who come into Dagon’s house, tread on the
threshold of Dagon in Ashdod, to this day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,6);</script>But the hand of Yahweh was heavy
on them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and struck them with tumors,
even Ashdod and its borders.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,7);</script>When the men of Ashdod
saw that it was so, they said, “The ark of the God of Israel shall not
stay with us; for his hand is severe on us, and on Dagon our god.”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(5,8);</script>They sent therefore and
gathered all the lords of the Philistines to them, and said, “What shall
we do with the ark of the God of Israel?”
<p>They answered, “Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried over to
Gath.” They carried the ark of the God of Israel there. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,9);</script>It was so, that after they had
carried it about, the hand of Yahweh was against the city with a very
great confusion: and he struck the men of the city, both small and great;
and tumors broke out on them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,10);</script>So they sent the ark of God to
Ekron.
<p>It happened, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried
out, saying, “They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to
us, to kill us and our people.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,11);</script>They sent therefore and gathered
together all the lords of the Philistines, and they said, “Send away the
ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to its own place, that it
not kill us and our people.” For there was a deadly confusion throughout
all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,12);</script>The men who didn’t die were
struck with the tumors; and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,1);</script>The ark of Yahweh was
in the country of the Philistines seven months. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,2);</script>The Philistines called for the
priests and the diviners, saying, “What shall we do with the ark of
Yahweh? Show us with which we shall send it to its place.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,3);</script>They said, “If you
send away the ark of the God of Israel, don’t send it empty; but by all
means return him a trespass offering: then you shall be healed, and it
shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,4);</script>Then they said, “What
shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him?”
<p>They said, “Five golden tumors, and five golden mice, for the number
of the lords of the Philistines; for one plague was on you all, and on
your lords. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,5);</script>Therefore you
shall make images of your tumors, and images of your mice that mar the
land; and you shall give glory to the God of Israel: perhaps he will
lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your
land. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,6);</script>Why then do you
harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts?
When he had worked wonderfully among them, didn’t they let the people
go, and they departed?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,7);</script>“Now therefore take
and prepare yourselves a new cart, and two milk cows, on which there has
come no yoke; and tie the cows to the cart, and bring their calves home
from them; <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,8);</script>and take the
ark of Yahweh, and lay it on the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which
you return him for a trespass offering, in a coffer by its side; and send
it away, that it may go. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,9);</script>Behold; if it goes up by the way
of its own border to Beth Shemesh, then he has done us this great evil:
but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that struck us; it
was a chance that happened to us.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,10);</script>The men did so, and
took two milk cows, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at
home; <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,11);</script>and they put the
ark of Yahweh on the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the
images of their tumors. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,12);</script>The cows took the straight way by
the way to Beth Shemesh; they went along the highway, lowing as they went,
and didn’t turn aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of
the Philistines went after them to the border of Beth Shemesh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,13);</script>They of Beth Shemesh were reaping
their wheat harvest in the valley; and they lifted up their eyes, and saw
the ark, and rejoiced to see it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,14);</script>The cart came into the field of
Joshua of Beth Shemesh, and stood there, where there was a great stone:
and they split the wood of the cart, and offered up the cows for a burnt
offering to Yahweh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,15);</script>The
Levites took down the ark of Yahweh, and the coffer that was with it, in
which the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone: and the
men of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the
same day to Yahweh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,16);</script>When
the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the
same day. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,17);</script>These are the
golden tumors which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering to
Yahweh: for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Ashkelon one, for Gath one, for
Ekron one; <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,18);</script>and the golden
mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines
belonging to the five lords, both of fortified cities and of country
villages, even to the great stone, whereon they set down the ark of
Yahweh. That stone remains to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth
Shemesh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,19);</script>He struck of the
men of Beth Shemesh, because they had looked into the ark of Yahweh, he
struck of the people fifty thousand seventy men; and the people mourned,
because Yahweh had struck the people with a great slaughter. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,20);</script>The men of Beth Shemesh said,
“Who is able to stand before Yahweh, this holy God? To whom shall he go
up from us?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,21);</script>They sent messengers
to the inhabitants of Kiriath Jearim, saying, “The Philistines have
brought back the ark of Yahweh; come down, and bring it up to
yourselves.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,1);</script>The men of Kiriath
Jearim came, and fetched up the ark of Yahweh, and brought it into the
house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the
ark of Yahweh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,2);</script>It
happened, from the day that the ark stayed in Kiriath Jearim, that the
time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel
lamented after Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,3);</script>Samuel spoke to all the house of
Israel, saying, “If you do return to Yahweh with all your heart, then
put away the foreign gods and the Ashtaroth from among you, and direct
your hearts to Yahweh, and serve him only; and he will deliver you out of
the hand of the Philistines.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,4);</script>Then the children of Israel
removed the Baals and the Ashtaroth, and served Yahweh only. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,5);</script>Samuel said, “Gather all Israel
to Mizpah, and I will pray for you to Yahweh.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,6);</script>They gathered together to Mizpah,
and drew water, and poured it out before Yahweh, and fasted on that day,
and said there, “We have sinned against Yahweh.” Samuel judged the
children of Israel in Mizpah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,7);</script>When the Philistines heard that
the children of Israel were gathered together at Mizpah, the lords of the
Philistines went up against Israel. When the children of Israel heard it,
they were afraid of the Philistines. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,8);</script>The children of Israel said to
Samuel, “Don’t cease to cry to Yahweh our God for us, that he will
save us out of the hand of the Philistines.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,9);</script>Samuel took a suckling lamb, and
offered it for a whole burnt offering to Yahweh: and Samuel cried to
Yahweh for Israel; and Yahweh answered him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,10);</script>As Samuel was offering up the
burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel; but
Yahweh thundered with a great thunder on that day on the Philistines, and
confused them; and they were struck down before Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,11);</script>The men of Israel went out of
Mizpah, and pursued the Philistines, and struck them, until they came
under Beth Kar.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,12);</script>Then Samuel took a
stone, and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and called its name <a
href="#N7">Ebenezer,</a> saying, “Yahweh helped us until now.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,13);</script>So the Philistines were subdued,
and they came no more within the border of Israel. The hand of Yahweh was
against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,14);</script>The cities which the
Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even
to Gath; and Israel recovered its border out of the hand of the
Philistines. There was peace between Israel and the Amorites. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,15);</script>Samuel judged Israel all the days
of his life. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,16);</script>He went from
year to year in circuit to Bethel and Gilgal, and Mizpah; and he judged
Israel in all those places. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,17);</script>His return was to Ramah, for
there was his house; and there he judged Israel: and he built there an
altar to Yahweh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,1);</script>It happened, when
Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,2);</script>Now the name of his firstborn was
Joel; and the name of his second, Abijah: they were judges in Beersheba.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,3);</script>His sons didn’t walk in
his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted
justice. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,4);</script>Then all the
elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel to
Ramah; <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,5);</script>and they said to
him, “Behold, you are old, and your sons don’t walk in your ways: now
make us a king to judge us like all the nations.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,6);</script>But the thing displeased Samuel,
when they said, “Give us a king to judge us.”
<p>Samuel prayed to Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,7);</script>Yahweh said to Samuel, “Listen
to the voice of the people in all that they tell you; for they have not
rejected you, but they have rejected me, that I should not be king over
them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,8);</script>According to all the
works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of
Egypt even to this day, in that they have forsaken me, and served other
gods, so do they also to you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,9);</script>Now therefore listen to their
voice: however you shall protest solemnly to them, and shall show them the
way of the king who shall reign over them.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,10);</script>Samuel told all the
words of Yahweh to the people who asked of him a king. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,11);</script>He said, “This will be the way
of the king who shall reign over you: he will take your sons, and appoint
them to him, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and they shall run
before his chariots; <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,12);</script>and
he will appoint them to him for captains of thousands, and captains of
fifties; and he will assign some to plow his ground, and to reap his
harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and the instruments of his
chariots. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,13);</script>He will take
your daughters to be perfumers, and to be cooks, and to be bakers. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,14);</script>He will take your fields, and
your vineyards, and your olive groves, even their best, and give them to
his servants. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,15);</script>He will
take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his
officers, and to his servants. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,16);</script>He will take your male servants,
and your female servants, and your best young men, and your donkeys, and
put them to his work. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,17);</script>He
will take the tenth of your flocks: and you shall be his servants. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,18);</script>You shall cry out in that day
because of your king whom you shall have chosen you; and Yahweh will not
answer you in that day.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,19);</script>But the people refused
to listen to the voice of Samuel; and they said, “No; but we will have a
king over us, <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,20);</script>that we
also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us, and go
out before us, and fight our battles.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,21);</script>Samuel heard all the
words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,22);</script>Yahweh said to Samuel, “Listen
to their voice, and make them a king.”
<p>Samuel said to the men of Israel, “Every man go to his city.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,1);</script>Now there was a man of
Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son
of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, the son of a Benjamite, a mighty man of
valor. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,2);</script>He had a son, whose
name was Saul, an impressive young man; and there was not among the
children of Israel a better person than he. From his shoulders and upward
he was higher than any of the people.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,3);</script>The donkeys of Kish,
Saul’s father, were lost. Kish said to Saul his son, “Take now one of
the servants with you, and arise, go seek the donkeys.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,4);</script>He passed through the hill country
of Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they didn’t
find them: then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and there they
weren’t there: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but
they didn’t find them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,5);</script>When they had come to
the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, “Come, and
let us return, lest my father stop caring about the donkeys, and be
anxious for us.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,6);</script>He said to him, “See
now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is a man who is held in
honor. All that he says comes surely to pass. Now let us go there. Perhaps
he can tell us concerning our journey whereon we go.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,7);</script>Then Saul said to his
servant, “But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? For the
bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the
man of God. What do we have?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,8);</script>The servant answered
Saul again, and said, “Behold, I have in my hand the fourth part of a
shekel of silver. I will give that to the man of God, to tell us our
way.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,9);</script>(In earlier times
in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he said, “Come, and
let us go to the seer”; for he who is now called a prophet was before
called a Seer.)
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,10);</script>Then Saul said to his
servant, “Well said. Come, let us go.” So they went to the city where
the man of God was. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,11);</script>As
they went up the ascent to the city, they found young maidens going out to
draw water, and said to them, “Is the seer here?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,12);</script>They answered them,
and said, “He is. Behold, he is before you. Hurry now, for he has come
today into the city; for the people have a sacrifice today in the high
place. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,13);</script>As soon as you
have come into the city, you shall immediately find him, before he goes up
to the high place to eat; for the people will not eat until he come,
because he blesses the sacrifice. Afterwards those who are invited eat.
Now therefore go up; for at this time you shall find him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,14);</script>They went up to the
city. As they came within the city, behold, Samuel came out toward them,
to go up to the high place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,15);</script>Now Yahweh had
revealed to Samuel a day before Saul came, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,16);</script>“Tomorrow about this time I
will send you a man out of the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him
to be prince over my people Israel; and he shall save my people out of the
hand of the Philistines: for I have looked on my people, because their cry
has come to me.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,17);</script>When Samuel saw Saul,
Yahweh said to him, “Behold, the man of whom I spoke to you! this same
shall have authority over my people.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,18);</script>Then Saul drew near to
Samuel in the gate, and said, “Please tell me where the seer’s house
is.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,19);</script>Samuel answered Saul,
and said, “I am the seer. Go up before me to the high place, for you
shall eat with me today. In the morning I will let you go, and will tell
you all that is in your heart. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,20);</script>As for your donkeys who were lost
three days ago, don’t set your mind on them; for they are found. For
whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for you, and for all
your father’s house?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,21);</script>Saul answered, “Am I
not a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? And my family
the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then do you
speak to me like this?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,22);</script>Samuel took Saul and
his servant, and brought them into the guest room, and made them sit in
the best place among those who were invited, who were about thirty
persons. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,23);</script>Samuel said to
the cook, “Bring the portion which I gave you, of which I said to you,
‘Set it aside.’” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,24);</script>The cook took up the thigh, and
that which was on it, and set it before Saul. Samuel said, “Behold, that
which has been reserved! Set it before yourself and eat; because for the
appointed time has it been kept for you, for I said, ‘I have invited the
people.’” So Saul ate with Samuel that day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,25);</script>When they had come
down from the high place into the city, he talked with Saul on the
housetop. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,26);</script>They arose
early: and it happened about the spring of the day, that Samuel called to
Saul on the housetop, saying, “Get up, that I may send you away.” Saul
arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,27);</script>As they were going down at the
end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell the servant pass on before
us” (and he passed on), “but stand still first, that I may cause you
to hear the word of God.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,1);</script>Then Samuel took the
vial of oil, and poured it on his head, and kissed him, and said,
“Isn’t it that Yahweh has anointed you to be prince over his
inheritance? <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,2);</script>When you
have departed from me today, then you shall find two men by Rachel’s
tomb, in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will tell you, ‘The
donkeys which you went to seek have been found; and behold, your father
has stopped caring about the donkeys, and is anxious for you, saying,
“What shall I do for my son?”’
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,3);</script>“Then you shall go
on forward from there, and you shall come to the oak of Tabor; and three
men shall meet you there going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three
young goats, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another
carrying a bottle of wine: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,4);</script>and they will greet you, and give
you two loaves of bread, which you shall receive of their hand.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,5);</script>“After that you
shall come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines:
and it shall happen, when you have come there to the city, that you shall
meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery,
and a tambourine, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they will be
prophesying: <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,6);</script>and the
Spirit of Yahweh will come mightily on you, and you shall prophesy with
them, and shall be turned into another man. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,7);</script>Let it be, when these signs have
come to you, that you do as occasion shall serve you; for God is with you.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,8);</script>“You shall go down
before me to Gilgal; and behold, I will come down to you, to offer burnt
offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: you shall wait
seven days, until I come to you, and show you what you shall do.”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(10,9);</script>It was so, that when he
had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all
those signs happened that day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,10);</script>When they came there to the
hill, behold, a band of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came
mightily on him, and he prophesied among them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,11);</script>It happened, when all who knew
him before saw that, behold, he prophesied with the prophets, then the
people said one to another, “What is this that has come to the son of
Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,12);</script>One of the same place
answered, “Who is their father?” Therefore it became a proverb, “Is
Saul also among the prophets?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,13);</script>When he had made an end of
prophesying, he came to the high place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,14);</script>Saul’s uncle said
to him and to his servant, “Where did you go?”
<p>He said, “To seek the donkeys. When we saw that they were not found,
we came to Samuel.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,15);</script>Saul’s uncle said,
“Please tell me what Samuel said to you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,16);</script>Saul said to his
uncle, “He told us plainly that the donkeys were found.” But
concerning the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel spoke, he didn’t
tell him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,17);</script>Samuel called the
people together to Yahweh to Mizpah; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,18);</script>and he said to the children of
Israel, “Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, ‘I brought up Israel out
of Egypt, and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of
the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you:’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,19);</script>but you have this day rejected
your God, who himself saves you out of all your calamities and your
distresses; and you have said to him, ‘No! Set a king over us.’ Now
therefore present yourselves before Yahweh by your tribes, and by your
thousands.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,20);</script>So Samuel brought all
the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,21);</script>He brought the tribe of Benjamin
near by their families; and the family of the Matrites was taken; and Saul
the son of Kish was taken: but when they sought him, he could not be
found. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,22);</script>Therefore they
asked of Yahweh further, “Is there yet a man to come here?”
<p>Yahweh answered, “Behold, he has hidden himself among the baggage.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,23);</script>They ran and fetched
him there; and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of
the people from his shoulders and upward. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,24);</script>Samuel said to all the people,
“You see him whom Yahweh has chosen, that there is none like him among
all the people?”
<p>All the people shouted, and said, “Let the king live!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,25);</script>Then Samuel told the
people the regulations of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it
up before Yahweh. Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(10,26);</script>Saul also went to his
house to Gibeah; and there went with him the army, whose hearts God had
touched. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,27);</script>But certain
worthless fellows said, “How shall this man save us?” They despised
him, and brought him no present. But he held his peace.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,1);</script>Then Nahash the
Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabesh Gilead: and all the men of
Jabesh said to Nahash, “Make a covenant with us, and we will serve
you.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,2);</script>Nahash the
Ammonite said to them, “On this condition I will make it with you, that
all your right eyes be put out; and I will lay it for a reproach on all
Israel.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,3);</script>The elders of Jabesh
said to him, “Give us seven day, that we may send messengers to all the
borders of Israel; and then, if there is no one to save us, we will come
out to you.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,4);</script>Then the
messengers came to Gibeah of Saul, and spoke these words in the ears of
the people: and all the people lifted up their voice, and wept.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,5);</script>Behold, Saul came
following the oxen out of the field; and Saul said, “What ails the
people that they weep?” They told him the words of the men of Jabesh.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,6);</script>The Spirit of God came
mightily on Saul when he heard those words, and his anger was kindled
greatly. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,7);</script>He took a yoke
of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the borders
of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, “Whoever doesn’t come
forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen.” The
dread of Yahweh fell on the people, and they came out as one man. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,8);</script>He numbered them in Bezek; and
the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah
thirty thousand. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,9);</script>They
said to the messengers who came, “Thus you shall tell the men of Jabesh
Gilead, ‘Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you shall have
deliverance.’” The messengers came and told the men of Jabesh; and
they were glad. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,10);</script>Therefore the men of Jabesh
said, “Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you shall do with us all
that seems good to you.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,11);</script>It was so on the next day, that
Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of
the camp in the morning watch, and struck the Ammonites until the heat of
the day: and it happened, that those who remained were scattered, so that
no two of them were left together. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,12);</script>The people said to Samuel,
“Who is he who said, ‘Shall Saul reign over us?’ Bring those men,
that we may put them to death!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,13);</script>Saul said, “There
shall not a man be put to death this day; for today Yahweh has worked
deliverance in Israel.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,14);</script>Then Samuel said to the people,
“Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,15);</script>All the people went to Gilgal;
and there they made Saul king before Yahweh in Gilgal; and there they
offered sacrifices of peace offerings before Yahweh; and there Saul and
all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,1);</script>Samuel said to all
Israel, “Behold, I have listened to your voice in all that you said to
me, and have made a king over you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,2);</script>Now, behold, the king walks
before you; and I am old and gray-headed; and behold, my sons are with
you: and I have walked before you from my youth to this day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,3);</script>Here I am. Witness against me
before Yahweh, and before his anointed. Whose ox have I taken? Whose
donkey have I taken? Whom have I defrauded? Whom have I oppressed? Of
whose hand have I taken a ransom to blind my eyes therewith? I will
restore it to you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,4);</script>They said, “You have
not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither have you taken anything of any
man’s hand.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,5);</script>He said to them,
“Yahweh is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day,
that you have not found anything in my hand.”
<p>They said, “He is witness.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,6);</script>Samuel said to the people, “It
is Yahweh who appointed Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up
out of the land of Egypt. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,7);</script>Now therefore stand still, that I
may plead with you before Yahweh concerning all the righteous acts of
Yahweh, which he did to you and to your fathers.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,8);</script>“When Jacob had come
into Egypt, and your fathers cried to Yahweh, then Yahweh sent Moses and
Aaron, who brought your fathers out of Egypt, and made them to dwell in
this place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,9);</script>“But they forgot
Yahweh their God; and he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the
army of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of
the king of Moab; and they fought against them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,10);</script>They cried to Yahweh, and said,
‘We have sinned, because we have forsaken Yahweh, and have served the
Baals and the Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our
enemies, and we will serve you.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,11);</script>Yahweh sent Jerubbaal, and
Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your
enemies on every side; and you lived in safety.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,12);</script>“When you saw that
Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, you said to me,
‘No, but a king shall reign over us;’ when Yahweh your God was your
king. <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,13);</script>Now therefore see
the king whom you have chosen, and whom you have asked for: and behold,
Yahweh has set a king over you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,14);</script>If you will fear Yahweh, and
serve him, and listen to his voice, and not rebel against the commandment
of Yahweh, then both you and also the king who reigns over you are
followers of Yahweh your God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,15);</script>But if you will not listen to
the voice of Yahweh, but rebel against the commandment of Yahweh, then
will the hand of Yahweh be against you, as it was against your fathers.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,16);</script>“Now therefore
stand still and see this great thing, which Yahweh will do before your
eyes. <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,17);</script>Isn’t it wheat
harvest today? I will call to Yahweh, that he may send thunder and rain;
and you shall know and see that your wickedness is great, which you have
done in the sight of Yahweh, in asking for a king.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,18);</script>So Samuel called to
Yahweh; and Yahweh sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people
greatly feared Yahweh and Samuel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,19);</script>All the people said
to Samuel, “Pray for your servants to Yahweh your God, that we not die;
for we have added to all our sins this evil, to ask us a king.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,20);</script>Samuel said to the
people, “Don’t be afraid. You have indeed done all this evil; yet
don’t turn aside from following Yahweh, but serve Yahweh with all your
heart. <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,21);</script>Don’t turn
aside to go after vain things which can’t profit nor deliver, for they
are vain. <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,22);</script>For Yahweh
will not forsake his people for his great name’s sake, because it has
pleased Yahweh to make you a people to himself. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,23);</script>Moreover as for me, far be it
from me that I should sin against Yahweh in ceasing to pray for you: but I
will instruct you in the good and the right way. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,24);</script>Only fear Yahweh, and serve him
in truth with all your heart; for consider how great things he has done
for you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,25);</script>But if you
shall still do wickedly, you shall be consumed, both you and your king.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,1);</script>Saul reigned a year;
and when he had reigned two years over Israel, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,2);</script>Saul chose for himself three
thousand men of Israel, of which two thousand were with Saul in Michmash
and in the Mount of Bethel, and one thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah
of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,3);</script>Jonathan struck the
garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba: and the Philistines heard of
it. Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, “Let the
Hebrews hear!” <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,4);</script>All
Israel heard that Saul had struck the garrison of the Philistines, and
also that Israel was had in abomination with the Philistines. The people
were gathered together after Saul to Gilgal. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,5);</script>The Philistines assembled
themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and
six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the seashore in
multitude: and they came up, and encamped in Michmash, eastward of Beth
Aven. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,6);</script>When the men of
Israel saw that they were in a strait (for the people were distressed),
then the people hid themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks,
and in coverts, and in pits. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,7);</script>Now some of the Hebrews had gone
over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead; but as for Saul, he was yet
in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,8);</script>He stayed seven days, according
to the time set by Samuel: but Samuel didn’t come to Gilgal; and the
people were scattered from him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,9);</script>Saul said, “Bring here the
burnt offering to me, and the peace offerings.” He offered the burnt
offering.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,10);</script>It came to pass that
as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold,
Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might greet him.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,11);</script>Samuel said, “What
have you done?”
<p>Saul said, “Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and
that you didn’t come within the days appointed, and that the Philistines
assembled themselves together at Michmash; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,12);</script>therefore I said, ‘Now the
Philistines will come down on me to Gilgal, and I haven’t entreated the
favor of Yahweh.’ I forced myself therefore, and offered the burnt
offering.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,13);</script>Samuel said to Saul,
“You have done foolishly. You have not kept the commandment of Yahweh
your God, which he commanded you; for now Yahweh would have established
your kingdom on Israel forever. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,14);</script>But now your kingdom shall not
continue. Yahweh has sought for himself a man after his own heart, and
Yahweh has appointed him to be prince over his people, because you have
not kept that which Yahweh commanded you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,15);</script>Samuel arose, and
went from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. Saul numbered the people who were
present with him, about six hundred men. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,16);</script>Saul, and Jonathan his son, and
the people who were present with them, stayed in Geba of Benjamin: but the
Philistines encamped in Michmash. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,17);</script>The spoilers came out of the
camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned to the way
that leads to Ophrah, to the land of Shual; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,18);</script>and another company turned the
way to Beth Horon; and another company turned the way of the border that
looks down on the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,19);</script>Now there was no smith found
throughout all the land of Israel; for the Philistines said, “Lest the
Hebrews make them swords or spears”; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,20);</script>but all the Israelites went down
to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his plowshare, mattock, axe, and
sickle; <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,21);</script>yet they had a
file for the mattocks, and for the plowshares, and for the forks, and for
the axes, and to set the goads. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,22);</script>So it came to pass in the day of
battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of
the people who were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with
Jonathan his son was there found. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,23);</script>The garrison of the Philistines
went out to the pass of Michmash.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,1);</script>Now it fell on a day,
that Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who bore his armor,
“Come, and let us go over to the Philistines’ garrison, that is on the
other side.” But he didn’t tell his father. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,2);</script>Saul stayed in the uttermost part
of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people
who were with him were about six hundred men; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,3);</script>and Ahijah, the son of Ahitub,
Ichabod’s brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of
Yahweh in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. The people didn’t know that Jonathan
was gone. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,4);</script>Between the
passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines’
garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side, and a rocky crag on the
other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other
Seneh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,5);</script>The one crag rose
up on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front
of Geba. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,6);</script>Jonathan said to
the young man who bore his armor, “Come, and let us go over to the
garrison of these uncircumcised. It may be that Yahweh will work for us;
for there is no restraint on Yahweh to save by many or by few.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,7);</script>His armor bearer said to him,
“Do all that is in your heart. Turn and, behold, I am with you according
to your heart.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,8);</script>Then
Jonathan said, “Behold, we will pass over to the men, and we will reveal
ourselves to them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,9);</script>If
they say thus to us, ‘Wait until we come to you!’ then we will stand
still in our place, and will not go up to them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,10);</script>But if they say this, ‘Come up
to us!’ then we will go up; for Yahweh has delivered them into our hand.
This shall be the sign to us.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,11);</script>Both of them revealed
themselves to the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said,
“Behold, the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they had hidden
themselves!” <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,12);</script>The men
of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armor bearer, and said, “Come
up to us, and we will show you something!”
<p>Jonathan said to his armor bearer, “Come up after me; for Yahweh has
delivered them into the hand of Israel.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,13);</script>Jonathan climbed up on his hands
and on his feet, and his armor bearer after him: and they fell before
Jonathan; and his armor bearer killed them after him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,14);</script>That first slaughter, which
Jonathan and his armor bearer made, was about twenty men, within as it
were half a furrow’s length in an acre of land. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,15);</script>There was a trembling in the
camp, in the field, and among all the people; the garrison, and the
spoilers, they also trembled; and the earth quaked: so there was an
exceeding great trembling. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,16);</script>The watchmen of Saul in Gibeah
of Benjamin looked; and behold, the multitude melted away, and scattered.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(14,17);</script>Then Saul said to the
people who were with him, “Count now, and see who is missing from us.”
When they had counted, behold, Jonathan and his armor bearer were not
there.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,18);</script>Saul said to Ahijah,
“Bring the ark of God here.” For the ark of God was with the children
of Israel at that time. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,19);</script>It happened, while Saul talked
to the priest, that the tumult that was in the camp of the Philistines
went on and increased: and Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw your
hand!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,20);</script>Saul and all the
people who were with him were gathered together, and came to the battle:
and behold, every man’s sword was against his fellow: a very great
confusion. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,21);</script>Now the
Hebrews who were with the Philistines as before, and who went up with them
into the camp, from all around, even they also turned to be with the
Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,22);</script>Likewise all the men of Israel
who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim, when they heard
that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the
battle. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,23);</script>So Yahweh saved
Israel that day: and the battle passed over by Beth Aven.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,24);</script>The men of Israel
were distressed that day; for Saul had adjured the people, saying,
“Cursed is the man who eats any food until it is evening, and I am
avenged of my enemies.” So none of the people tasted food.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,25);</script>All the people came
into the forest; and there was honey on the ground. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,26);</script>When the people had come to the
forest, behold, the honey dropped: but no man put his hand to his mouth;
for the people feared the oath. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,27);</script>But Jonathan didn’t hear when
his father commanded the people with the oath: therefore he put forth the
end of the rod who was in his hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and
put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,28);</script>Then one of the people answered,
and said, “Your father directly commanded the people with an oath,
saying, ‘Cursed is the man who eats food this day.’” The people were
faint. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,29);</script>Then Jonathan
said, “My father has troubled the land. Please look how my eyes have
been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,30);</script>How much more, if perhaps the
people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they
found? For now has there been no great slaughter among the Philistines.”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(14,31);</script>They struck of the
Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. The people were very faint;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(14,32);</script>and the people flew on
the spoil, and took sheep, and cattle, and calves, and killed them on the
ground; and the people ate them with the blood. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,33);</script>Then they told Saul, saying,
“Behold, the people are sinning against Yahweh, in that they eat meat
with the blood.”
<p>He said, “You have dealt treacherously. Roll a large stone to me this
day!” <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,34);</script>Saul said,
“Disperse yourselves among the people, and tell them, ‘Bring me here
every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and kill them here, and eat;
and don’t sin against Yahweh in eating meat with the blood.’” All
the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and killed them
there.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,35);</script>Saul built an altar
to Yahweh. This was the first altar that he built to Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,36);</script>Saul said, “Let us go down
after the Philistines by night, and take spoil among them until the
morning light, and let us not leave a man of them.”
<p>They said, “Do whatever seems good to you.”
<p>Then the priest said, “Let us draw near here to God.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,37);</script>Saul asked counsel of
God, “Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will you deliver them into
the hand of Israel?” But he didn’t answer him that day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,38);</script>Saul said, “Draw near here,
all you chiefs of the people; and know and see in which this sin has been
this day. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,39);</script>For, as Yahweh
lives, who saves Israel, though it is in Jonathan my son, he shall surely
die.” But there was not a man among all the people who answered him.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(14,40);</script>Then he said to all
Israel, “You be on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the
other side.”
<p>The people said to Saul, “Do what seems good to you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,41);</script>Therefore Saul said
to Yahweh, the God of Israel, “Show the right.”
<p>Jonathan and Saul were chosen; but the people escaped.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,42);</script>Saul said, “Cast
lots between me and Jonathan my son.”
<p>Jonathan was selected.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,43);</script>Then Saul said to
Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done!”
<p>Jonathan told him, and said, “I certainly did taste a little honey
with the end of the rod that was in my hand; and behold, I must die.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,44);</script>Saul said, “God do
so and more also; for you shall surely die, Jonathan.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,45);</script>The people said to
Saul, “Shall Jonathan die, who has worked this great salvation in
Israel? Far from it! As Yahweh lives, there shall not one hair of his head
fall to the ground; for he has worked with God this day!” So the people
rescued Jonathan, that he didn’t die.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,46);</script>Then Saul went up
from following the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own
place. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,47);</script>Now when Saul had
taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every
side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom,
and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and wherever
he turned himself, he defeated them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,48);</script>He did valiantly, and struck the
Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who despoiled
them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,49);</script>Now the sons of
Saul were Jonathan, and Ishvi, and Malchishua; and the names of his two
daughters were these: the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the
younger Michal: <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,50);</script>and the
name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the
captain of his army was Abner the son of Ner, Saul’s uncle. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,51);</script>Kish was the father of Saul; and
Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,52);</script>There was severe war against the
Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any mighty man, or any
valiant man, he took him to him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,1);</script>Samuel said to Saul,
“Yahweh sent me to anoint you to be king over his people, over Israel.
Now therefore listen to the voice of the words of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,2);</script>Thus says Yahweh of Armies, ‘I
have marked that which Amalek did to Israel, how he set himself against
him in the way, when he came up out of Egypt. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,3);</script>Now go and strike Amalek, and
utterly destroy all that they have, and don’t spare them; but kill both
man and woman, infant and nursing baby, ox and sheep, camel and
donkey.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,4);</script>Saul summoned the
people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten
thousand men of Judah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,5);</script>Saul came to the city of Amalek,
and laid wait in the valley. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,6);</script>Saul said to the Kenites, “Go,
depart, go down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them;
for you showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up
out of Egypt.” So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,7);</script>Saul struck the
Amalekites, from Havilah as you go to Shur, that is before Egypt. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,8);</script>He took Agag the king of the
Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of
the sword. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,9);</script>But Saul and
the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the cattle, and
of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and wouldn’t
utterly destroy them: but everything that was vile and refuse, that they
destroyed utterly. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,10);</script>Then
the word of Yahweh came to Samuel, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,11);</script>“It grieves me that I have set
up Saul to be king; for he is turned back from following me, and has not
performed my commandments.” Samuel was angry; and he cried to Yahweh all
night.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,12);</script>Samuel rose early to
meet Saul in the morning; and it was told Samuel, saying, “Saul came to
Carmel, and behold, he set up a monument for himself, and turned, and
passed on, and went down to Gilgal.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,13);</script>Samuel came to Saul;
and Saul said to him, “You are blessed by Yahweh! I have performed the
commandment of Yahweh.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,14);</script>Samuel said, “Then
what does this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the
cattle which I hear mean?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,15);</script>Saul said, “They
have brought them from the Amalekites; for the people spared the best of
the sheep and of the cattle, to sacrifice to Yahweh your God. We have
utterly destroyed the rest.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,16);</script>Then Samuel said to
Saul, “Stay, and I will tell you what Yahweh has said to me last
night.”
<p>He said to him, “Say on.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,17);</script>Samuel said,
“Though you were little in your own sight, weren’t you made the head
of the tribes of Israel? Yahweh anointed you king over Israel; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,18);</script>and Yahweh sent you on a
journey, and said, ‘Go, and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites,
and fight against them until they are consumed.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,19);</script>Why then didn’t you obey the
voice of Yahweh, but took the spoils, and did that which was evil in the
sight of Yahweh?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,20);</script>Saul said to Samuel,
“But I have obeyed the voice of Yahweh, and have gone the way which
Yahweh sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly
destroyed the Amalekites. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,21);</script>But the people took of the
spoil, sheep and cattle, the chief of the devoted things, to sacrifice to
Yahweh your God in Gilgal.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,22);</script>Samuel said, “Has
Yahweh as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying
the voice of Yahweh? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to
listen than the fat of rams. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,23);</script>For rebellion is as the sin of
witchcraft, and stubbornness is as idolatry and teraphim. Because you have
rejected the word of Yahweh, he has also rejected you from being king.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,24);</script>Saul said to Samuel,
“I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of Yahweh, and
your words, because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,25);</script>Now therefore, please pardon my
sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship Yahweh.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,26);</script>Samuel said to Saul,
“I will not return with you; for you have rejected the word of Yahweh,
and Yahweh has rejected you from being king over Israel.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,27);</script>As Samuel turned about to go
away, Saul grabbed the skirt of his robe, and it tore. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,28);</script>Samuel said to him, “Yahweh
has torn the kingdom of Israel from you this day, and has given it to a
neighbor of yours who is better than you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,29);</script>Also the Strength of Israel will
not lie nor repent; for he is not a man, that he should repent.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,30);</script>Then he said, “I
have sinned: yet please honor me now before the elders of my people, and
before Israel, and come back with me, that I may worship Yahweh your
God.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,31);</script>So Samuel went back
with Saul; and Saul worshiped Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,32);</script>Then Samuel said, “Bring here
to me Agag the king of the Amalekites!”
<p>Agag came to him cheerfully. Agag said, “Surely the bitterness of
death is past.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,33);</script>Samuel said, “As
your sword has made women childless, so your mother will be childless
among women!” Samuel cut Agag in pieces before Yahweh in Gilgal.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,34);</script>Then Samuel went to
Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,35);</script>Samuel came no more to see Saul
until the day of his death; for Samuel mourned for Saul: and Yahweh
grieved that he had made Saul king over Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,1);</script>Yahweh said to Samuel,
“How long will you mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him from being
king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil, and go. I will send you to
Jesse the Bethlehemite; for I have provided a king for myself among his
sons.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,2);</script>Samuel said, “How
can I go? If Saul hears it, he will kill me.”
<p>Yahweh said, “Take a heifer with you, and say, I have come to
sacrifice to Yahweh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,3);</script>Call
Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do. You shall
anoint to me him whom I name to you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,4);</script>Samuel did that which
Yahweh spoke, and came to Bethlehem. The elders of the city came to meet
him trembling, and said, “Do you come peaceably?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,5);</script>He said, “Peaceably;
I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh. Sanctify yourselves, and come with me
to the sacrifice.” He sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to
the sacrifice. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,6);</script>It
happened, when they had come, that he looked at Eliab, and said, “Surely
Yahweh’s anointed is before him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,7);</script>But Yahweh said to
Samuel, “Don’t look on his face, or on the height of his stature;
because I have rejected him: for I see not as man sees; for man looks at
the outward appearance, but Yahweh looks at the heart.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,8);</script>Then Jesse called Abinadab, and
made him pass before Samuel. He said, “Neither has Yahweh chosen this
one.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,9);</script>Then Jesse made
Shammah to pass by. He said, “Neither has Yahweh chosen this one.”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(16,10);</script>Jesse made seven of his
sons to pass before Samuel. Samuel said to Jesse, “Yahweh has not chosen
these.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,11);</script>Samuel said to
Jesse, “Are all your children here?”
<p>He said, “There remains yet the youngest, and behold, he is keeping
the sheep.”
<p>Samuel said to Jesse, “Send and get him; for we will not sit down
until he comes here.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,12);</script>He sent, and brought
him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful face, and goodly to
look on. Yahweh said, “Arise, anoint him; for this is he.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,13);</script>Then Samuel took the
horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brothers: and the Spirit
of Yahweh came mightily on David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up,
and went to Ramah. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,14);</script>Now
the Spirit of Yahweh departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from Yahweh
troubled him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,15);</script>Saul’s
servants said to him, “See now, an evil spirit from God troubles you.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(16,16);</script>Let our lord now command
your servants who are before you, to seek out a man who is a skillful
player on the harp. It shall happen, when the evil spirit from God is on
you, that he shall play with his hand, and you shall be well.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,17);</script>Saul said to his
servants, “Provide me now a man who can play well, and bring him to
me.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,18);</script>Then one of the young
men answered, and said, “Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the
Bethlehemite, who is skillful in playing, a mighty man of valor, a man of
war, prudent in speech, and a comely person; and Yahweh is with him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,19);</script>Therefore Saul sent
messengers to Jesse, and said, “Send me David your son, who is with the
sheep.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,20);</script>Jesse took a donkey
loaded with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a young goat, and sent them
by David his son to Saul. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,21);</script>David came to Saul, and stood
before him. He loved him greatly; and he became his armor bearer. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,22);</script>Saul sent to Jesse, saying,
“Please let David stand before me; for he has found favor in my
sight.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,23);</script>It happened,
when the spirit from God was on Saul, that David took the harp, and played
with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit
departed from him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,1);</script>Now the Philistines
gathered together their armies to battle; and they were gathered together
at Socoh, which belongs to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah,
in Ephesdammim. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,2);</script>Saul and
the men of Israel were gathered together, and encamped in the valley of
Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,3);</script>The Philistines stood on the
mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on the mountain on the other
side: and there was a valley between them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,4);</script>There went out a champion out of
the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six
cubits and a span. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,5);</script>He had
a helmet of brass on his head, and he was clad with a coat of mail; and
the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,6);</script>He had brass shin armor on his
legs, and a javelin of brass between his shoulders. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,7);</script>The staff of his spear was like a
weaver’s beam; and his spear’s head weighed six hundred shekels of
iron: and his shield bearer went before him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,8);</script>He stood and cried to the armies
of Israel, and said to them, “Why have you come out to set your battle
in array? Am I not a Philistine, and you servants to Saul? Choose a man
for yourselves, and let him come down to me. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,9);</script>If he be able to fight with me,
and kill me, then will we be your servants; but if I prevail against him,
and kill him, then you will be our servants, and serve us.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,10);</script>The Philistine said, “I defy
the armies of Israel this day! Give me a man, that we may fight
together!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,11);</script>When Saul and all
Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and
greatly afraid. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,12);</script>Now
David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehem Judah, whose name was
Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man was an old man in the days of
Saul, stricken among men. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,13);</script>The three eldest sons of Jesse
had gone after Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons who
went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next to him Abinadab, and
the third Shammah. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,14);</script>David
was the youngest; and the three eldest followed Saul. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,15);</script>Now David went back and forth
from Saul to feed his father’s sheep at Bethlehem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,16);</script>The Philistine drew near morning
and evening, and presented himself forty days. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,17);</script>Jesse said to David his son,
“Now take for your brothers an <a href="#N8">ephah</a> of this parched
grain, and these ten loaves, and carry them quickly to the camp to your
brothers; <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,18);</script>and bring
these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand, and see how your
brothers are doing, and bring back news.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,19);</script>Now Saul, and they, and all the
men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(17,20);</script>David rose up early in
the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as
Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the place of the wagons, as the
army which was going forth to the fight shouted for the battle. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,21);</script>Israel and the Philistines put
the battle in array, army against army. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,22);</script>David left his baggage in the
hand of the keeper of the baggage, and ran to the army, and came and
greeted his brothers. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,23);</script>As
he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of
Gath, Goliath by name, out of the ranks of the Philistines, and spoke
according to the same words: and David heard them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,24);</script>All the men of Israel, when they
saw the man, fled from him, and were terrified. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,25);</script>The men of Israel said, “Have
you seen this man who has come up? He has surely come up to defy Israel.
It shall be, that the man who kills him, the king will enrich him with
great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father’s
house free in Israel.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,26);</script>David spoke to the
men who stood by him, saying, “What shall be done to the man who kills
this Philistine, and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this
uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living
God?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,27);</script>The people answered
him in this way, saying, “So shall it be done to the man who kills
him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,28);</script>Eliab his eldest
brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab’s anger was kindled
against David, and he said, “Why have you come down? With whom have you
left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride, and the
naughtiness of your heart; for you have come down that you might see the
battle.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,29);</script>David said, “What
have I now done? Is there not a cause?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,30);</script>He turned away from him toward
another, and spoke like that again; and the people answered him again the
same way. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,31);</script>When the words
were heard which David spoke, they rehearsed them before Saul; and he sent
for him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,32);</script>David said to
Saul, “Let no man’s heart fail because of him. Your servant will go
and fight with this Philistine.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,33);</script>Saul said to David,
“You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for
you are but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,34);</script>David said to Saul,
“Your servant was keeping his father’s sheep; and when a lion or a
bear came, and took a lamb out of the flock, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,35);</script>I went out after him, and struck
him, and rescued it out of his mouth. When he arose against me, I caught
him by his beard, and struck him, and killed him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,36);</script>Your servant struck both the
lion and the bear. This uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them,
since he has defied the armies of the living God.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,37);</script>David said, “Yahweh who
delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear,
he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine.”
<p>Saul said to David, “Go; and Yahweh shall be with you.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,38);</script>Saul dressed David with his
clothing. He put a helmet of brass on his head, and he clad him with a
coat of mail. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,39);</script>David
strapped his sword on his clothing, and he tried to move; for he had not
tested it. David said to Saul, “I can’t go with these; for I have not
tested them.” David took them off.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,40);</script>He took his staff in
his hand, and chose for himself five smooth stones out of the brook, and
put them in the shepherd’s bag which he had, even in his wallet. His
sling was in his hand; and he drew near to the Philistine. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,41);</script>The Philistine came on and drew
near to David; and the man who bore the shield went before him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,42);</script>When the Philistine looked
about, and saw David, he disdained him; for he was but a youth, and ruddy,
and withal of a fair face. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,43);</script>The Philistine said to David,
“Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?” The Philistine cursed
David by his gods. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,44);</script>The
Philistine said to David, “Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the
birds of the sky, and to the animals of the field.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,45);</script>Then David said to
the Philistine, “You come to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with
a javelin: but I come to you in the name of Yahweh of Armies, the God of
the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,46);</script>Today, Yahweh will deliver you
into my hand. I will strike you, and take your head from off you. I will
give the dead bodies of the army of the Philistines this day to the birds
of the sky, and to the wild animals of the earth; that all the earth may
know that there is a God in Israel, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,47);</script>and that all this assembly may
know that Yahweh doesn’t save with sword and spear: for the battle is
Yahweh’s, and he will give you into our hand.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,48);</script>It happened, when the
Philistine arose, and came and drew near to meet David, that David
hurried, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,49);</script>David put his hand in his bag,
took a stone, and slung it, and struck the Philistine in his forehead; and
the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the earth.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(17,50);</script>So David prevailed over
the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and struck the Philistine,
and killed him; but there was no sword in the hand of David. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,51);</script>Then David ran, and stood over
the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of its sheath, and
killed him, and cut off his head therewith. When the Philistines saw that
their champion was dead, they fled. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,52);</script>The men of Israel and of Judah
arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until you come to Gai,
and to the gates of Ekron. The wounded of the Philistines fell down by the
way to Shaaraim, even to Gath, and to Ekron. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,53);</script>The children of Israel returned
from chasing after the Philistines, and they plundered their camp. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,54);</script>David took the head of the
Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armor in his tent.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(17,55);</script>When Saul saw David go
forth against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the captain of the army,
“Abner, whose son is this youth?”
<p>Abner said, “As your soul lives, O king, I can’t tell.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,56);</script>The king said,
“Inquire whose son the young man is!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,57);</script>As David returned
from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him
before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,58);</script>Saul said to him, “Whose son
are you, you young man?”
<p>David answered, “I am the son of your servant Jesse the
Bethlehemite.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,1);</script>It happened, when he
had made an end of speaking to Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit
with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,2);</script>Saul took him that day, and would
let him go no more home to his father’s house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,3);</script>Then Jonathan and David made a
covenant, because he loved him as his own soul. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,4);</script>Jonathan stripped himself of the
robe that was on him, and gave it to David, and his clothing, even to his
sword, and to his bow, and to his sash. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,5);</script>David went out wherever Saul sent
him, and behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and
it was good in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of
Saul’s servants. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,6);</script>It
happened as they came, when David returned from the slaughter of the
Philistine, that the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing
and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tambourines, with joy, and with
instruments of music. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,7);</script>The
women sang one to another as they played, and said,
<dl>
<dt>“Saul has slain his thousands,
<dd>David his ten thousands.”
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,8);</script>Saul was very angry,
and this saying displeased him; and he said, “They have ascribed to
David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands. What can
he have more but the kingdom?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,9);</script>Saul eyed David from that day and
forward. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,10);</script>It happened on
the next day, that an evil spirit from God came mightily on Saul, and he
prophesied in the midst of the house. David played with his hand, as he
did day by day. Saul had his spear in his hand; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,11);</script>and Saul threw the spear; for he
said, “I will pin David even to the wall!” David escaped from his
presence twice. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,12);</script>Saul was
afraid of David, because Yahweh was with him, and was departed from Saul.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,13);</script>Therefore Saul removed
him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out
and came in before the people.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,14);</script>David behaved himself
wisely in all his ways; and Yahweh was with him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,15);</script>When Saul saw that he behaved
himself very wisely, he stood in awe of him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,16);</script>But all Israel and Judah loved
David; for he went out and came in before them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,17);</script>Saul said to David, “Behold,
my elder daughter Merab, I will give her to you as wife. Only be valiant
for me, and fight Yahweh’s battles.” For Saul said, “Don’t let my
hand be on him, but let the hand of the Philistines be on him.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,18);</script>David said to Saul, “Who am I,
and what is my life, or my father’s family in Israel, that I should be
son-in-law to the king?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,19);</script>But it happened at
the time when Merab, Saul’s daughter, should have been given to David,
that she was given to Adriel the Meholathite as wife. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,20);</script>Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved
David; and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,21);</script>Saul said, I will give her to
him, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines
may be against him. Therefore Saul said to David, “You shall this day be
my son-in-law a second time.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,22);</script>Saul commanded his servants,
“Talk with David secretly, and say, ‘Behold, the king has delight in
you, and all his servants love you: now therefore be the king’s
son-in-law.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,23);</script>Saul’s servants
spoke those words in the ears of David. David said, “Does it seems to
you a light thing to be the king’s son-in-law, since I am a poor man,
and lightly esteemed?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,24);</script>The servants of Saul
told him, saying, “David spoke like this.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,25);</script>Saul said, “You
shall tell David, ‘The king desires no dowry except one hundred
foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king’s enemies.’”
Now Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,26);</script>When his servants told
David these words, it pleased David well to be the king’s son-in-law.
The days were not expired; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,27);</script>and David arose and went, he and
his men, and killed of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought
their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king, that he
might be the king’s son-in-law. Saul gave him Michal his daughter as
wife. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,28);</script>Saul saw and knew
that Yahweh was with David; and Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved him.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,29);</script>Saul was yet the more
afraid of David; and Saul was David’s enemy continually. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,30);</script>Then the princes of the
Philistines went forth: and it happened, as often as they went forth, that
David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that
his name was highly esteemed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,1);</script>Saul spoke to Jonathan
his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David. But
Jonathan, Saul’s son, delighted much in David. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,2);</script>Jonathan told David, saying,
“Saul my father seeks to kill you. Now therefore, please take care of
yourself in the morning, and live in a secret place, and hide yourself.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(19,3);</script>I will go out and stand
beside my father in the field where you are, and I will talk with my
father about you; and if I see anything, I will tell you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,4);</script>Jonathan spoke good of
David to Saul his father, and said to him, “Don’t let the king sin
against his servant, against David; because he has not sinned against you,
and because his works have been very good toward you; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,5);</script>for he put his life in his hand,
and struck the Philistine, and Yahweh worked a great victory for all
Israel. You saw it, and rejoiced. Why then will you sin against innocent
blood, to kill David without a cause?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,6);</script>Saul listened to the
voice of Jonathan: and Saul swore, “As Yahweh lives, he shall not be put
to death.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,7);</script>Jonathan called David,
and Jonathan showed him all those things. Jonathan brought David to Saul,
and he was in his presence, as before. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,8);</script>There was war again. David went
out, and fought with the Philistines, and killed them with a great
slaughter; and they fled before him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,9);</script>An evil spirit from
Yahweh was on Saul, as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand; and
David was playing with his hand. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,10);</script>Saul sought to pin David even to
the wall with the spear; but he slipped away out of Saul’s presence, and
he stuck the spear into the wall. David fled, and escaped that night.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(19,11);</script>Saul sent messengers to
David’s house, to watch him, and to kill him in the morning. Michal,
David’s wife, told him, saying, “If you don’t save your life
tonight, tomorrow you will be killed.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,12);</script>So Michal let David down through
the window. He went, fled, and escaped. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,13);</script>Michal took the teraphim, and
laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats’ hair at its head, and
covered it with the clothes. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,14);</script>When Saul sent messengers to
take David, she said, “He is sick.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,15);</script>Saul sent the
messengers to see David, saying, “Bring him up to me in the bed, that I
may kill him.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,16);</script>When
the messengers came in, behold, the teraphim was in the bed, with the
pillow of goats’ hair at its head.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,17);</script>Saul said to Michal,
“Why have you deceived me thus, and let my enemy go, so that he is
escaped?”
<p>Michal answered Saul, “He said to me, ‘Let me go! Why should I kill
you?’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,18);</script>Now David fled, and
escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done
to him. He and Samuel went and lived in Naioth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,19);</script>It was told Saul, saying,
“Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,20);</script>Saul sent messengers
to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying,
and Samuel standing as head over them, the Spirit of God came on the
messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,21);</script>When it was told Saul, he sent
other messengers, and they also prophesied. Saul sent messengers again the
third time, and they also prophesied. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,22);</script>Then went he also to Ramah, and
came to the great well that is in Secu: and he asked, “Where are Samuel
and David?”
<p>One said, “Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,23);</script>He went there to
Naioth in Ramah. Then the Spirit of God came on him also, and he went on,
and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,24);</script>He also stripped off his
clothes, and he also prophesied before Samuel, and lay down naked all that
day and all that night. Therefore they say, “Is Saul also among the
prophets?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,1);</script>David fled from Naioth
in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, “What have I done? What is
my iniquity? What is my sin before your father, that he seeks my life?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,2);</script>He said to him, “Far
from it; you shall not die. Behold, my father does nothing either great or
small, but that he discloses it to me; and why should my father hide this
thing from me? It is not so.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,3);</script>David swore moreover,
and said, “Your father knows well that I have found favor in your eyes;
and he says, ‘Don’t let Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved:’ but
truly as Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, there is but a step between
me and death.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,4);</script>Then Jonathan said to
David, “Whatever your soul desires, I will even do it for you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,5);</script>David said to
Jonathan, “Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to
dine with the king; but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field to
the third day at evening. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,6);</script>If your father miss me at all,
then say, ‘David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to
Bethlehem his city; for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the
family.’ <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,7);</script>If he says,
‘It is well;’ your servant shall have peace: but if he be angry, then
know that evil is determined by him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,8);</script>Therefore deal kindly with your
servant; for you have brought your servant into a covenant of Yahweh with
you: but if there is iniquity in me, kill me yourself; for why should you
bring me to your father?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,9);</script>Jonathan said, “Far
be it from you; for if I should at all know that evil were determined by
my father to come on you, then wouldn’t I tell you that?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,10);</script>Then David said to
Jonathan, “Who shall tell me if perchance your father answers you
roughly?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,11);</script>Jonathan said to
David, “Come, and let us go out into the field.” They both went out
into the field. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,12);</script>Jonathan
said to David, “By Yahweh, the God of Israel, when I have sounded my
father about this time tomorrow, or the third day, behold, if there is
good toward David, shall I not then send to you, and disclose it to you?
<script type="text/javascript">cb(20,13);</script>Yahweh do so to
Jonathan, and more also, should it please my father to do you evil, if I
don’t disclose it to you, and send you away, that you may go in peace:
and Yahweh be with you, as he has been with my father. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,14);</script>You shall not only while yet I
live show me the loving kindness of Yahweh, that I not die; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,15);</script>but also you shall not cut off
your kindness from my house forever; no, not when Yahweh has cut off the
enemies of David everyone from the surface of the earth.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,16);</script>So Jonathan made a covenant with
the house of David, saying, “Yahweh will require it at the hand of
David’s enemies.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,17);</script>Jonathan caused David to swear
again, for the love that he had to him; for he loved him as he loved his
own soul. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,18);</script>Then Jonathan
said to him, “Tomorrow is the new moon: and you will be missed, because
your seat will be empty. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,19);</script>When you have stayed three days,
you shall go down quickly, and come to the place where you hid yourself
when this started, and shall remain by the stone Ezel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,20);</script>I will shoot three arrows on its
side, as though I shot at a mark. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,21);</script>Behold, I will send the boy,
saying, ‘Go, find the arrows!’ If I tell the boy, ‘Behold, the
arrows are on this side of you. Take them;’ then come; for there is
peace to you and no hurt, as Yahweh lives. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,22);</script>But if I say this to the boy,
‘Behold, the arrows are beyond you;’ then go your way; for Yahweh has
sent you away. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,23);</script>Concerning the matter which you
and I have spoken of, behold, Yahweh is between you and me forever.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,24);</script>So David hid himself
in the field: and when the new moon had come, the king sat him down to eat
food. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,25);</script>The king sat on
his seat, as at other times, even on the seat by the wall; and Jonathan
stood up, and Abner sat by Saul’s side: but David’s place was empty.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(20,26);</script>Nevertheless Saul
didn’t say anything that day: for he thought, “Something has happened
to him. He is not clean. Surely he is not clean.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,27);</script>It happened on the
next day after the new moon, the second day, that David’s place was
empty. Saul said to Jonathan his son, “Why doesn’t the son of Jesse
come to eat, neither yesterday, nor today?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,28);</script>Jonathan answered
Saul, “David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,29);</script>He said, ‘Please let me go,
for our family has a sacrifice in the city. My brother has commanded me to
be there. Now, if I have found favor in your eyes, please let me go away
and see my brothers.’ Therefore he has not come to the king’s table.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,30);</script>Then Saul’s anger
was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, “You son of a perverse
rebellious woman, don’t I know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to
your own shame, and to the shame of your mother’s nakedness? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,31);</script>For as long as the son of Jesse
lives on the earth, you shall not be established, nor your kingdom.
Therefore now send and bring him to me, for he shall surely die!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,32);</script>Jonathan answered
Saul his father, and said to him, “Why should he be put to death? What
has he done?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,33);</script>Saul cast his spear
at him to strike him. By this Jonathan knew that his father was determined
to put David to death. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,34);</script>So Jonathan arose from the table
in fierce anger, and ate no food the second day of the month; for he was
grieved for David, because his father had done him shame. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,35);</script>It happened in the morning, that
Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a
little boy with him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,36);</script>He
said to his boy, “Run, find now the arrows which I shoot.” As the boy
ran, he shot an arrow beyond him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,37);</script>When the boy had come to the
place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the boy,
and said, “Isn’t the arrow beyond you?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,38);</script>Jonathan cried after the boy,
“Go fast! Hurry! Don’t delay!” Jonathan’s boy gathered up the
arrows, and came to his master. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,39);</script>But the boy didn’t know
anything. Only Jonathan and David knew the matter. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,40);</script>Jonathan gave his weapons to his
boy, and said to him, “Go, carry them to the city.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,41);</script>As soon as the boy
was gone, David arose out of the south, and fell on his face to the
ground, and bowed himself three times. They kissed one another, and wept
one with another, and David wept the most. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,42);</script>Jonathan said to David, “Go in
peace, because we have both sworn in the name of Yahweh, saying, ‘Yahweh
shall be between me and you, and between my seed and your seed,
forever.’” He arose and departed; and Jonathan went into the city.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,1);</script>Then came David to Nob
to Ahimelech the priest. Ahimelech came to meet David trembling, and said
to him, “Why are you alone, and no man with you?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,2);</script>David said to Ahimelech the
priest, “The king has commanded me a business, and has said to me,
‘Let no man know anything of the business about which I send you, and
what I have commanded you; and I have appointed the young men to such and
such a place.’ <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,3);</script>Now
therefore what is under your hand? Give me five loaves of bread in my
hand, or whatever there is present.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,4);</script>The priest answered
David, and said, “There is no common bread under my hand, but there is
holy bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,5);</script>David answered the
priest, and said to him, “Truly, women have been kept from us about
these three days. When I came out, the vessels of the young men were holy,
though it was but a common journey. How much more then today shall their
vessels be holy?” <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,6);</script>So
the priest gave him holy bread; for there was no bread there but the show
bread, that was taken from before Yahweh, to put hot bread in the day when
it was taken away.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,7);</script>Now a certain man of
the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before Yahweh; and his
name was Doeg the Edomite, the best of the herdsmen who belonged to Saul.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(21,8);</script>David said to Ahimelech,
“Isn’t there here under your hand spear or sword? For I have neither
brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king’s business
required haste.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,9);</script>The priest said,
“The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the valley of
Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you will
take that, take it; for there is no other except that here.”
<p>David said, “There is none like that. Give it to me.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,10);</script>David arose, and fled
that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,11);</script>The servants of Achish said to
him, “Isn’t this David the king of the land? Didn’t they sing one to
another about him in dances, saying, ‘Saul has slain his thousands,
David his ten thousands?’” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,12);</script>David laid up these words in his
heart, and was very afraid of Achish the king of Gath. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,13);</script>He changed his behavior before
them, and pretended to be mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors
of the gate, and let his spittle fall down on his beard. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,14);</script>Then Achish said to his
servants, “Look, you see the man is mad. Why then have you brought him
to me? <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,15);</script>Do I lack madmen,
that you have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence? Shall
this fellow come into my house?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,1);</script>David therefore
departed there, and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and
all his father’s house heard it, they went down there to him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,2);</script>Everyone who was in distress, and
everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was discontented, gathered
themselves to him; and he became captain over them: and there were with
him about four hundred men. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,3);</script>David went there to Mizpeh of
Moab, and he said to the king of Moab, “Please let my father and my
mother come out with you, until I know what God will do for me.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,4);</script>He brought them before the king
of Moab; and they lived with him all the while that David was in the
stronghold. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,5);</script>The prophet
Gad said to David, “Don’t stay in the stronghold. Depart, and go into
the land of Judah.”
<p>Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hereth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,6);</script>Saul heard that David was
discovered, and the men who were with him. Now Saul was sitting in Gibeah,
under the tamarisk tree in Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his
servants were standing about him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,7);</script>Saul said to his servants who
stood about him, “Hear now, you Benjamites! Will the son of Jesse give
everyone of you fields and vineyards, will he make you all captains of
thousands and captains of hundreds, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,8);</script>that all of you have conspired
against me, and there is none who discloses to me when my son makes a
treaty with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you who is sorry for
me, or discloses to me that my son has stirred up my servant against me,
to lie in wait, as at this day?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,9);</script>Then Doeg the Edomite,
who stood by the servants of Saul, answered and said, “I saw the son of
Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,10);</script>He inquired of Yahweh for him,
gave him food, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,11);</script>Then the king sent to
call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father’s
house, the priests who were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(22,12);</script>Saul said, “Hear now,
you son of Ahitub.”
<p>He answered, “Here I am, my lord.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,13);</script>Saul said to him,
“Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, in that
you have given him bread, and a sword, and have inquired of God for him,
that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,14);</script>Then Ahimelech
answered the king, and said, “Who among all your servants is so faithful
as David, who is the king’s son-in-law, and is taken into your council,
and is honorable in your house? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,15);</script>Have I today begun to inquire of
God for him? Be it far from me! Don’t let the king impute anything to
his servant, nor to all the house of my father; for your servant knows
nothing of all this, less or more.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,16);</script>The king said, “You
shall surely die, Ahimelech, you, and all your father’s house.”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(22,17);</script>The king said to the
guard who stood about him, “Turn, and kill the priests of Yahweh;
because their hand also is with David, and because they knew that he fled,
and didn’t disclose it to me.” But the servants of the king wouldn’t
put forth their hand to fall on the priests of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,18);</script>The king said to Doeg, “Turn
and attack the priests!”
<p>Doeg the Edomite turned, and he attacked the priests, and he killed on
that day eighty-five people who wore a linen ephod. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,19);</script>He struck Nob, the city of the
priests, with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and
nursing babies, and cattle and donkeys and sheep, with the edge of the
sword. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,20);</script>One of the sons
of Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after
David. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,21);</script>Abiathar told
David that Saul had slain Yahweh’s priests. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,22);</script>David said to Abiathar, “I
knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely
tell Saul. I am responsible for the death of all the persons of your
father’s house. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,23);</script>Stay
with me, don’t be afraid; for he who seeks my life seeks your life. For
with me you shall be in safeguard.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,1);</script>David was told,
“Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah, and are robbing
the threshing floors.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,2);</script>Therefore David
inquired of Yahweh, saying, “Shall I go and strike these Philistines?”
<p>Yahweh said to David, “Go strike the Philistines, and save Keilah.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,3);</script>David’s men said to
him, “Behold, we are afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we go
to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,4);</script>Then David inquired of
Yahweh yet again. Yahweh answered him, and said, “Arise, go down to
Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into your hand.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,5);</script>David and his men went
to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their
livestock, and killed them with a great slaughter. So David saved the
inhabitants of Keilah. <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,6);</script>It
happened, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that
he came down with an ephod in his hand.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,7);</script>It was told Saul that
David had come to Keilah. Saul said, “God has delivered him into my
hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that has gates and
bars.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,8);</script>Saul summoned
all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(23,9);</script>David knew that Saul was
devising mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest,
“Bring the ephod here.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,10);</script>Then David said, “O Yahweh,
the God of Israel, your servant has surely heard that Saul seeks to come
to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,11);</script>Will the men of Keilah deliver
me up into his hand? Will Saul come down, as your servant has heard?
Yahweh, the God of Israel, I beg you, tell your servant.”
<p>Yahweh said, “He will come down.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,12);</script>Then David said,
“Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul?”
<p>Yahweh said, “They will deliver you up.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,13);</script>Then David and his
men, who were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and
went wherever they could go. It was told Saul that David was escaped from
Keilah; and he gave up going there. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,14);</script>David stayed in the wilderness
in the strongholds, and remained in the hill country in the wilderness of
Ziph. Saul sought him every day, but God didn’t deliver him into his
hand. <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,15);</script>David saw that
Saul had come out to seek his life. David was in the wilderness of Ziph in
the wood.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,16);</script>Jonathan, Saul’s
son, arose, and went to David into the woods, and strengthened his hand in
God. <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,17);</script>He said to him,
“Don’t be afraid; for the hand of Saul my father shall not find you;
and you shall be king over Israel, and I shall be next to you; and that
also Saul my father knows.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,18);</script>They both made a covenant before
Yahweh: and David stayed in the woods, and Jonathan went to his house.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(23,19);</script>Then the Ziphites came
up to Saul to Gibeah, saying, “Doesn’t David hide himself with us in
the strongholds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the
south of the desert? <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,20);</script>Now
therefore, O king, come down, according to all the desire of your soul to
come down; and our part shall be to deliver him up into the king’s
hand.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,21);</script>Saul said, “You are
blessed by Yahweh; for you have had compassion on me. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,22);</script>Please go make yet more sure,
and know and see his place where his haunt is, and who has seen him there;
for it is told me that he deals very subtly. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,23);</script>See therefore, and take
knowledge of all the lurking places where he hides himself, and come again
to me with certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall happen, if he
is in the land, that I will search him out among all the thousands of
Judah.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,24);</script>They arose, and went
to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon,
in the Arabah on the south of the desert. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,25);</script>Saul and his men went to seek
him. When David was told, he went down to the rock, and stayed in the
wilderness of Maon. When Saul heard that, he pursued David in the
wilderness of Maon. <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,26);</script>Saul
went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of
the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul
and his men surrounded David and his men to take them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,27);</script>But a messenger came to Saul,
saying, “Hurry and come; for the Philistines have made a raid on the
land!” <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,28);</script>So Saul
returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines:
therefore they called that place Sela Hammahlekoth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,29);</script>David went up from there, and
lived in the strongholds of En Gedi.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,1);</script>It happened, when Saul
was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying,
“Behold, David is in the wilderness of En Gedi.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,2);</script>Then Saul took three thousand
chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men on the
rocks of the wild goats. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,3);</script>He came to the sheep pens by the
way, where there was a cave; and Saul went in to relieve himself. Now
David and his men were abiding in the innermost parts of the cave. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,4);</script>The men of David said to him,
“Behold, the day of which Yahweh said to you, ‘Behold, I will deliver
your enemy into your hand, and you shall do to him as it shall seem good
to you.’” Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul’s robe
secretly. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,5);</script>It happened
afterward, that David’s heart struck him, because he had cut off
Saul’s skirt. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,6);</script>He said
to his men, “Yahweh forbid that I should do this thing to my lord,
Yahweh’s anointed, to put forth my hand against him, since he is
Yahweh’s anointed.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,7);</script>So David checked his men with
these words, and didn’t allow them to rise against Saul. Saul rose up
out of the cave, and went on his way. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,8);</script>David also arose afterward, and
went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, “My lord the king!”
<p>When Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth,
and showed respect. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,9);</script>David
said to Saul, “Why do you listen to men’s words, saying, ‘Behold,
David seeks your hurt?’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,10);</script>Behold, this day your eyes have
seen how that Yahweh had delivered you today into my hand in the cave.
Some urged me to kill you; but I spared you; and I said, I will not put
forth my hand against my lord; for he is Yahweh’s anointed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,11);</script>Moreover, my father, behold,
yes, see the skirt of your robe in my hand; for in that I cut off the
skirt of your robe, and didn’t kill you, know and see that there is
neither evil nor disobedience in my hand, and I have not sinned against
you, though you hunt for my life to take it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,12);</script>May Yahweh judge between me and
you, and may Yahweh avenge me of you; but my hand shall not be on you.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(24,13);</script>As the proverb of the
ancients says, ‘Out of the wicked comes forth wickedness;’ but my hand
shall not be on you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,14);</script>Against whom has the king of
Israel come out? Whom do you pursue? A dead dog? A flea? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,15);</script>May Yahweh therefore be judge,
and give sentence between me and you, and see, and plead my cause, and
deliver me out of your hand.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,16);</script>It came to pass, when
David had made an end of speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said,
“Is this your voice, my son David?” Saul lifted up his voice, and
wept. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,17);</script>He said to David,
“You are more righteous than I; for you have done good to me, whereas I
have done evil to you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,18);</script>You have declared this day how
you have dealt well with me, because when Yahweh had delivered me up into
your hand, you didn’t kill me. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,19);</script>For if a man finds his enemy,
will he let him go away unharmed? Therefore may Yahweh reward you good for
that which you have done to me this day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,20);</script>Now, behold, I know that you
shall surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established
in your hand. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,21);</script>Swear now
therefore to me by Yahweh, that you will not cut off my seed after me, and
that you will not destroy my name out of my father’s house.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,22);</script>David swore to Saul.
Saul went home; but David and his men went up to the stronghold.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,1);</script>Samuel died; and all
Israel gathered themselves together, and lamented him, and buried him in
his house at Ramah. David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(25,2);</script>There was a man in Maon,
whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had
three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep
in Carmel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,3);</script>Now the name
of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail; and the woman was
of good understanding, and of a beautiful face: but the man was churlish
and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,4);</script>David heard in the wilderness
that Nabal was shearing his sheep. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,5);</script>David sent ten young men, and
David said to the young men, “Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and
greet him in my name. <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,6);</script>You
shall tell him, ‘Long life to you! Peace be to you, and peace be to your
house, and peace be to all that you have. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,7);</script>Now I have heard that you have
shearers. Your shepherds have now been with us, and we didn’t hurt them,
neither was there anything missing from them, all the while they were in
Carmel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,8);</script>Ask your young
men, and they will tell you. Therefore let the young men find favor in
your eyes; for we come in a good day. Please give whatever comes to your
hand, to your servants, and to your son David.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,9);</script>When David’s young
men came, they spoke to Nabal according to all those words in the name of
David, and ceased.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,10);</script>Nabal answered
David’s servants, and said, “Who is David? Who is the son of Jesse?
There are many servants who break away from their masters these days.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(25,11);</script>Shall I then take my
bread, and my water, and my meat that I have killed for my shearers, and
give it to men who I don’t know where they come from?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,12);</script>So David’s young
men turned on their way, and went back, and came and told him according to
all these words. <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,13);</script>David
said to his men, “Every man put on his sword!”
<p>Every man put on his sword. David also put on his sword. About four
hundred men followed David; and two hundred stayed by the baggage. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,14);</script>But one of the young men told
Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying, “Behold, David sent messengers out of
the wilderness to Greet our master; and he railed at them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,15);</script>But the men were very good to
us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we anything, as long as we went
with them, when we were in the fields. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,16);</script>They were a wall to us both by
night and by day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(25,17);</script>Now therefore know and
consider what you will do; for evil is determined against our master, and
against all his house; for he is such a worthless fellow that one can’t
speak to him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,18);</script>Then Abigail hurried
and took two hundred loaves of bread, two bottles of wine, five sheep
ready dressed, five measures of parched grain, one hundred clusters of
raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on donkeys. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,19);</script>She said to her young men, “Go
on before me. Behold, I come after you.” But she didn’t tell her
husband, Nabal. <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,20);</script>It was
so, as she rode on her donkey, and came down by the covert of the
mountain, that behold, David and his men came down toward her; and she met
them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,21);</script>Now David had said,
“Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow has in the wilderness,
so that nothing was missed of all that pertained to him. He has returned
me evil for good. <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,22);</script>God do
so to the enemies of David, and more also, if I leave of all that belongs
to him by the morning light so much as one <a href="#N9">who urinates on a
wall.</a>”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,23);</script>When Abigail saw
David, she hurried, and alighted from her donkey, and fell before David on
her face, and bowed herself to the ground. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,24);</script>She fell at his feet, and said,
“On me, my lord, on me be the iniquity; and please let your handmaid
speak in your ears. Hear the words of your handmaid. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,25);</script>Please don’t let my lord
regard this worthless fellow, even Nabal; for as his name is, so is he.
Nabal is his name, and folly is with him; but I, your handmaid, didn’t
see the young men of my lord, whom you sent. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,26);</script>Now therefore, my lord, as
Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, since Yahweh has withheld you from
blood guiltiness, and from avenging yourself with your own hand, now
therefore let your enemies, and those who seek evil to my lord, be as
Nabal. <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,27);</script>Now this present
which your servant has brought to my lord, let it be given to the young
men who follow my lord. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,28);</script>Please forgive the trespass of
your handmaid. For Yahweh will certainly make my lord a sure house,
because my lord fights the battles of Yahweh; and evil shall not be found
in you all your days. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,29);</script>Though men may rise up to pursue
you, and to seek your soul, yet the soul of my lord shall be bound in the
bundle of life with Yahweh your God. He will sling out the souls of your
enemies, as from the hollow of a sling. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,30);</script>It shall come to pass, when
Yahweh has done to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken
concerning you, and shall have appointed you prince over Israel, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,31);</script>that this shall be no grief to
you, nor offense of heart to my lord, either that you have shed blood
without cause, or that my lord has avenged himself. When Yahweh has dealt
well with my lord, then remember your handmaid.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,32);</script>David said to
Abigail, “Blessed is Yahweh, the God of Israel, who sent you this day to
meet me! <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,33);</script>Blessed is your
discretion, and blessed are you, that have kept me this day from blood
guiltiness, and from avenging myself with my own hand. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,34);</script>For indeed, as Yahweh, the God
of Israel, lives, who has withheld me from hurting you, unless you had
hurried and come to meet me, surely there wouldn’t have been left to
Nabal by the morning light so much as one <a href="#N10">who urinates on a
wall.</a>”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,35);</script>So David received of
her hand that which she had brought him: and he said to her, “Go up in
peace to your house. Behold, I have listened to your voice, and have
granted your request.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,36);</script>Abigail came to
Nabal; and behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king.
Nabal’s heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken. Therefore
she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,37);</script>It happened in the morning, when
the wine was gone out of Nabal, that his wife told him these things, and
his heart died within him, and he became as a stone. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,38);</script>It happened about ten days
after, that Yahweh struck Nabal, so that he died. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,39);</script>When David heard that Nabal was
dead, he said, “Blessed is Yahweh, who has pleaded the cause of my
reproach from the hand of Nabal, and has kept back his servant from evil.
Yahweh has returned the evildoing of Nabal on his own head.” David sent
and spoke concerning Abigail, to take her to him as wife. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,40);</script>When the servants of David had
come to Abigail to Carmel, they spoke to her, saying, “David has sent us
to you, to take you to him as wife.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,41);</script>She arose, and bowed
herself with her face to the earth, and said, “Behold, your handmaid is
a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,42);</script>Abigail hurried, and arose, and
rode on a donkey, with five ladies of hers who followed her; and she went
after the messengers of David, and became his wife. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,43);</script>David also took Ahinoam of
Jezreel; and they both became his wives. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,44);</script>Now Saul had given Michal his
daughter, David’s wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was of Gallim.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,1);</script>The Ziphites came to
Saul to Gibeah, saying, “Doesn’t David hide himself in the hill of
Hachilah, which is before the desert?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,2);</script>Then Saul arose, and went down to
the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with
him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,3);</script>Saul encamped in the hill of
Hachilah, which is before the desert, by the way. But David stayed in the
wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(26,4);</script>David therefore sent out
spies, and understood that Saul had certainly come. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,5);</script>David arose, and came to the
place where Saul had encamped; and David saw the place where Saul lay, and
Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his army: and Saul lay within the
place of the wagons, and the people were encamped around him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,6);</script>Then answered David and said to
Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab,
saying, “Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp?”
<p>Abishai said, “I will go down with you.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,7);</script>So David and Abishai came to the
people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the place of the
wagons, with his spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Abner and the
people lay around him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,8);</script>Then Abishai said to David,
“God has delivered up your enemy into your hand this day. Now therefore
please let me strike him with the spear to the earth at one stroke, and I
will not strike him the second time.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,9);</script>David said to Abishai,
“Don’t destroy him; for who can put forth his hand against Yahweh’s
anointed, and be guiltless?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,10);</script>David said, “As Yahweh lives,
Yahweh will strike him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall go down
into battle and perish. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,11);</script>Yahweh forbid that I should put
forth my hand against Yahweh’s anointed; but now please take the spear
that is at his head, and the jar of water, and let us go.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,12);</script>So David took the
spear and the jar of water from Saul’s head; and they went away: and no
man saw it, nor knew it, neither did any awake; for they were all asleep,
because a deep sleep from Yahweh was fallen on them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,13);</script>Then David went over to the
other side, and stood on the top of the mountain afar off; a great space
being between them; <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,14);</script>and
David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, “Don’t
you answer, Abner?”
<p>Then Abner answered, “Who are you who cries to the king?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,15);</script>David said to Abner,
“Aren’t you a man? Who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not
kept watch over your lord, the king? For one of the people came in to
destroy the king your lord. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,16);</script>This thing isn’t good that you
have done. As Yahweh lives, you are worthy to die, because you have not
kept watch over your lord, Yahweh’s anointed. Now see where the king’s
spear is, and the jar of water that was at his head.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,17);</script>Saul knew David’s
voice, and said, “Is this your voice, my son David?”
<p>David said, “It is my voice, my lord, O king.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,18);</script>He said, “Why does my lord
pursue after his servant? For what have I done? Or what evil is in my
hand? <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,19);</script>Now therefore,
please let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If it is so
that Yahweh has stirred you up against me, let him accept an offering. But
if it is the children of men, they are cursed before Yahweh; for they have
driven me out this day that I shouldn’t cling to Yahweh’s inheritance,
saying, ‘Go, serve other gods!’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,20);</script>Now therefore, don’t let my
blood fall to the earth away from the presence of Yahweh; for the king of
Israel has come out to seek a flea, as when one hunts a partridge in the
mountains.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,21);</script>Then Saul said, “I
have sinned. Return, my son David; for I will no more do you harm, because
my life was precious in your eyes this day. Behold, I have played the
fool, and have erred exceedingly.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,22);</script>David answered,
“Behold the spear, O king! Then let one of the young men come over and
get it. <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,23);</script>Yahweh will
render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; because Yahweh
delivered you into my hand today, and I wouldn’t put forth my hand
against Yahweh’s anointed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,24);</script>Behold, as your life was
respected this day in my eyes, so let my life be respected in the eyes of
Yahweh, and let him deliver me out of all oppression.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,25);</script>Then Saul said to
David, “You are blessed, my son David. You shall both do mightily, and
shall surely prevail.” So David went his way, and Saul returned to his
place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,1);</script>David said in his
heart, “I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul. There is nothing
better for me than that I should escape into the land of the Philistines;
and Saul will despair of me, to seek me any more in all the borders of
Israel. So shall I escape out of his hand.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,2);</script>David arose, and passed over, he
and the six hundred men who were with him, to Achish the son of Maoch,
king of Gath. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,3);</script>David lived
with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even
David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the
Carmelitess, Nabal’s wife. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,4);</script>It was told Saul that David was
fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,5);</script>David said to Achish, “If now I
have found favor in your eyes, let them give me a place in one of the
cities in the country, that I may dwell there. For why should your servant
dwell in the royal city with you?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,6);</script>Then Achish gave him Ziklag that
day: why Ziklag pertains to the kings of Judah to this day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,7);</script>The number of the days that David
lived in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(27,8);</script>David and his men went
up, and made a raid on the Geshurites, and the Girzites, and the
Amalekites; for those were the inhabitants of the land, who were of old,
as you go to Shur, even to the land of Egypt. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,9);</script>David struck the land, and saved
neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the cattle, and
the donkeys, and the camels, and the clothing; and he returned, and came
to Achish. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,10);</script>Achish said,
“Against whom have you made a raid today?”
<p>David said, “Against the South of Judah, against the South of the
Jerahmeelites, and against the South of the Kenites.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,11);</script>David saved neither man nor
woman alive, to bring them to Gath, saying, “Lest they should tell of
us, saying, ‘David this, and this has been his way all the time he has
lived in the country of the Philistines.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,12);</script>Achish believed
David, saying, “He has made his people Israel utterly to abhor him.
Therefore he shall be my servant forever.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,1);</script>It happened in those
days, that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare, to
fight with Israel. Achish said to David, “Know assuredly that you shall
go out with me in the army, you and your men.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,2);</script>David said to Achish,
“Therefore you shall know what your servant will do.”
<p>Achish said to David, “Therefore will I make you my bodyguard for
ever.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,3);</script>Now Samuel was dead,
and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own
city. Saul had put away those who had familiar spirits, and the wizards,
out of the land. <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,4);</script>The
Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and encamped in Shunem:
and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they encamped in Gilboa.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(28,5);</script>When Saul saw the army of
the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,6);</script>When Saul inquired of Yahweh,
Yahweh didn’t answer him, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by
prophets. <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,7);</script>Then Saul said
to his servants, “Seek me a woman who has a familiar spirit, that I may
go to her, and inquire of her.”
<p>His servants said to him, “Behold, there is a woman who has a
familiar spirit at Endor.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,8);</script>Saul disguised
himself, and put on other clothing, and went, he and two men with him, and
they came to the woman by night: and he said, “Please divine to me by
the familiar spirit, and bring me up whomever I shall name to you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,9);</script>The woman said to him,
“Behold, you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off those who have
familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land. Why then do you lay a
snare for my life, to cause me to die?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,10);</script>Saul swore to her by
Yahweh, saying, “As Yahweh lives, no punishment shall happen to you for
this thing.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,11);</script>Then the woman said,
“Whom shall I bring up to you?”
<p>He said, “Bring Samuel up for me.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,12);</script>When the woman saw
Samuel, she cried with a loud voice; and the woman spoke to Saul, saying,
“Why have you deceived me? For you are Saul!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,13);</script>The king said to her,
“Don’t be afraid. For what do you see?”
<p>The woman said to Saul, “I see a god coming up out of the earth.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,14);</script>He said to her,
“What does he look like?”
<p>She said, “An old man comes up. He is covered with a robe.” Saul
perceived that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground,
and showed respect.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,15);</script>Samuel said to Saul,
“Why have you disturbed me, to bring me up?”
<p>Saul answered, “I am very distressed; for the Philistines make war
against me, and God has departed from me, and answers me no more, neither
by prophets, nor by dreams. Therefore I have called you, that you may make
known to me what I shall do.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,16);</script>Samuel said, “Why
then do you ask of me, since Yahweh has departed from you and has become
your adversary? <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,17);</script>Yahweh
has done to you as he spoke by me. Yahweh has torn the kingdom out of your
hand, and given it to your neighbor, even to David. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,18);</script>Because you didn’t obey the
voice of Yahweh, and didn’t execute his fierce wrath on Amalek,
therefore Yahweh has done this thing to you this day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,19);</script>Moreover Yahweh will deliver
Israel also with you into the hand of the Philistines; and tomorrow you
and your sons will be with me. Yahweh will deliver the army of Israel also
into the hand of the Philistines.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,20);</script>Then Saul fell
immediately his full length on the earth, and was terrified, because of
the words of Samuel. There was no strength in him; for he had eaten no
bread all the day, nor all the night. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,21);</script>The woman came to Saul, and saw
that he was very troubled, and said to him, “Behold, your handmaid has
listened to your voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have
listened to your words which you spoke to me. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,22);</script>Now therefore, please listen
also to the voice of your handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread
before you; and eat, that you may have strength, when you go on your
way.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,23);</script>But he refused, and
said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman,
constrained him; and he listened to their voice. So he arose from the
earth, and sat on the bed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,24);</script>The woman had a fattened calf in
the house. She hurried and killed it; and she took flour, and kneaded it,
and baked unleavened bread of it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,25);</script>She brought it before Saul, and
before his servants; and they ate. Then they rose up, and went away that
night.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,1);</script>Now the Philistines
gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites encamped
by the spring which is in Jezreel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,2);</script>The lords of the Philistines
passed on by hundreds, and by thousands; and David and his men passed on
in the rear with Achish. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,3);</script>Then the princes of the
Philistines said, “What about these Hebrews?”
<p>Achish said to the princes of the Philistines, “Isn’t this David,
the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who has been with me these days,
or rather these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell away
to this day?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,4);</script>But the princes of the
Philistines were angry with him; and the princes of the Philistines said
to him, “Make the man return, that he may go back to his place where you
have appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the
battle he become an adversary to us. For with what should this fellow
reconcile himself to his lord? Should it not be with the heads of these
men? <script type="text/javascript">cb(29,5);</script>Is not this David,
of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, ‘Saul has slain his
thousands, David his ten thousands?’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,6);</script>Then Achish called
David, and said to him, “As Yahweh lives, you have been upright, and
your going out and your coming in with me in the army is good in my sight;
for I have not found evil in you since the day of your coming to me to
this day. Nevertheless, the lords don’t favor you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,7);</script>Therefore now return, and go in
peace, that you not displease the lords of the Philistines.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,8);</script>David said to Achish,
“But what have I done? What have you found in your servant so long as I
have been before you to this day, that I may not go and fight against the
enemies of my lord the king?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,9);</script>Achish answered David,
“I know that you are good in my sight, as an angel of God.
Notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, ‘He shall not
go up with us to the battle.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,10);</script>Therefore now rise up early in
the morning with the servants of your lord who have come with you; and as
soon as you are up early in the morning, and have light, depart.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,11);</script>So David rose up
early, he and his men, to depart in the morning, to return into the land
of the Philistines. The Philistines went up to Jezreel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,1);</script>It happened, when
David and his men had come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites
had made a raid on the South, and on Ziklag, and had struck Ziklag, and
burned it with fire, <script type="text/javascript">cb(30,2);</script>and
had taken captive the women and all who were therein, both small and
great. They didn’t kill any, but carried them off, and went their way.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(30,3);</script>When David and his men
came to the city, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and
their sons, and their daughters, were taken captive. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,4);</script>Then David and the people who
were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power
to weep. <script type="text/javascript">cb(30,5);</script>David’s two
wives were taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife
of Nabal the Carmelite. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,6);</script>David was greatly distressed; for
the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was
grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David
strengthened himself in Yahweh his God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,7);</script>David said to Abiathar the
priest, the son of Ahimelech, “Please bring me here the ephod.”
<p>Abiathar brought the ephod to David. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,8);</script>David inquired of Yahweh, saying,
“If I pursue after this troop, shall I overtake them?”
<p>He answered him, “Pursue; for you shall surely overtake them, and
shall without fail recover all.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,9);</script>So David went, he and
the six hundred men who were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where
those who were left behind stayed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,10);</script>But David pursued, he and four
hundred men; for two hundred stayed behind, who were so faint that they
couldn’t go over the brook Besor. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,11);</script>They found an Egyptian in the
field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he ate; and they
gave him water to drink. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,12);</script>They gave him a piece of a cake
of figs, and two clusters of raisins. when he had eaten, his spirit came
again to him; for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days
and three nights. <script type="text/javascript">cb(30,13);</script>David
asked him, “To whom do you belong? Where are you from?”
<p>He said, “I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my
master left me, because three days ago I fell sick. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,14);</script>We made a raid on the South of
the Cherethites, and on that which belongs to Judah, and on the South of
Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,15);</script>David said to him,
“Will you bring me down to this troop?”
<p>He said, “Swear to me by God that you will neither kill me, nor
deliver me up into the hands of my master, and I will bring you down to
this troop.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,16);</script>When he had brought
him down, behold, they were spread around over all the ground, eating,
drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken
out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,17);</script>David struck them from the
twilight even to the evening of the next day. Not a man of them escaped
from there, except four hundred young men, who rode on camels and fled.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(30,18);</script>David recovered all that
the Amalekites had taken; and David rescued his two wives. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,19);</script>There was nothing lacking to
them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil,
nor anything that they had taken to them. David brought back all. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,20);</script>David took all the flocks and
the herds, which they drove before those other livestock, and said,
“This is David’s spoil.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,21);</script>David came to the two
hundred men, who were so faint that they could not follow David, whom also
they had made to stay at the brook Besor; and they went forth to meet
David, and to meet the people who were with him. When David came near to
the people, he greeted them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,22);</script>Then all the wicked men and base
fellows, of those who went with David, answered and said, “Because they
didn’t go with us, we will not give them anything of the spoil that we
have recovered, except to every man his wife and his children, that he may
lead them away, and depart.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,23);</script>Then David said,
“You shall not do so, my brothers, with that which Yahweh has given to
us, who has preserved us, and delivered the troop that came against us
into our hand. <script type="text/javascript">cb(30,24);</script>Who will
listen to you in this matter? For as his share is who goes down to the
battle, so shall his share be who tarries by the baggage: they shall share
alike.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(30,25);</script>It was so from
that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to
this day. <script type="text/javascript">cb(30,26);</script>When David
came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil to the elders of Judah, even to his
friends, saying, “Behold, a present for you of the spoil of the enemies
of Yahweh.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(30,27);</script>He sent it
to those who were in Bethel, and to those who were in Ramoth of the South,
and to those who were in Jattir, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,28);</script>and to those who were in Aroer,
and to those who were in Siphmoth, and to those who were in Eshtemoa,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(30,29);</script>and to those who were in
Racal, and to those who were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to
those who were in the cities of the Kenites, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,30);</script>and to those who were in Hormah,
and to those who were in Borashan, and to those who were in Athach,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(30,31);</script>and to those who were in
Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men used to stay.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,1);</script>Now the Philistines
fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the
Philistines, and fell down slain on Mount Gilboa. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,2);</script>The Philistines followed hard on
Saul and on his sons; and the Philistines killed Jonathan, and Abinadab,
and Malchishua, the sons of Saul. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,3);</script>The battle went hard against
Saul, and the archers overtook him; and he was greatly distressed by
reason of the archers. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,4);</script>Then Saul said to his armor
bearer, “Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these
uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me!” But his armor
bearer would not; for he was terrified. Therefore Saul took his sword, and
fell on it. <script type="text/javascript">cb(31,5);</script>When his
armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell on his sword, and
died with him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(31,6);</script>So Saul
died, and his three sons, and his armor bearer, and all his men, that same
day together. <script type="text/javascript">cb(31,7);</script>When the
men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley, and those who were
beyond the Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his
sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines
came and lived in them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,8);</script>It happened on the next day, when
the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his
three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,9);</script>They cut off his head, and
stripped off his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines all
around, to carry the news to the house of their idols, and to the people.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(31,10);</script>They put his armor in
the house of the Ashtaroth; and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth
Shan. <script type="text/javascript">cb(31,11);</script>When the
inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead heard concerning him that which the
Philistines had done to Saul, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,12);</script>all the valiant men arose, and
went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from
the wall of Beth Shan; and they came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(31,13);</script>They took their bones,
and buried them under the tamarisk tree in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
