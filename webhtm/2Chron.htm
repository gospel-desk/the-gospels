The Second Book of Chronicles
</h1><p>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,1);</script>Solomon the son of David
was strengthened in his kingdom, and <a href="#N1">Yahweh</a> his <a
href="#N2">God</a> was with him, and magnified him exceedingly. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,2);</script>Solomon spoke to all Israel, to
the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every
prince in all Israel, the heads of the fathers’ households. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,3);</script>So Solomon, and all the assembly
with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the
Tent of Meeting of God, which Moses the servant of Yahweh had made in the
wilderness. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,4);</script>But David had
brought the ark of God up from Kiriath Jearim to the place that David had
prepared for it; for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,5);</script>Moreover the bronze altar, that
Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, was there before the
tabernacle of Yahweh: and Solomon and the assembly were seeking counsel
there. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,6);</script>Solomon went up
there to the bronze altar before Yahweh, which was at the Tent of Meeting,
and offered one thousand burnt offerings on it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,7);</script>In that night God appeared to
Solomon, and said to him, “Ask what I shall give you.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,8);</script>Solomon said to God, “You have
shown great loving kindness to David my father, and have made me king in
his place. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,9);</script>Now, Yahweh
God, let your promise to David my father be established; for you have made
me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,10);</script>Now give me wisdom and knowledge,
that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this
your people, that is so great?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,11);</script>God said to Solomon,
“Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked riches, wealth,
or honor, nor the life of those who hate you, neither yet have asked long
life; but have asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself, that you may judge
my people, over whom I have made you king: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,12);</script>wisdom and knowledge is granted
to you. I will give you riches, wealth, and honor, such as none of the
kings have had who have been before you; neither shall there any after you
have the like.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,13);</script>So Solomon came from
the high place that was at Gibeon, from before the Tent of Meeting, to
Jerusalem; and he reigned over Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,14);</script>Solomon gathered chariots and
horsemen: and he had one thousand four hundred chariots, and twelve
thousand horsemen, that he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king
at Jerusalem. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,15);</script>The king
made silver and gold to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to
be as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland, for abundance. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,16);</script>The horses which Solomon had were
brought out of Egypt and from Kue; the king’s merchants purchased them
from Kue. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,17);</script>They brought up
and brought out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred pieces of silver, and a
horse for one hundred fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and
the kings of Syria, they brought them out by their means.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,1);</script>Now Solomon purposed to
build a house for the name of Yahweh, and a house for his kingdom. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,2);</script>Solomon counted out seventy
thousand men to bear burdens, and eighty thousand men who were stone
cutters in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee
them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,3);</script>Solomon sent to
Huram the king of Tyre, saying, “As you dealt with David my father, and
sent him cedars to build him a house in which to dwell, so deal with me.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,4);</script>Behold, I am about to
build a house for the name of Yahweh my God, to dedicate it to him, and to
burn before him incense of sweet spices, and for the continual show bread,
and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the Sabbaths, and on
the new moons, and on the set feasts of Yahweh our God. This is an
ordinance forever to Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,5);</script>“The house which I
build is great; for our God is great above all gods. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,6);</script>But who is able to build him a
house, since heaven and the heaven of heavens can’t contain him? who am
I then, that I should build him a house, except just to burn incense
before him?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,7);</script>“Now therefore send
me a man skillful to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in
iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and who knows how to engrave
engravings, to be with the skillful men who are with me in Judah and in
Jerusalem, whom David my father provided.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,8);</script>“Send me also cedar
trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon; for I know that your
servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon: and behold, my servants shall
be with your servants, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,9);</script>even to prepare me timber in
abundance; for the house which I am about to build shall be great and
wonderful. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,10);</script>Behold, I will
give to your servants, the cutters who cut timber, twenty thousand
measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and
twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,11);</script>Then Huram the king of
Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, “Because Yahweh
loves his people, he has made you king over them.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,12);</script>Huram continued, “Blessed be
Yahweh, the God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who has given to
David the king a wise son, endowed with discretion and understanding, that
should build a house for Yahweh, and a house for his kingdom. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,13);</script>Now I have sent a skillful man,
endowed with understanding, of Huram my father’s, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,14);</script>the son of a woman of the
daughters of Dan; and his father was a man of Tyre, skillful to work in
gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in
purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson, also to engrave any
kind of engraving, and to devise any device; that there may be a place
appointed to him with your skillful men, and with the skillful men of my
lord David your father.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,15);</script>“Now therefore the
wheat and the barley, the oil and the wine, which my lord has spoken of,
let him send to his servants: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,16);</script>and we will cut wood out of
Lebanon, as much as you shall need; and we will bring it to you in floats
by sea to Joppa; and you shall carry it up to Jerusalem.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,17);</script>Solomon numbered all the
foreigners who were in the land of Israel, after the numbering with which
David his father had numbered them; and they were found one hundred
fifty-three thousand six hundred. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,18);</script>He set seventy thousand of them
to bear burdens, and eighty thousand who were stone cutters in the
mountains, and three thousand six hundred overseers to set the people at
work.
<p> <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,1);</script>Then Solomon began to
build the house of Yahweh at Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where Yahweh
appeared to David his father, which he prepared in the place that David
had appointed, in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,2);</script>He began to build in the second
day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,3);</script>Now these are the foundations
which Solomon laid for the building of God’s house. The length by cubits
after the first measure was sixty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,4);</script>The porch that was in
front, its length, according to the breadth of the house, was twenty
cubits, and the height one hundred twenty; and he overlaid it within with
pure gold. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,5);</script>The greater
house he made a ceiling with fir wood, which he overlaid with fine gold,
and ornamented it with palm trees and chains. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,6);</script>He garnished the house with
precious stones for beauty: and the gold was gold of Parvaim. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,7);</script>He overlaid also the house, the
beams, the thresholds, and its walls, and its doors, with gold; and
engraved cherubim on the walls. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,8);</script>He made the most holy house: its
length, according to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and its
breadth twenty cubits; and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six
hundred talents. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,9);</script>The
weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. He overlaid the upper rooms
with gold. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,10);</script>In the most
holy house he made two cherubim of image work; and they overlaid them with
gold. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,11);</script>The wings of the
cherubim were twenty cubits long: the wing of the one was five cubits,
reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was five cubits,
reaching to the wing of the other cherub. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,12);</script>The wing of the other cherub was
five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was
five cubits, joining to the wing of the other cherub. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,13);</script>The wings of these cherubim
spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and
their faces were toward the house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,14);</script>He made the veil of blue, and
purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and ornamented it with cherubim.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,15);</script>Also he made before the
house two pillars of thirty-five cubits high, and the capital that was on
the top of each of them was five cubits. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,16);</script>He made chains in the oracle, and
put them on the tops of the pillars; and he made one hundred pomegranates,
and put them on the chains. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,17);</script>He set up the pillars before the
temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the
name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left
Boaz.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,1);</script>Then he made an altar
of brass, twenty cubits its length, and twenty cubits its breadth, and ten
cubits its height. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,2);</script>Also he
made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass; and
its height was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits encircled it.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,3);</script>Under it was the likeness
of oxen, which encircled it, for ten cubits, encircling the sea. The oxen
were in two rows, cast when it was cast. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,4);</script>It stood on twelve oxen, three
looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three
looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea
was set on them above, and all their hinder parts were inward. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,5);</script>It was a handbreadth thick; and
its brim was worked like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily: it
received and held three thousand baths. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,6);</script>He made also ten basins, and put
five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them; such things
as belonged to the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea was for
the priests to wash in. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,7);</script>He
made the ten lampstands of gold according to the ordinance concerning
them; and he set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on
the left. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,8);</script>He made also ten
tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on
the left. He made one hundred basins of gold. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,9);</script>Furthermore he made the court of
the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid
their doors with brass. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,10);</script>He set the sea on the right side
of the house eastward, toward the south. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,11);</script>Huram made the pots, and the
shovels, and the basins. So Huram made an end of doing the work that he
did for king Solomon in God’s house: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,12);</script>the two pillars, and the bowls,
and the two capitals which were on the top of the pillars, and the two
networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of
the pillars, <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,13);</script>and the four
hundred pomegranates for the two networks; two rows of pomegranates for
each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the
pillars. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,14);</script>He made also the
bases, and the basins made he on the bases; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,15);</script>one sea, and the twelve oxen
under it. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,16);</script>Huram his
father also made the pots, the shovels, the forks, and all its vessels for
king Solomon for the house of Yahweh of bright brass. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,17);</script>The king cast them in the plain
of the Jordan, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,18);</script>Thus Solomon made all these
vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be found
out. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,19);</script>Solomon made all the
vessels that were in God’s house, the golden altar also, and the tables
with the show bread on them; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,20);</script>and the lampstands with their
lamps, to burn according to the ordinance before the oracle, of pure gold;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,21);</script>and the flowers, and the
lamps, and the tongs, of gold, and that perfect gold; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,22);</script>and the snuffers, and the basins,
and the spoons, and the fire pans, of pure gold: and as for the entry of
the house, the inner doors of it for the most holy place, and the doors of
the main hall of the temple were of gold.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,1);</script>Thus all the work that
Solomon did for the house of Yahweh was finished. Solomon brought in the
things that David his father had dedicated, even the silver, and the gold,
and all the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of God.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(5,2);</script>Then Solomon assembled the
elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the
fathers’ households of the children of Israel, to Jerusalem, to bring up
the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of the city of David, which is Zion.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(5,3);</script>And all the men of Israel
assembled themselves to the king at the feast, which was in the seventh
month. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,4);</script>All the elders of
Israel came: and the Levites took up the ark; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,5);</script>and they brought up the ark, and
the Tent of Meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; these
the priests the Levites brought up. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,6);</script>King Solomon and all the
congregation of Israel, that were assembled to him, were before the ark,
sacrificing sheep and cattle, that could not be counted nor numbered for
multitude. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,7);</script>The priests
brought in the ark of the covenant of Yahweh to its place, into the oracle
of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the
cherubim. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,8);</script>For the cherubim
spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim
covered the ark and its poles above. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,9);</script>The poles were so long that the
ends of the poles were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were
not seen outside: and there it is to this day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,10);</script>There was nothing in the ark
except the two tables which Moses put at Horeb, when Yahweh made a
covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,11);</script>It happened, when the priests had
come out of the holy place, (for all the priests who were present had
sanctified themselves, and didn’t keep their divisions; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,12);</script>also the Levites who were the
singers, all of them, even Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and
their brothers, arrayed in fine linen, with cymbals and stringed
instruments and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them
one hundred twenty priests sounding with trumpets;) <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,13);</script>it happened, when the trumpeters
and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and
thanking Yahweh; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and
cymbals and instruments of music, and praised Yahweh, saying,
<dl>
<dt>“For he is good;
<dd>for his loving kindness endures forever!”
</dl><br>
that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of Yahweh,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(5,14);</script>so that the priests could
not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of Yahweh
filled God’s house.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,1);</script>Then Solomon said,
“Yahweh has said that he would dwell in the thick darkness. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,2);</script>But I have built you a house of
habitation, and a place for you to dwell in forever.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,3);</script>The king turned his
face, and blessed all the assembly of Israel: and all the assembly of
Israel stood. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,4);</script>He said,
“Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth to David
my father, and has with his hands fulfilled it, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,5);</script>‘Since the day that I brought
forth my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the
tribes of Israel to build a house in, that my name might be there; neither
chose I any man to be prince over my people Israel: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,6);</script>but I have chosen Jerusalem, that
my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people
Israel.’ <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,7);</script>Now it was in
the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Yahweh, the
God of Israel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,8);</script>But Yahweh
said to David my father, ‘Whereas it was in your heart to build a house
for my name, you did well that it was in your heart: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,9);</script>nevertheless you shall not build
the house; but your son who shall come forth out of your body, he shall
build the house for my name.’
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,10);</script>“Yahweh has
performed his word that he spoke; for I have risen up in the place of
David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Yahweh promised, and
have built the house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,11);</script>There I have set the ark, in
which is the covenant of Yahweh, which he made with the children of
Israel.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,12);</script>He stood before the
altar of Yahweh in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread
forth his hands <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,13);</script>(for
Solomon had made a bronze scaffold, five cubits long, and five cubits
broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court;
and on it he stood, and kneeled down on his knees before all the assembly
of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven;) <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,14);</script>and he said, “Yahweh, the God
of Israel, there is no God like you, in heaven, or on earth; you who keep
covenant and loving kindness with your servants, who walk before you with
all their heart; <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,15);</script>who have
kept with your servant David my father that which you promised him: yes,
you spoke with your mouth, and have fulfilled it with your hand, as it is
this day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,16);</script>“Now therefore,
Yahweh, the God of Israel, keep with your servant David my father that
which you have promised him, saying, ‘There shall not fail you a man in
my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only your children take heed
to their way, to walk in my law as you have walked before me.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,17);</script>Now therefore, Yahweh, the God of
Israel, let your word be verified, which you spoke to your servant David.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,18);</script>“But will God indeed
dwell with men on the earth? Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens
can’t contain you; how much less this house which I have built! <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,19);</script>Yet have respect for the prayer
of your servant, and to his supplication, Yahweh my God, to listen to the
cry and to the prayer which your servant prays before you; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,20);</script>that your eyes may be open toward
this house day and night, even toward the place where you have said that
you would put your name; to listen to the prayer which your servant shall
pray toward this place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,21);</script>Listen to the petitions of your
servant, and of your people Israel, when they shall pray toward this
place: yes, hear from your dwelling place, even from heaven; and when you
hear, forgive.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,22);</script>“If a man sin
against his neighbor, and an oath is laid on him to cause him to swear,
and he comes and swears before your altar in this house; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,23);</script>then hear from heaven, and do,
and judge your servants, bringing retribution to the wicked, to bring his
way on his own head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according
to his righteousness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,24);</script>“If your people
Israel be struck down before the enemy, because they have sinned against
you, and shall turn again and confess your name, and pray and make
supplication before you in this house; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,25);</script>then hear from heaven, and
forgive the sin of your people Israel, and bring them again to the land
which you gave to them and to their fathers.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,26);</script>“When the sky is
shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against you; if
they pray toward this place, and confess your name, and turn from their
sin, when you afflict them: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,27);</script>then hear in heaven, and forgive
the sin of your servants, and of your people Israel, when you teach them
the good way in which they should walk; and send rain on your land, which
you have given to your people for an inheritance.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,28);</script>“If there is famine
in the land, if there is pestilence, if there is blight or mildew, locust
or caterpillar; if their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities;
whatever plague or whatever sickness there is; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,29);</script>whatever prayer and supplication
be made by any man, or by all your people Israel, who shall know every man
his own plague and his own sorrow, and shall spread forth his hands toward
this house: <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,30);</script>then hear
from heaven, your dwelling place and forgive, and render to every man
according to all his ways, whose heart you know; (for you, even you only,
know the hearts of the children of men;) <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,31);</script>that they may fear you, to walk
in your ways, so long as they live in the land which you gave to our
fathers.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,32);</script>“Moreover concerning
the foreigner, who is not of your people Israel, when he shall come from a
far country for your great name’s sake, and your mighty hand, and your
outstretched arm; when they shall come and pray toward this house: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,33);</script>then hear from heaven, even from
your dwelling place, and do according to all that the foreigner calls to
you for; that all the peoples of the earth may know your name, and fear
you, as does your people Israel, and that they may know that this house
which I have built is called by your name.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,34);</script>“If your people go
out to battle against their enemies, by whatever way you shall send them,
and they pray to you toward this city which you have chosen, and the house
which I have built for your name; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,35);</script>then hear from heaven their
prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,36);</script>“If they sin against
you (for there is no man who doesn’t sin), and you are angry with them,
and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive to a
land far off or near; <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,37);</script>yet
if they shall repent themselves in the land where they are carried
captive, and turn again, and make supplication to you in the land of their
captivity, saying, ‘We have sinned, we have done perversely, and have
dealt wickedly;’ <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,38);</script>if
they return to you with all their heart and with all their soul in the
land of their captivity, where they have carried them captive, and pray
toward their land, which you gave to their fathers, and the city which you
have chosen, and toward the house which I have built for your name:
<script type="text/javascript">cb(6,39);</script>then hear from heaven,
even from your dwelling place, their prayer and their petitions, and
maintain their cause, and forgive your people who have sinned against you.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,40);</script>“Now, my God, let, I
beg you, your eyes be open, and let your ears be attentive, to the prayer
that is made in this place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,41);</script>“Now therefore
arise, Yahweh God, into your resting place, you, and the ark of your
strength: let your priests, Yahweh God, be clothed with salvation, and let
your saints rejoice in goodness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,42);</script>“Yahweh God, don’t
turn away the face of your anointed. Remember your loving kindnesses to
David your servant.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,1);</script>Now when Solomon had
made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the
burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of Yahweh filled the
house. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,2);</script>The priests could
not enter into the house of Yahweh, because the glory of Yahweh filled
Yahweh’s house. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,3);</script>All the
children of Israel looked on, when the fire came down, and the glory of
Yahweh was on the house; and they bowed themselves with their faces to the
ground on the pavement, and worshiped, and gave thanks to Yahweh, saying,
<dl>
<dt>“For he is good;
<dd>for his loving kindness endures for ever.”
</dl><br>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,4);</script>Then the king and all the
people offered sacrifice before Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,5);</script>King Solomon offered a sacrifice
of twenty-two thousand head of cattle, and a hundred and twenty thousand
sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated God’s house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,6);</script>The priests stood, according to
their positions; the Levites also with instruments of music of Yahweh,
which David the king had made to give thanks to Yahweh, when David praised
by their ministry, saying “For his loving kindness endures for ever.”
The priests sounded trumpets before them; and all Israel stood.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,7);</script>Moreover Solomon made
the middle of the court holy that was before the house of Yahweh; for
there he offered the burnt offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings,
because the bronze altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive
the burnt offering, and the meal offering, and the fat. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,8);</script>So Solomon held the feast at that
time seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly, from the
entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,9);</script>On the eighth day they held a
solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and
the feast seven days. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,10);</script>On
the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away
to their tents, joyful and glad of heart for the goodness that Yahweh had
shown to David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,11);</script>Thus Solomon finished the house
of Yahweh, and the king’s house: and he successfully completed all that
came into Solomon’s heart to make in the house of Yahweh, and in his own
house.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,12);</script>Yahweh appeared to
Solomon by night, and said to him, “I have heard your prayer, and have
chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,13);</script>“If I shut up the
sky so that there is no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the
land, or if I send pestilence among my people; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,14);</script>if my people, who are called by
my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn
from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive
their sin, and will heal their land. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,15);</script>Now my eyes shall be open, and my
ears attentive, to the prayer that is made in this place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,16);</script>For now have I chosen and made
this house holy, that my name may be there forever; and my eyes and my
heart shall be there perpetually.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,17);</script>“As for you, if you
will walk before me as David your father walked, and do according to all
that I have commanded you, and will keep my statutes and my ordinances;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,18);</script>then I will establish the
throne of your kingdom, according as I covenanted with David your father,
saying, ‘There shall not fail you a man to be ruler in Israel.’
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,19);</script>But if you turn away, and
forsake my statutes and my commandments which I have set before you, and
shall go and serve other gods, and worship them; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,20);</script>then I will pluck them up by the
roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have
made holy for my name, I will cast out of my sight, and I will make it a
proverb and a byword among all peoples. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,21);</script>This house, which is so high,
everyone who passes by it shall be astonished, and shall say, ‘Why has
Yahweh done thus to this land, and to this house?’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,22);</script>They shall answer, ‘Because
they abandoned Yahweh, the God of their fathers, who brought them forth
out of the land of Egypt, and took other gods, worshiped them, and served
them. Therefore he has brought all this evil on them.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,1);</script>It happened at the end
of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the house of Yahweh, and his
own house, <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,2);</script>that the cities
which Huram had given to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the
children of Israel to dwell there. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,3);</script>Solomon went to Hamath Zobah, and
prevailed against it. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,4);</script>He
built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the storage cities, which he built
in Hamath. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,5);</script>Also he built
Beth Horon the upper, and Beth Horon the lower, fortified cities, with
walls, gates, and bars; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,6);</script>and Baalath, and all the storage
cities that Solomon had, and all the cities for his chariots, and the
cities for his horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build for his
pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his
dominion. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,7);</script>As for all the
people who were left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the
Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of Israel;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,8);</script>of their children who were
left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel didn’t consume,
of them Solomon conscripted forced labor to this day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,9);</script>But of the children of Israel,
Solomon made no servants for his work; but they were men of war, and chief
of his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,10);</script>These were the chief officers of
king Solomon, even two-hundred fifty, who ruled over the people.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,11);</script>Solomon brought up the
daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David to the house that he had
built for her; for he said, “My wife shall not dwell in the house of
David king of Israel, because the places where the ark of Yahweh has come
are holy.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,12);</script>Then Solomon offered
burnt offerings to Yahweh on the altar of Yahweh, which he had built
before the porch, <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,13);</script>even as
the duty of every day required, offering according to the commandment of
Moses, on the Sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the set feasts, three
times in the year, in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of
weeks, and in the feast of tents. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,14);</script>He appointed, according to the
ordinance of David his father, the divisions of the priests to their
service, and the Levites to their offices, to praise, and to minister
before the priests, as the duty of every day required; the doorkeepers
also by their divisions at every gate: for so had David the man of God
commanded. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,15);</script>They didn’t
depart from the commandment of the king to the priests and Levites
concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,16);</script>Now all the work of Solomon was
prepared to the day of the foundation of the house of Yahweh, and until it
was finished. So the house of Yahweh was completed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,17);</script>Then went Solomon to Ezion Geber,
and to Eloth, on the seashore in the land of Edom. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,18);</script>Huram sent him ships and servants
who had knowledge of the sea by the hands of his servants; and they came
with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and fetched from there four hundred
fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,1);</script>When the queen of Sheba
heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard
questions at Jerusalem, with a very great train, and camels that bore
spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she had come
to Solomon, she talked with him of all that was in her heart. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,2);</script>Solomon told her all her
questions; and there was not anything hidden from Solomon which he
didn’t tell her. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,3);</script>When
the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he
had built, <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,4);</script>and the food of
his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his
ministers, and their clothing, his cup bearers also, and their clothing,
and his ascent by which he went up to the house of Yahweh; there was no
more spirit in her.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,5);</script>She said to the king,
“It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts, and of
your wisdom. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,6);</script>However I
didn’t believe their words, until I came, and my eyes had seen it; and
behold, the half of the greatness of your wisdom was not told me: you
exceed the fame that I heard. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,7);</script>Happy are your men, and happy are
these your servants, who stand continually before you, and hear your
wisdom. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,8);</script>Blessed be Yahweh
your God, who delighted in you, to set you on his throne, to be king for
Yahweh your God: because your God loved Israel, to establish them forever,
therefore made he you king over them, to do justice and righteousness.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,9);</script>She gave the king one
hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices in great abundance, and
precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba
gave to king Solomon. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,10);</script>The
servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, who brought gold from
Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,11);</script>The king made of the algum trees
terraces for the house of Yahweh, and for the king’s house, and harps
and stringed instruments for the singers: and there were none like these
seen before in the land of Judah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,12);</script>King Solomon gave to the queen of
Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, besides that which she had
brought to the king. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her
servants. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,13);</script>Now the weight
of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six
talents of gold, <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,14);</script>besides
that which the traders and merchants brought: and all the kings of Arabia
and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,15);</script>King Solomon made two
hundred bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred shekels of beaten gold went
to one buckler. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,16);</script>He made
three hundred shields of beaten gold; three hundred shekels of gold went
to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of
Lebanon. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,17);</script>Moreover the
king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,18);</script>And there were six steps to the
throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and
stays on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing
beside the stays. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,19);</script>Twelve
lions stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps: there
was nothing like it made in any kingdom. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,20);</script>All king Solomon’s drinking
vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of
Lebanon were of pure gold: silver was nothing accounted of in the days of
Solomon. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,21);</script>For the king had
ships that went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram; once every three
years came the ships of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and
apes, and peacocks. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,22);</script>So
king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,23);</script>All the kings of the
earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had
put in his heart. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,24);</script>They
brought every man his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and
clothing, armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,25);</script>Solomon had four thousand
stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he
stationed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,26);</script>He ruled over all the kings from
the River even to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,27);</script>The king made silver to
be in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars to be as the sycamore trees
that are in the lowland, for abundance. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,28);</script>They brought horses for Solomon
out of Egypt, and out of all lands. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,29);</script>Now the rest of the acts of
Solomon, first and last, aren’t they written in the history of Nathan
the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the
visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,30);</script>Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over
all Israel forty years. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,31);</script>Solomon slept with his fathers,
and he was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son
reigned in his place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,1);</script>Rehoboam went to
Shechem; for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,2);</script>It happened, when Jeroboam the
son of Nebat heard of it, (for he was in Egypt, where he had fled from the
presence of king Solomon), that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,3);</script>They sent and called him; and
Jeroboam and all Israel came, and they spoke to Rehoboam, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,4);</script>“Your father made our yoke
grievous: now therefore make you the grievous service of your father, and
his heavy yoke which he put on us, lighter, and we will serve you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,5);</script>He said to them,
“Come again to me after three days.”
<p>The people departed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,6);</script>King Rehoboam took counsel with
the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived,
saying, “What counsel do you give me to return answer to this people?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,7);</script>They spoke to him,
saying, “If you are kind to this people, and please them, and speak good
words to them, then they will be your servants forever.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,8);</script>But he forsook the
counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the
young men who had grown up with him, who stood before him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,9);</script>He said to them, “What counsel
do you give, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to
me, saying, ‘Make the yoke that your father put on us lighter?’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,10);</script>The young men who had
grown up with him spoke to him, saying, “Thus you shall tell the people
who spoke to you, saying, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but make it
lighter on us;’ thus you shall say to them, ‘My little finger is
thicker than my father’s waist. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,11);</script>Now whereas my father burdened
you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father chastised you
with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,12);</script>So Jeroboam and all
the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king asked, saying,
“Come to me again the third day.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,13);</script>The king answered them roughly;
and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,14);</script>and spoke to them after the
counsel of the young men, saying, “My father made your yoke heavy, but I
will add to it. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise
you with scorpions.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,15);</script>So the king didn’t
listen to the people; for it was brought about of God, that Yahweh might
establish his word, which he spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the
son of Nebat. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,16);</script>When all
Israel saw that the king didn’t listen to them, the people answered the
king, saying, “What portion have we in David? Neither have we
inheritance in the son of Jesse! Every man to your tents, Israel! Now see
to your own house, David.” So all Israel departed to their tents.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,17);</script>But as for the
children of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over
them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,18);</script>Then king Rehoboam
sent Hadoram, who was over the men subject to forced labor; and the
children of Israel stoned him to death with stones. King Rehoboam made
speed to get himself up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,19);</script>So Israel rebelled against the
house of David to this day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,1);</script>When Rehoboam had come
to Jerusalem, he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, one hundred
eighty thousand chosen men, who were warriors, to fight against Israel, to
bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,2);</script>But the word of Yahweh came to
Shemaiah the man of God, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,3);</script>“Speak to Rehoboam the son of
Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,4);</script>‘Thus says Yahweh,
“You shall not go up, nor fight against your brothers! Return every man
to his house; for this thing is of me.”’” So they listened to the
words of Yahweh, and returned from going against Jeroboam. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,5);</script>Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem, and
built cities for defense in Judah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,6);</script>He built Bethlehem, and Etam, and
Tekoa, <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,7);</script>Beth Zur, and
Soco, and Adullam, <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,8);</script>and
Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,9);</script>and Adoraim, and Lachish, and
Azekah, <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,10);</script>and Zorah, and
Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin, fortified cities.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,11);</script>He fortified the
strongholds, and put captains in them, and stores of food, and oil and
wine. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,12);</script>He put shields and
spears in every city, and made them exceeding strong. Judah and Benjamin
belonged to him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,13);</script>The
priests and the Levites who were in all Israel resorted to him out of all
their border. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,14);</script>For the
Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and
Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons cast them off, that they should not
execute the priest’s office to Yahweh; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,15);</script>and he appointed him priests for
the high places, and for the male goats, and for the calves which he had
made. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,16);</script>After them, out of
all the tribes of Israel, such as set their hearts to seek Yahweh, the God
of Israel, came to Jerusalem to sacrifice to Yahweh, the God of their
fathers. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,17);</script>So they
strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon
strong, three years; for they walked three years in the way of David and
Solomon. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,18);</script>Rehoboam took
him a wife, Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, and of
Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,19);</script>and she bore him sons: Jeush,
and Shemariah, and Zaham. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,20);</script>After her he took Maacah the
daughter of Absalom; and she bore him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and
Shelomith. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,21);</script>Rehoboam
loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his
concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and sixty concubines, and became
the father of twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.) <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,22);</script>Rehoboam appointed Abijah the
son of Maacah to be chief, the prince among his brothers; for he intended
to make him king. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,23);</script>He
dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his sons throughout all the lands of
Judah and Benjamin, to every fortified city: and he gave them food in
abundance. He sought for them many wives.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,1);</script>It happened, when the
kingdom of Rehoboam was established, and he was strong, that he forsook
the law of Yahweh, and all Israel with him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,2);</script>It happened in the fifth year of
king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem,
because they had trespassed against Yahweh, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,3);</script>with twelve hundred chariots, and
sixty thousand horsemen. The people were without number who came with him
out of Egypt: the Lubim, the Sukkiim, and the Ethiopians. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,4);</script>He took the fortified cities
which pertained to Judah, and came to Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,5);</script>Now Shemaiah the prophet came to
Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, who were gathered together to
Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, “Thus says Yahweh,
‘You have forsaken me, therefore have I also left you in the hand of
Shishak.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,6);</script>Then the princes of
Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, “Yahweh is
righteous.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,7);</script>When Yahweh saw that
they humbled themselves, the word of Yahweh came to Shemaiah, saying,
“They have humbled themselves. I will not destroy them; but I will grant
them some deliverance, and my wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem
by the hand of Shishak. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,8);</script>Nevertheless they shall be his
servants, that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms
of the countries.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,9);</script>So Shishak king of
Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house
of Yahweh, and the treasures of the king’s house. He took it all away.
He also took away the shields of gold which Solomon had made. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,10);</script>King Rehoboam made in their
place shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the captains of
the guard, who kept the door of the king’s house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,11);</script>It was so, that as often as the
king entered into the house of Yahweh, the guard came and bore them, and
brought them back into the guard room. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,12);</script>When he humbled himself, the
wrath of Yahweh turned from him, so as not to destroy him altogether: and
moreover in Judah there were good things found. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,13);</script>So king Rehoboam strengthened
himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was forty-one years old
when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the
city which Yahweh had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his
name there: and his mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,14);</script>He did that which was evil,
because he didn’t set his heart to seek Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,15);</script>Now the acts of Rehoboam, first
and last, aren’t they written in the histories of Shemaiah the prophet
and of Iddo the seer, after the way of genealogies? There were wars
between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,16);</script>Rehoboam slept with his fathers,
and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his
place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,1);</script>In the eighteenth year
of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,2);</script>He reigned three years in
Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of
Gibeah. There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,3);</script>Abijah joined battle with an army
of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: and Jeroboam
set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen
men, who were mighty men of valor. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,4);</script>Abijah stood up on Mount
Zemaraim, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, and said, “Hear me,
Jeroboam and all Israel: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,5);</script>Ought you not to know that
Yahweh, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David forever,
even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,6);</script>Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up, and rebelled against his
lord. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,7);</script>There were gathered
to him worthless men, base fellows, who strengthened themselves against
Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted,
and could not withstand them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,8);</script>“Now you think to
withstand the kingdom of Yahweh in the hand of the sons of David; and you
are a great multitude, and there are with you the golden calves which
Jeroboam made you for gods. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,9);</script>Haven’t you driven out the
priests of Yahweh, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made priests
for yourselves after the ways of the peoples of other lands? so that
whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams, the
same may be a priest of those who are no gods.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,10);</script>“But as for us,
Yahweh is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and we have priests
ministering to Yahweh, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in their work:
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,11);</script>and they burn to Yahweh
every morning and every evening burnt offerings and sweet incense. They
also set the show bread in order on the pure table; and the lampstand of
gold with its lamps, to burn every evening: for we keep the instruction of
Yahweh our God; but you have forsaken him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,12);</script>Behold, God is with us at our
head, and his priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against
you. Children of Israel, don’t fight against Yahweh, the God of your
fathers; for you shall not prosper.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,13);</script>But Jeroboam caused
an ambush to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the
ambush was behind them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,14);</script>When Judah looked back, behold,
the battle was before and behind them; and they cried to Yahweh, and the
priests sounded with the trumpets. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,15);</script>Then the men of Judah gave a
shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it happened, that God struck
Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,16);</script>The children of Israel fled
before Judah; and God delivered them into their hand. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,17);</script>Abijah and his people killed
them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five
hundred thousand chosen men. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,18);</script>Thus the children of Israel were
brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because
they relied on Yahweh, the God of their fathers. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,19);</script>Abijah pursued after Jeroboam,
and took cities from him, Bethel with its towns, and Jeshanah with its
towns, and Ephron with its towns. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,20);</script>Jeroboam didn’t recover
strength again in the days of Abijah. Yahweh struck him, and he died.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,21);</script>But Abijah grew mighty,
and took to himself fourteen wives, and became the father of twenty-two
sons, and sixteen daughters. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,22);</script>The rest of the acts of Abijah,
and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the commentary of the
prophet Iddo.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,1);</script>So Abijah slept with
his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David; and Asa his son
reigned in his place. In his days the land was quiet ten years. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,2);</script>Asa did that which was good and
right in the eyes of Yahweh his God: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,3);</script>for he took away the foreign
altars, and the high places, and broke down the pillars, and cut down the
Asherim, <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,4);</script>and commanded
Judah to seek Yahweh, the God of their fathers, and to do the law and the
commandment. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,5);</script>Also he took
away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun images:
and the kingdom was quiet before him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,6);</script>He built fortified cities in
Judah; for the land was quiet, and he had no war in those years, because
Yahweh had given him rest. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,7);</script>For he said to Judah, “Let us
build these cities, and make walls around them, with towers, gates, and
bars. The land is yet before us, because we have sought Yahweh our God; we
have sought him, and he has given us rest on every side.” So they built
and prospered. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,8);</script>Asa had an
army that bore bucklers and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand;
and out of Benjamin, that bore shields and drew bows, two hundred eighty
thousand: all these were mighty men of valor. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,9);</script>There came out against them Zerah
the Ethiopian with an army of a million troops, and three hundred
chariots; and he came to Mareshah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,10);</script>Then Asa went out to meet him,
and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(14,11);</script>Asa cried to Yahweh his
God, and said, “Yahweh, there is none besides you to help, between the
mighty and him who has no strength. Help us, Yahweh our God; for we rely
on you, and in your name are we come against this multitude. Yahweh, you
are our God. Don’t let man prevail against you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,12);</script>So Yahweh struck the
Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,13);</script>Asa and the people who were with
him pursued them to Gerar: and there fell of the Ethiopians so many that
they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before Yahweh,
and before his army; and they carried away very much booty. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,14);</script>They struck all the cities
around Gerar; for the fear of Yahweh came on them: and they despoiled all
the cities; for there was much spoil in them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,15);</script>They struck also the tents of
livestock, and carried away sheep in abundance, and camels, and returned
to Jerusalem.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,1);</script>The Spirit of God came
on Azariah the son of Oded: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,2);</script>and he went out to meet Asa, and
said to him, “Hear me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin! Yahweh is with
you, while you are with him; and if you seek him, he will be found by you;
but if you forsake him, he will forsake you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,3);</script>Now for a long time Israel was
without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(15,4);</script>But when in their
distress they turned to Yahweh, the God of Israel, and sought him, he was
found by them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,5);</script>In those
times there was no peace to him who went out, nor to him who came in; but
great troubles were on all the inhabitants of the lands. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,6);</script>They were broken in pieces,
nation against nation, and city against city; for God troubled them with
all adversity. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,7);</script>But you be
strong, and don’t let your hands be slack; for your work shall be
rewarded.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,8);</script>When Asa heard these
words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away
the abominations out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the
cities which he had taken from the hill country of Ephraim; and he renewed
the altar of Yahweh, that was before the porch of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,9);</script>He gathered all Judah and
Benjamin, and those who lived with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and
out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they
saw that Yahweh his God was with him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,10);</script>So they gathered themselves
together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the
reign of Asa. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,11);</script>They
sacrificed to Yahweh in that day, of the spoil which they had brought,
seven hundred head of cattle and seven thousand sheep. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,12);</script>They entered into the covenant
to seek Yahweh, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and with
all their soul; <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,13);</script>and that
whoever would not seek Yahweh, the God of Israel, should be put to death,
whether small or great, whether man or woman. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,14);</script>They swore to Yahweh with a loud
voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,15);</script>All Judah rejoiced at the oath;
for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole
desire; and he was found of them: and Yahweh gave them rest all around.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(15,16);</script>Also Maacah, the mother
of Asa the king, he removed from being queen, because she had made an
abominable image for an Asherah; and Asa cut down her image, and made dust
of it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,17);</script>But the high places were not
taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all
his days. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,18);</script>He brought
into God’s house the things that his father had dedicated, and that he
himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,19);</script>There was no more war to the
five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,1);</script>In the six and
thirtieth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha king of Israel went up against
Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not allow anyone to go out or come
in to Asa king of Judah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,2);</script>Then Asa brought out silver and
gold out of the treasures of the house of Yahweh and of the king’s
house, and sent to Ben Hadad king of Syria, who lived at Damascus, saying,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(16,3);</script>“Let there be a treaty
between me and you, as there was between my father and your father.
Behold, I have sent you silver and gold. Go, break your treaty with Baasha
king of Israel, that he may depart from me.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,4);</script>Ben Hadad listened to
king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of
Israel; and they struck Ijon, and Dan, and Abel Maim, and all the storage
cities of Naphtali. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,5);</script>It
happened, when Baasha heard of it, that he left off building Ramah, and
let his work cease. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,6);</script>Then
Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah,
and its timber, with which Baasha had built; and he built therewith Geba
and Mizpah. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,7);</script>At that time
Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to him, “Because you
have relied on the king of Syria, and have not relied on Yahweh your God,
therefore is the army of the king of Syria escaped out of your hand.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(16,8);</script>Weren’t the Ethiopians
and the Lubim a huge army, with chariots and horsemen exceeding many? Yet,
because you relied on Yahweh, he delivered them into your hand. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,9);</script>For the eyes of Yahweh run back
and forth throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf
of them whose heart is perfect toward him. Herein you have done foolishly;
for from henceforth you shall have wars.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,10);</script>Then Asa was angry
with the seer, and put him in the prison; for he was in a rage with him
because of this thing. Asa oppressed some of the people at the same time.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(16,11);</script>Behold, the acts of Asa,
first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah
and Israel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,12);</script>In the
thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa was diseased in his feet; his disease
was exceeding great: yet in his disease he didn’t seek Yahweh, but to
the physicians. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,13);</script>Asa
slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his
reign. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,14);</script>They buried him
in his own tombs, which he had dug out for himself in the city of David,
and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odors and various
kinds of spices prepared by the perfumers’ art: and they made a very
great burning for him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,1);</script>Jehoshaphat his son
reigned in his place, and strengthened himself against Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,2);</script>He placed forces in all the
fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in
the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,3);</script>Yahweh was with Jehoshaphat,
because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and didn’t seek
the Baals, <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,4);</script>but sought to
the God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the
doings of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,5);</script>Therefore Yahweh established the
kingdom in his hand; and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat tribute; and he
had riches and honor in abundance. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,6);</script>His heart was lifted up in the
ways of Yahweh: and furthermore he took away the high places and the
Asherim out of Judah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,7);</script>Also in the third year of his
reign he sent his princes, even Ben Hail, and Obadiah, and Zechariah, and
Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,8);</script>and with them the Levites, even
Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and
Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, the Levites; and
with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,9);</script>They taught in Judah, having the
book of the law of Yahweh with them; and they went about throughout all
the cities of Judah, and taught among the people. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,10);</script>The fear of Yahweh fell on all
the kingdoms of the lands that were around Judah, so that they made no war
against Jehoshaphat. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,11);</script>Some of the Philistines brought
Jehoshaphat presents, and silver for tribute; the Arabians also brought
him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and
seven hundred male goats. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,12);</script>Jehoshaphat grew great
exceedingly; and he built in Judah castles and cities of store. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,13);</script>He had many works in the cities
of Judah; and men of war, mighty men of valor, in Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,14);</script>This was the numbering of them
according to their fathers’ houses: Of Judah, the captains of thousands:
Adnah the captain, and with him mighty men of valor three hundred
thousand; <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,15);</script>and next to
him Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred eighty thousand;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(17,16);</script>and next to him Amasiah
the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself to Yahweh; and with him
two hundred thousand mighty men of valor. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,17);</script>Of Benjamin: Eliada a mighty man
of valor, and with him two hundred thousand armed with bow and shield;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(17,18);</script>and next to him
Jehozabad and with him one hundred eighty thousand ready prepared for war.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(17,19);</script>These were those who
waited on the king, besides those whom the king put in the fortified
cities throughout all Judah.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,1);</script>Now Jehoshaphat had
riches and honor in abundance; and he joined affinity with Ahab. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,2);</script>After certain years he went down
to Ahab to Samaria. Ahab killed sheep and cattle for him in abundance, and
for the people who were with him, and moved him to go up with him to
Ramoth Gilead. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,3);</script>Ahab king
of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, “Will you go with me to
Ramoth Gilead?”
<p>He answered him, “I am as you are, and my people as your people. We
will be with you in the war.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,4);</script>Jehoshaphat said to the king of
Israel, “Please inquire first for the word of Yahweh.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,5);</script>Then the king of
Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred men, and said to them,
“Shall we go to Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?”
<p>They said, “Go up; for God will deliver it into the hand of the
king.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,6);</script>But Jehoshaphat said,
“Isn’t there here a prophet of Yahweh besides, that we may inquire of
him?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,7);</script>The king of Israel
said to Jehoshaphat, “There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of
Yahweh; but I hate him, for he never prophesies good concerning me, but
always evil. He is Micaiah the son of Imla.”
<p>Jehoshaphat said, “Don’t let the king say so.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,8);</script>Then the king of
Israel called an officer, and said, “Get Micaiah the son of Imla
quickly.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,9);</script>Now the king of Israel
and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, arrayed in their
robes, and they were sitting in an open place at the entrance of the gate
of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,10);</script>Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah
made him horns of iron, and said, “Thus says Yahweh, ‘With these you
shall push the Syrians, until they are consumed.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,11);</script>All the prophets
prophesied so, saying, “Go up to Ramoth Gilead, and prosper; for Yahweh
will deliver it into the hand of the king.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,12);</script>The messenger who
went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, “Behold, the words of the
prophets declare good to the king with one mouth. Let your word therefore,
please be like one of theirs, and speak good.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,13);</script>Micaiah said, “As
Yahweh lives, what my God says, that will I speak.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,14);</script>When he had come to
the king, the king said to him, “Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth Gilead
to battle, or shall I forbear?”
<p>He said, “Go up, and prosper. They shall be delivered into your
hand.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,15);</script>The king said to him,
“How many times shall I adjure you that you speak to me nothing but the
truth in the name of Yahweh?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,16);</script>He said, “I saw all
Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. Yahweh
said, ‘These have no master. Let them return every man to his house in
peace.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,17);</script>The king of Israel
said to Jehoshaphat, “Didn’t I tell you that he would not prophesy
good concerning me, but evil?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,18);</script>Micaiah said,
“Therefore hear the word of Yahweh: I saw Yahweh sitting on his throne,
and all the army of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,19);</script>Yahweh said, ‘Who
shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth
Gilead?’ One spoke saying in this way, and another saying in that way.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,20);</script>A spirit came out, stood
before Yahweh, and said, ‘I will entice him.’
<p>“Yahweh said to him, ‘How?’
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,21);</script>“He said, ‘I will
go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’
<p>“He said, ‘You will entice him, and will prevail also. Go forth,
and do so.’
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,22);</script>“Now therefore,
behold, Yahweh has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these your prophets;
and Yahweh has spoken evil concerning you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,23);</script>Then Zedekiah the son
of Chenaanah came near, and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said,
“Which way did the Spirit of Yahweh go from me to speak to you?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,24);</script>Micaiah said,
“Behold, you shall see on that day, when you shall go into an inner room
to hide yourself.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,25);</script>The king of Israel
said, “Take Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the
city, and to Joash the king’s son; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,26);</script>and say, ‘Thus says the king,
“Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction
and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.”’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,27);</script>Micaiah said, “If
you return at all in peace, Yahweh has not spoken by me.” He said,
“Listen, you peoples, all of you!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,28);</script>So the king of Israel and
Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,29);</script>The king of Israel said to
Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but you
put on your robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they
went into the battle. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,30);</script>Now the king of Syria had
commanded the captains of his chariots, saying, “Fight neither with
small nor great, except only with the king of Israel.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,31);</script>It happened, when the
captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, “It is the
king of Israel!” Therefore they turned around to fight against him. But
Jehoshaphat cried out, and Yahweh helped him; and God moved them to depart
from him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,32);</script>It happened,
when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel,
that they turned back from pursuing him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,33);</script>A certain man drew his bow at
random, and struck the king of Israel between the joints of the armor.
Therefore he said to the driver of the chariot, “Turn your hand, and
carry me out of the army; for I am severely wounded.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,34);</script>The battle increased that day.
However the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot against the
Syrians until the evening; and about the time of the going down of the
sun, he died.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,1);</script>Jehoshaphat the king
of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,2);</script>Jehu the son of Hanani the seer
went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, “Should you help the
wicked, and love those who hate Yahweh? Because of this, wrath is on you
from before Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,3);</script>Nevertheless there are good
things found in you, in that you have put away the Asheroth out of the
land, and have set your heart to seek God.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,4);</script>Jehoshaphat lived at
Jerusalem: and he went out again among the people from Beersheba to the
hill country of Ephraim, and brought them back to Yahweh, the God of their
fathers. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,5);</script>He set judges in
the land throughout all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(19,6);</script>and said to the judges,
“Consider what you do: for you don’t judge for man, but for Yahweh;
and he is with you in the judgment. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,7);</script>Now therefore let the fear of
Yahweh be on you. Take heed and do it: for there is no iniquity with
Yahweh our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of bribes.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,8);</script>Moreover in Jerusalem
Jehoshaphat appointed Levites and priests, and of the heads of the
fathers’ households of Israel, for the judgment of Yahweh, and for
controversies. They returned to Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,9);</script>He commanded them, saying,
“Thus you shall do in the fear of Yahweh, faithfully, and with a perfect
heart. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,10);</script>Whenever any
controversy shall come to you from your brothers who dwell in their
cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and
ordinances, you shall warn them, that they not be guilty towards Yahweh,
and so wrath come on you and on your brothers. Do this, and you shall not
be guilty. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,11);</script>Behold,
Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of Yahweh; and
Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, in all the
king’s matters: also the Levites shall be officers before you. Deal
courageously, and may Yahweh be with the good.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,1);</script>It happened after
this, that the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them
some of the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,2);</script>Then some came who told
Jehoshaphat, saying, “A great multitude is coming against you from
beyond the sea from Syria. Behold, they are in Hazazon Tamar” (that is,
En Gedi). <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,3);</script>Jehoshaphat was
alarmed, and set himself to seek to Yahweh. He proclaimed a fast
throughout all Judah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,4);</script>Judah gathered themselves
together, to seek help from Yahweh. They came out of all the cities of
Judah to seek Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,5);</script>Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly
of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of Yahweh, before the new court;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(20,6);</script>and he said, “Yahweh,
the God of our fathers, aren’t you God in heaven? Aren’t you ruler
over all the kingdoms of the nations? Power and might are in your hand, so
that no one is able to withstand you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,7);</script>Didn’t you, our God, drive out
the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel, and give it to the
seed of Abraham your friend forever? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,8);</script>They lived in it, and have built
you a sanctuary in it for your name, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,9);</script>‘If evil comes on us—the
sword, judgment, pestilence, or famine—we will stand before this house,
and before you, (for your name is in this house), and cry to you in our
affliction, and you will hear and save.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,10);</script>Now, behold, the children of
Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir, whom you would not let Israel invade, when
they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned aside from them, and
didn’t destroy them; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,11);</script>behold, how they reward us, to
come to cast us out of your possession, which you have given us to
inherit. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,12);</script>Our God, will
you not judge them? For we have no might against this great company that
comes against us; neither know we what to do, but our eyes are on you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,13);</script>All Judah stood
before Yahweh, with their little ones, their wives, and their children.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(20,14);</script>Then the Spirit of
Yahweh came on Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son
of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, the Levite, of the sons of Asaph, in the
midst of the assembly; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,15);</script>and he said, “Listen, all
Judah, and you inhabitants of Jerusalem, and you king Jehoshaphat. Thus
says Yahweh to you, ‘Don’t be afraid, neither be dismayed by reason of
this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God’s. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,16);</script>Tomorrow go down against them.
Behold, they are coming up by the ascent of Ziz. You shall find them at
the end of the valley, before the wilderness of Jeruel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,17);</script>You will not need to fight this
battle. Set yourselves, stand still, and see the salvation of Yahweh with
you, O Judah and Jerusalem. Don’t be afraid, nor be dismayed. Go out
against them tomorrow, for Yahweh is with you.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,18);</script>Jehoshaphat bowed his
head with his face to the ground; and all Judah and the inhabitants of
Jerusalem fell down before Yahweh, worshipping Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,19);</script>The Levites, of the children of
the Kohathites and of the children of the Korahites, stood up to praise
Yahweh, the God of Israel, with an exceeding loud voice. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,20);</script>They rose early in the morning,
and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth,
Jehoshaphat stood and said, “Listen to me, Judah, and you inhabitants of
Jerusalem! Believe in Yahweh your God, so you shall be established!
Believe his prophets, so you shall prosper.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,21);</script>When he had taken
counsel with the people, he appointed those who should sing to Yahweh, and
give praise in holy array, as they went out before the army, and say, Give
thanks to Yahweh; for his loving kindness endures forever. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,22);</script>When they began to sing and to
praise, Yahweh set ambushers against the children of Ammon, Moab, and
Mount Seir, who had come against Judah; and they were struck. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,23);</script>For the children of Ammon and
Moab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir, utterly to kill and
destroy them: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir,
everyone helped to destroy another. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,24);</script>When Judah came to the place
overlooking the wilderness, they looked at the multitude; and behold, they
were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and there were none who escaped.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(20,25);</script>When Jehoshaphat and his
people came to take their spoil, they found among them in abundance both
riches and dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for
themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in
taking the spoil, it was so much. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,26);</script>On the fourth day they assembled
themselves in the valley of Beracah; for there they blessed Yahweh:
therefore the name of that place was called The valley of Beracah to this
day. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,27);</script>Then they returned,
every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in their forefront, to
go again to Jerusalem with joy; for Yahweh had made them to rejoice over
their enemies. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,28);</script>They came
to Jerusalem with stringed instruments and harps and trumpets to the house
of Yahweh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,29);</script>The fear of
God was on all the kingdoms of the countries, when they heard that Yahweh
fought against the enemies of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,30);</script>So the realm of Jehoshaphat was
quiet; for his God gave him rest all around. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,31);</script>Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah:
he was thirty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned
twenty-five years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Azubah the
daughter of Shilhi. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,32);</script>He
walked in the way of Asa his father, and didn’t turn aside from it,
doing that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,33);</script>However the high places were not
taken away; neither as yet had the people set their hearts to the God of
their fathers. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,34);</script>Now the
rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they are written
in the history of Jehu the son of Hanani, which is inserted in the book of
the kings of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,35);</script>After this Jehoshaphat king of
Judah joined himself with Ahaziah king of Israel. The same did very
wickedly: <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,36);</script>and he joined
himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish; and they made the ships
in Ezion Geber. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,37);</script>Then
Eliezer the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat,
saying, “Because you have joined yourself with Ahaziah, Yahweh has
destroyed your works.” The ships were broken, so that they were not able
to go to Tarshish.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,1);</script>Jehoshaphat slept with
his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and
Jehoram his son reigned in his place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,2);</script>He had brothers, the sons of
Jehoshaphat: Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael,
and Shephatiah; all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(21,3);</script>Their father gave them
great gifts, of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with
fortified cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram, because he
was the firstborn. <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,4);</script>Now
when Jehoram was risen up over the kingdom of his father, and had
strengthened himself, he killed all his brothers with the sword, and
various also of the princes of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,5);</script>Jehoram was thirty-two years old
when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,6);</script>He walked in the way of the kings
of Israel, as did the house of Ahab; for he had the daughter of Ahab as
wife: and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,7);</script>However Yahweh would not destroy
the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David,
and as he promised to give a lamp to him and to his children always.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(21,8);</script>In his days Edom revolted
from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,9);</script>Then Jehoram passed over with his
captains, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and
struck the Edomites who surrounded him, along with the captains of the
chariots. <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,10);</script>So Edom
revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day: then Libnah revolted at
the same time from under his hand, because he had forsaken Yahweh, the God
of his fathers. <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,11);</script>Moreover
he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and made the inhabitants of
Jerusalem to play the prostitute, and led Judah astray. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,12);</script>A letter came to him from Elijah
the prophet, saying, “Thus says Yahweh, the God of David your father,
‘Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat your father, nor
in the ways of Asa king of Judah, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,13);</script>but have walked in the way of
the kings of Israel, and have made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem
to play the prostitute, like the house of Ahab did, and also have slain
your brothers of your father’s house, who were better than yourself:
<script type="text/javascript">cb(21,14);</script>behold, Yahweh will
strike with a great plague your people, and your children, and your wives,
and all your substance; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,15);</script>and you shall have great
sickness by disease of your bowels, until your bowels fall out by reason
of the sickness, day by day.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,16);</script>Yahweh stirred up
against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians who are
beside the Ethiopians: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,17);</script>and they came up against Judah,
and broke into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in
the king’s house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was
never a son left him, except Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,18);</script>After all this Yahweh struck him
in his bowels with an incurable disease. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,19);</script>It happened, in process of time,
at the end of two years, that his bowels fell out by reason of his
sickness, and he died of severe diseases. His people made no burning for
him, like the burning of his fathers. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,20);</script>Thirty-two years old was he when
he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years: and he
departed without being desired; and they buried him in the city of David,
but not in the tombs of the kings.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,1);</script>The inhabitants of
Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his place; for the band of
men who came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So
Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,2);</script>Forty-two years old was Ahaziah
when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem: and his
mother’s name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,3);</script>He also walked in the ways of the
house of Ahab; for his mother was his counselor to do wickedly. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,4);</script>He did that which was evil in the
sight of Yahweh, as did the house of Ahab; for they were his counselors
after the death of his father, to his destruction. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,5);</script>He walked also after their
counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war
against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth Gilead: and the Syrians wounded
Joram. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,6);</script>He returned to be
healed in Jezreel of the wounds which they had given him at Ramah, when he
fought against Hazael king of Syria. Azariah the son of Jehoram king of
Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was
sick. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,7);</script>Now the destruction
of Ahaziah was of God, in that he went to Joram: for when he had come, he
went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom Yahweh had
anointed to cut off the house of Ahab. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,8);</script>It happened, when Jehu was
executing judgment on the house of Ahab, that he found the princes of
Judah, and the sons of the brothers of Ahaziah, ministering to Ahaziah,
and killed them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,9);</script>He
sought Ahaziah, and they caught him (now he was hiding in Samaria), and
they brought him to Jehu, and killed him; and they buried him, for they
said, “He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought Yahweh with all his
heart.” The house of Ahaziah had no power to hold the kingdom. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,10);</script>Now when Athaliah the mother of
Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal
seed of the house of Judah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,11);</script>But Jehoshabeath, the daughter
of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among
the king’s sons who were slain, and put him and his nurse in the
bedroom. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of
Jehoiada the priest (for she was the sister of Ahaziah), hid him from
Athaliah, so that she didn’t kill him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,12);</script>He was with them hidden in
God’s house six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,1);</script>In the seventh year
Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah
the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son
of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri,
into covenant with him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,2);</script>They went about in Judah, and
gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the heads of
fathers’ households of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,3);</script>All the assembly made a covenant
with the king in God’s house. He said to them, “Behold, the king’s
son shall reign, as Yahweh has spoken concerning the sons of David.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(23,4);</script>This is the thing that
you shall do. A third part of you, who come in on the Sabbath, of the
priests and of the Levites, shall be porters of the thresholds. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,5);</script>A third part shall be at the
king’s house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation. All the
people shall be in the courts of Yahweh’s house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,6);</script>But let no one come into the
house of Yahweh, except the priests, and those who minister of the
Levites. They shall come in, for they are holy, but all the people shall
follow Yahweh’s instructions. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,7);</script>The Levites shall surround the
king, every man with his weapons in his hand. Whoever comes into the
house, let him be slain. Be with the king when he comes in, and when he
goes out.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,8);</script>So the Levites and all
Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they
took every man his men, those who were to come in on the Sabbath; with
those who were to go out on the Sabbath; for Jehoiada the priest didn’t
dismiss the shift. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,9);</script>Jehoiada the priest delivered to
the captains of hundreds the spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had
been king David’s, which were in God’s house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,10);</script>He set all the people, every man
with his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left
side of the house, along by the altar and the house, around the king.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(23,11);</script>Then they brought out
the king’s son, and put the crown on him, and gave him the testimony,
and made him king: and Jehoiada and his sons anointed him; and they said,
“Long live the king!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,12);</script>When Athaliah heard
the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the
people into the house of Yahweh: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,13);</script>and she looked, and, behold, the
king stood by his pillar at the entrance, and the captains and the
trumpets by the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew
trumpets; the singers also played musical instruments, and led the singing
of praise. Then Athaliah tore her clothes, and said, “Treason!
treason!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,14);</script>Jehoiada the priest
brought out the captains of hundreds who were set over the army, and said
to them, “Bring her out between the ranks; and whoever follows her, let
him be slain with the sword.” For the priest said, “Don’t kill her
in the Yahweh’s house.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,15);</script>So they made way for her. She
went to the entrance of the horse gate to the king’s house; and they
killed her there. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,16);</script>Jehoiada made a covenant between
himself, and all the people, and the king, that they should be Yahweh’s
people. <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,17);</script>All the people
went to the house of Baal, and broke it down, and broke his altars and his
images in pieces, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(23,18);</script>Jehoiada appointed the
officers of the house of Yahweh under the hand of the priests the Levites,
whom David had distributed in the house of Yahweh, to offer the burnt
offerings of Yahweh, as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing
and with singing, according to the order of David. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,19);</script>He set the porters at the gates
of the house of Yahweh, that no one who was unclean in anything should
enter in. <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,20);</script>He took the
captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and
all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of
Yahweh: and they came through the upper gate to the king’s house, and
set the king on the throne of the kingdom. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,21);</script>So all the people of the land
rejoiced, and the city was quiet. Athaliah they had slain with the sword.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,1);</script>Joash was seven years
old when he began to reign; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem: and
his mother’s name was Zibiah, of Beersheba. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,2);</script>Joash did that which was right in
the eyes of Yahweh all the days of Jehoiada the priest. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,3);</script>Jehoiada took for him two wives;
and he became the father of sons and daughters. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,4);</script>It happened after this, that
Joash intended to restore the house of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,5);</script>He gathered together the priests
and the Levites, and said to them, “Go out to the cities of Judah, and
gather money to repair the house of your God from all Israel from year to
year. See that you expedite this matter.” However the Levites didn’t
do it right away. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,6);</script>The
king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said to him, “Why haven’t you
required of the Levites to bring in the tax of Moses the servant of
Yahweh, and of the assembly of Israel, out of Judah and out of Jerusalem,
for the tent of the testimony?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,7);</script>For the sons of Athaliah, that
wicked woman, had broken up God’s house; and they also gave all the
dedicated things of the house of Yahweh to the Baals. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,8);</script>So the king commanded, and they
made a chest, and set it outside at the gate of the house of Yahweh.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(24,9);</script>They made a proclamation
through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in for Yahweh the tax that Moses the
servant of God laid on Israel in the wilderness. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,10);</script>All the princes and all the
people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had
made an end. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,11);</script>It was so,
that whenever the chest was brought to the king’s officers by the hand
of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king’s
scribe and the chief priest’s officer came and emptied the chest, and
took it, and carried it to its place again. Thus they did day by day, and
gathered money in abundance. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,12);</script>The king and Jehoiada gave it to
such as did the work of the service of the house of Yahweh; and they hired
masons and carpenters to restore the house of Yahweh, and also such as
worked iron and brass to repair the house of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,13);</script>So the workmen worked, and the
work of repairing went forward in their hands, and they set up God’s
house in its state, and strengthened it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,14);</script>When they had made an end, they
brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, of which were
made vessels for the house of Yahweh, even vessels with which to minister
and to offer, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. They offered
burnt offerings in the house of Yahweh continually all the days of
Jehoiada. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,15);</script>But Jehoiada
grew old and was full of days, and he died; one hundred thirty years old
was he when he died. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,16);</script>They buried him in the city of
David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, and toward God
and his house. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,17);</script>Now after
the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the
king. Then the king listened to them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,18);</script>They forsook the house of
Yahweh, the God of their fathers, and served the Asherim and the idols:
and wrath came on Judah and Jerusalem for this their guiltiness. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,19);</script>Yet he sent prophets to them, to
bring them again to Yahweh; and they testified against them: but they
would not give ear. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,20);</script>The
Spirit of God came on Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest; and he
stood above the people, and said to them, “Thus says God, ‘Why do you
disobey the commandments of Yahweh, so that you can’t prosper? Because
you have forsaken Yahweh, he has also forsaken you.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,21);</script>They conspired
against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in
the court of the house of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,22);</script>Thus Joash the king didn’t
remember the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but
killed his son. When he died, he said, “May Yahweh look at it, and repay
it.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,23);</script>It happened at
the end of the year, that the army of the Syrians came up against him: and
they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the
people from among the people, and sent all their spoil to the king of
Damascus. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,24);</script>For the army
of the Syrians came with a small company of men; and Yahweh delivered a
very great army into their hand, because they had forsaken Yahweh, the God
of their fathers. So they executed judgment on Joash. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,25);</script>When they were departed for him
(for they left him very sick), his own servants conspired against him for
the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and killed him on his bed,
and he died; and they buried him in the city of David, but they didn’t
bury him in the tombs of the kings. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,26);</script>These are those who conspired
against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the
son of Shimrith the Moabitess. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,27);</script>Now concerning his sons, and the
greatness of the burdens laid on him, and the rebuilding of God’s house,
behold, they are written in the commentary of the book of the kings.
Amaziah his son reigned in his place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,1);</script>Amaziah was
twenty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty-nine
years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Jehoaddan, of Jerusalem.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(25,2);</script>He did that which was
right in the eyes of Yahweh, but not with a perfect heart. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,3);</script>Now it happened, when the kingdom
was established to him, that he killed his servants who had killed the
king his father. <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,4);</script>But he
didn’t put their children to death, but did according to that which is
written in the law in the book of Moses, as Yahweh commanded, saying,
“The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children
die for the fathers; but every man shall die for his own sin.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,5);</script>Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah
together, and ordered them according to their fathers’ houses, under
captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, even all Judah and
Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and upward, and found
them three hundred thousand chosen men, able to go forth to war, who could
handle spear and shield. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,6);</script>He hired also one hundred
thousand mighty men of valor out of Israel for one hundred talents of
silver. <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,7);</script>A man of God came
to him, saying, “O king, don’t let the army of Israel go with you; for
Yahweh is not with Israel, with all the children of Ephraim. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,8);</script>But if you will go, take action,
be strong for the battle. God will overthrow you before the enemy; for God
has power to help, and to overthrow.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,9);</script>Amaziah said to the
man of God, “But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have
given to the army of Israel?”
<p>The man of God answered, “Yahweh is able to give you much more than
this.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,10);</script>Then Amaziah
separated them, the army that had come to him out of Ephraim, to go home
again: therefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they
returned home in fierce anger. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,11);</script>Amaziah took courage, and led
forth his people, and went to the Valley of Salt, and struck ten thousand
of the children of Seir. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,12);</script>The children of Judah carry away
ten thousand alive, and brought them to the top of the rock, and threw
them down from the top of the rock, so that they all were broken in
pieces. <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,13);</script>But the men of
the army whom Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to
battle, fell on the cities of Judah, from Samaria even to Beth Horon, and
struck of them three thousand, and took much spoil. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,14);</script>Now it happened, after that
Amaziah had come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the
gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed
down himself before them, and burned incense to them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,15);</script>Therefore the anger of Yahweh
was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent to him a prophet, who said to
him, “Why have you sought after the gods of the people, which have not
delivered their own people out of your hand?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,16);</script>It happened, as he
talked with him, that the king said to him, “Have we made you one of the
king’s counselors? Stop! Why should you be struck down?”
<p>Then the prophet stopped, and said, “I know that God has determined
to destroy you, because you have done this, and have not listened to my
counsel.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,17);</script>Then Amaziah king of
Judah consulted his advisers, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz the
son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, “Come, let us look one another in
the face.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,18);</script>Joash king of Israel
sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, “The thistle that was in Lebanon
sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my
son as his wife; then a wild animal that was in Lebanon passed by, and
trampled down the thistle. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,19);</script>You say to yourself that you
have struck Edom; and your heart lifts you up to boast. Now stay at home.
Why should you meddle with trouble, that you should fall, even you, and
Judah with you?’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,20);</script>But Amaziah would not
listen; for it was of God, that he might deliver them into the hand of
their enemies, because they had sought after the gods of Edom. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,21);</script>So Joash king of Israel went up;
and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth
Shemesh, which belongs to Judah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,22);</script>Judah was defeated by Israel;
and they fled every man to his tent. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,23);</script>Joash king of Israel took
Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth
Shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of
Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred
cubits. <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,24);</script>He took all the
gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in God’s house with
Obed-Edom, and the treasures of the king’s house, the hostages also, and
returned to Samaria. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,25);</script>Amaziah the son of Joash king of
Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel
fifteen years. <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,26);</script>Now the
rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, aren’t they written
in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,27);</script>Now from the time that Amaziah
turned away from following Yahweh, they made a conspiracy against him in
Jerusalem. He fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish, and
killed him there. <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,28);</script>They
brought him on horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of
Judah.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,1);</script>All the people of
Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the
place of his father Amaziah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,2);</script>He built Eloth, and restored it
to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,3);</script>Sixteen years old was Uzziah when
he began to reign; and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem: and his
mother’s name was Jechiliah, of Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,4);</script>He did that which was right in
the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that his father Amaziah had done.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(26,5);</script>He set himself to seek
God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the vision of God:
and as long as he sought Yahweh, God made him to prosper. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,6);</script>He went forth and warred against
the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh,
and the wall of Ashdod; and he built cities in the country of Ashdod, and
among the Philistines. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,7);</script>God helped him against the
Philistines, and against the Arabians who lived in Gur Baal, and the
Meunim. <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,8);</script>The Ammonites
gave tribute to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad even to the entrance of
Egypt; for he grew exceeding strong. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,9);</script>Moreover Uzziah built towers in
Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning
of the wall, and fortified them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,10);</script>He built towers in the
wilderness, and dug out many cisterns, for he had much livestock; in the
lowland also, and in the plain: and he had farmers and vineyard keepers in
the mountains and in the fruitful fields; for he loved farming. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,11);</script>Moreover Uzziah had an army of
fighting men, who went out to war by bands, according to the number of
their reckoning made by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer, under
the hand of Hananiah, one of the king’s captains. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,12);</script>The whole number of the heads of
fathers’ households, even the mighty men of valor, was two thousand and
six hundred. <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,13);</script>Under their
hand was an army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five
hundred, who made war with mighty power, to help the king against the
enemy. <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,14);</script>Uzziah prepared
for them, even for all the army, shields, and spears, and helmets, and
coats of mail, and bows, and stones for slinging. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,15);</script>He made in Jerusalem engines,
invented by skillful men, to be on the towers and on the battlements, with
which to shoot arrows and great stones. His name spread far abroad; for he
was marvelously helped, until he was strong. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,16);</script>But when he was strong, his
heart was lifted up, so that he did corruptly, and he trespassed against
Yahweh his God; for he went into Yahweh’s temple to burn incense on the
altar of incense. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,17);</script>Azariah the priest went in after
him, and with him eighty priests of Yahweh, who were valiant men: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,18);</script>and they resisted Uzziah the
king, and said to him, “It isn’t for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to
Yahweh, but for the priests the sons of Aaron, who are consecrated to burn
incense. Go out of the sanctuary; for you have trespassed; neither shall
it be for your honor from Yahweh God.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,19);</script>Then Uzziah was
angry; and he had a censer in his hand to burn incense; and while he was
angry with the priests, the leprosy broke forth in his forehead before the
priests in the house of Yahweh, beside the altar of incense. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,20);</script>Azariah the chief priest, and
all the priests, looked on him, and behold, he was leprous in his
forehead, and they thrust him out quickly from there; yes, himself hurried
also to go out, because Yahweh had struck him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,21);</script>Uzziah the king was a leper to
the day of his death, and lived in a separate house, being a leper; for he
was cut off from the house of Yahweh: and Jotham his son was over the
king’s house, judging the people of the land. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,22);</script>Now the rest of the acts of
Uzziah, first and last, Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, wrote.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(26,23);</script>So Uzziah slept with his
fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which
belonged to the kings; for they said, “He is a leper.” Jotham his son
reigned in his place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,1);</script>Jotham was twenty-five
years old when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in
Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(27,2);</script>He did that which was
right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that his father Uzziah had
done: however he didn’t enter into Yahweh’s temple. The people still
did corruptly. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,3);</script>He built
the upper gate of the house of Yahweh, and on the wall of Ophel he built
much. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,4);</script>Moreover he built
cities in the hill country of Judah, and in the forests he built castles
and towers. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,5);</script>He fought
also with the king of the children of Ammon, and prevailed against them.
The children of Ammon gave him the same year one hundred talents of
silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley.
The children of Ammon gave that much to him in the second year also, and
in the third. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,6);</script>So Jotham
became mighty, because he ordered his ways before Yahweh his God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,7);</script>Now the rest of the acts of
Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, behold, they are written in the
book of the kings of Israel and Judah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,8);</script>He was five and twenty years old
when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,9);</script>Jotham slept with his fathers,
and they buried him in the city of David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his
place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,1);</script>Ahaz was twenty years
old when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and
he didn’t do that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, like David his
father; <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,2);</script>but he walked in
the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for the
Baals. <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,3);</script>Moreover he burnt
incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the
fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out
before the children of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,4);</script>He sacrificed and burnt incense
in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,5);</script>Therefore Yahweh his God
delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they struck him, and
carried away of his a great multitude of captives, and brought them to
Damascus. He was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who
struck him with a great slaughter. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,6);</script>For Pekah the son of Remaliah
killed in Judah one hundred twenty thousand in one day, all of them
valiant men; because they had forsaken Yahweh, the God of their fathers.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(28,7);</script>Zichri, a mighty man of
Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the king’s son, and Azrikam the ruler of the
house, and Elkanah who was next to the king. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,8);</script>The children of Israel carried
away captive of their brothers two hundred thousand, women, sons, and
daughters, and took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil
to Samaria. <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,9);</script>But a prophet
of Yahweh was there, whose name was Oded: and he went out to meet the army
that came to Samaria, and said to them, “Behold, because Yahweh, the God
of your fathers, was angry with Judah, he has delivered them into your
hand, and you have slain them in a rage which has reached up to heaven.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(28,10);</script>Now you purpose to keep
under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondservants and bondmaids
for yourselves. Aren’t there even with you trespasses of your own
against Yahweh your God? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,11);</script>Now hear me therefore, and send
back the captives, that you have taken captive from your brothers; for the
fierce wrath of Yahweh is on you.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,12);</script>Then some of the heads of the
children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of
Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of
Hadlai, stood up against those who came from the war, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,13);</script>and said to them, “You shall
not bring in the captives here: for you purpose that which will bring on
us a trespass against Yahweh, to add to our sins and to our trespass; for
our trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,14);</script>So the armed men left
the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the assembly.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(28,15);</script>The men who have been
mentioned by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil
clothed all who were naked among them, dressed them, gave them sandals,
and gave them something to eat and to drink, anointed them, carried all
the feeble of them on donkeys, and brought them to Jericho, the city of
palm trees, to their brothers. Then they returned to Samaria. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,16);</script>At that time king Ahaz sent to
the kings of Assyria to help him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,17);</script>For again the Edomites had come
and struck Judah, and carried away captives. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,18);</script>The Philistines also had invaded
the cities of the lowland, and of the South of Judah, and had taken Beth
Shemesh, and Aijalon, and Gederoth, and Soco with its towns, and Timnah
with its towns, Gimzo also and its towns: and they lived there. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,19);</script>For Yahweh brought Judah low
because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he had dealt wantonly in Judah, and
trespassed severely against Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,20);</script>Tilgath Pilneser king of Assyria
came to him, and distressed him, but didn’t strengthen him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,21);</script>For Ahaz took away a portion out
of the house of Yahweh, and out of the house of the king and of the
princes, and gave it to the king of Assyria: but it didn’t help him.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(28,22);</script>In the time of his
distress, he trespassed yet more against Yahweh, this same king Ahaz.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(28,23);</script>For he sacrificed to the
gods of Damascus, which struck him; and he said, “Because the gods of
the kings of Syria helped them, so I will sacrifice to them, that they may
help me.” But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,24);</script>Ahaz gathered together the
vessels of God’s house, and cut in pieces the vessels of God’s house,
and shut up the doors of the house of Yahweh; and he made him altars in
every corner of Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,25);</script>In every city of Judah he made
high places to burn incense to other gods, and provoked to anger Yahweh,
the God of his fathers. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,26);</script>Now the rest of his acts, and
all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the
kings of Judah and Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,27);</script>Ahaz slept with his fathers, and
they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem; for they didn’t bring
him into the tombs of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in
his place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,1);</script>Hezekiah began to
reign when he was twenty-five years old; and he reigned twenty-nine years
in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Abijah, the daughter of
Zechariah. <script type="text/javascript">cb(29,2);</script>He did that
which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that David his
father had done. <script type="text/javascript">cb(29,3);</script>He in
the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the
house of Yahweh, and repaired them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,4);</script>He brought in the priests and the
Levites, and gathered them together into the broad place on the east,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(29,5);</script>and said to them,
“Listen to me, you Levites! Now sanctify yourselves, and sanctify the
house of Yahweh, the God of your fathers, and carry out the filthiness out
of the holy place. <script type="text/javascript">cb(29,6);</script>For
our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the sight of
Yahweh our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces
from the habitation of Yahweh, and turned their backs. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,7);</script>Also they have shut up the doors
of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor
offered burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,8);</script>Therefore the wrath of Yahweh was
on Judah and Jerusalem, and he has delivered them to be tossed back and
forth, to be an astonishment, and a hissing, as you see with your eyes.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(29,9);</script>For, behold, our fathers
have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are
in captivity for this. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,10);</script>Now it is in my heart to make a
covenant with Yahweh, the God of Israel, that his fierce anger may turn
away from us. <script type="text/javascript">cb(29,11);</script>My sons,
don’t be negligent now; for Yahweh has chosen you to stand before him,
to minister to him, and that you should be his ministers, and burn
incense.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,12);</script>Then the Levites
arose, Mahath, the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons
of the Kohathites; and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and
Azariah the son of Jehallelel; and of the Gershonites, Joah the son of
Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,13);</script>and of the sons of Elizaphan,
Shimri and Jeuel; and of the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(29,14);</script>and of the sons of
Heman, Jehuel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and
Uzziel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(29,15);</script>They gathered
their brothers, and sanctified themselves, and went in, according to the
commandment of the king by the words of Yahweh, to cleanse the house of
Yahweh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(29,16);</script>The priests went
in to the inner part of the house of Yahweh, to cleanse it, and brought
out all the uncleanness that they found in Yahweh’s temple into the
court of the house of Yahweh. The Levites took it, to carry it out abroad
to the brook Kidron. <script type="text/javascript">cb(29,17);</script>Now
they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify, and on the
eighth day of the month came they to the porch of Yahweh; and they
sanctified the house of Yahweh in eight days: and on the sixteenth day of
the first month they made an end. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,18);</script>Then they went in to Hezekiah
the king within the palace, and said, “We have cleansed all the house of
Yahweh, and the altar of burnt offering, with all its vessels, and the
table of show bread, with all its vessels. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,19);</script>Moreover all the vessels, which
king Ahaz in his reign threw away when he trespassed, have we prepared and
sanctified; and behold, they are before the altar of Yahweh.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,20);</script>Then Hezekiah the
king arose early, and gathered the princes of the city, and went up to the
house of Yahweh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(29,21);</script>They
brought seven bulls, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven male
goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for
Judah. He commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the
altar of Yahweh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(29,22);</script>So they
killed the bulls, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on
the altar: and they killed the rams, and sprinkled the blood on the altar:
they killed also the lambs, and sprinkled the blood on the altar. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,23);</script>They brought near the male goats
for the sin offering before the king and the assembly; and they laid their
hands on them: <script type="text/javascript">cb(29,24);</script>and the
priests killed them, and they made a sin offering with their blood on the
altar, to make atonement for all Israel; for the king commanded that the
burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,25);</script>He set the Levites in the house
of Yahweh with cymbals, with stringed instruments, and with harps,
according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king’s seer, and
Nathan the prophet; for the commandment was of Yahweh by his prophets.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(29,26);</script>The Levites stood with
the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,27);</script>Hezekiah commanded to offer the
burnt offering on the altar. When the burnt offering began, the song of
Yahweh began also, and the trumpets, together with the instruments of
David king of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,28);</script>All the assembly worshiped, and
the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded; all this continued until the
burnt offering was finished. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,29);</script>When they had made an end of
offering, the king and all who were present with him bowed themselves and
worshiped. <script type="text/javascript">cb(29,30);</script>Moreover
Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praises to
Yahweh with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. They sang praises
with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshiped. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,31);</script>Then Hezekiah answered, “Now
you have consecrated yourselves to Yahweh; come near and bring sacrifices
and thank offerings into the house of Yahweh.” The assembly brought in
sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a willing heart
brought burnt offerings. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,32);</script>The number of the burnt
offerings which the assembly brought was seventy bulls, one hundred rams,
and two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt offering to Yahweh.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(29,33);</script>The consecrated things
were six hundred head of cattle and three thousand sheep. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,34);</script>But the priests were too few, so
that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: therefore their brothers
the Levites helped them, until the work was ended, and until the priests
had sanctified themselves; for the Levites were more upright in heart to
sanctify themselves than the priests. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,35);</script>Also the burnt offerings were in
abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and with the drink
offerings for every burnt offering. So the service of the house of Yahweh
was set in order. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,36);</script>Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the
people, because of that which God had prepared for the people: for the
thing was done suddenly.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,1);</script>Hezekiah sent to all
Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that
they should come to the house of Yahweh at Jerusalem, to keep the Passover
to Yahweh, the God of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,2);</script>For the king had taken counsel,
and his princes, and all the assembly in Jerusalem, to keep the Passover
in the second month. <script type="text/javascript">cb(30,3);</script>For
they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not
sanctified themselves in sufficient number, neither had the people
gathered themselves together to Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,4);</script>The thing was right in the eyes
of the king and of all the assembly. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,5);</script>So they established a decree to
make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that
they should come to keep the Passover to Yahweh, the God of Israel, at
Jerusalem: for they had not kept it in great numbers in such sort as it is
written. <script type="text/javascript">cb(30,6);</script>So the couriers
went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel
and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, “You
children of Israel, turn again to Yahweh, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and
Israel, that he may return to the remnant that have escaped of you out of
the hand of the kings of Assyria. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,7);</script>Don’t be like your fathers, and
like your brothers, who trespassed against Yahweh, the God of their
fathers, so that he gave them up to desolation, as you see. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,8);</script>Now don’t be stiff-necked, as
your fathers were; but yield yourselves to Yahweh, and enter into his
sanctuary, which he has sanctified forever, and serve Yahweh your God,
that his fierce anger may turn away from you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,9);</script>For if you turn again to Yahweh,
your brothers and your children shall find compassion before those who led
them captive, and shall come again into this land: for Yahweh your God is
gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if you
return to him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,10);</script>So the couriers
passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, even
to Zebulun: but they ridiculed them, and mocked them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,11);</script>Nevertheless certain men of
Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to
Jerusalem. <script type="text/javascript">cb(30,12);</script>Also on Judah
came the hand of God to give them one heart, to do the commandment of the
king and of the princes by the word of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,13);</script>Many people assembled at
Jerusalem to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a
very great assembly. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,14);</script>They arose and took away the
altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they
away, and cast them into the brook Kidron. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,15);</script>Then they killed the Passover on
the fourteenth day of the second month: and the priests and the Levites
were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought burnt offerings into
the house of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,16);</script>They stood in their place after
their order, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests
sprinkled the blood which they received of the hand of the Levites.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(30,17);</script>For there were many in
the assembly who had not sanctified themselves: therefore the Levites were
in charge of killing the Passovers for everyone who was not clean, to
sanctify them to Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,18);</script>For a multitude of the people,
even many of Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not cleansed
themselves, yet they ate the Passover otherwise than it is written. For
Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, “May the good Yahweh pardon
everyone <script type="text/javascript">cb(30,19);</script>who sets his
heart to seek God, Yahweh, the God of his fathers, even if they aren’t
clean according to the purification of the sanctuary.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,20);</script>Yahweh listened to
Hezekiah, and healed the people. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,21);</script>The children of Israel who were
present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with
great gladness; and the Levites and the priests praised Yahweh day by day,
singing with loud instruments to Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,22);</script>Hezekiah spoke comfortably to
all the Levites who had good understanding in the service of Yahweh. So
they ate throughout the feast for the seven days, offering sacrifices of
peace offerings, and making confession to Yahweh, the God of their
fathers. <script type="text/javascript">cb(30,23);</script>The whole
assembly took counsel to keep other seven days; and they kept another
seven days with gladness. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,24);</script>For Hezekiah king of Judah gave
to the assembly for offerings one thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep;
and the princes gave to the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand
sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,25);</script>All the assembly of Judah, with
the priests and the Levites, and all the assembly who came out of Israel,
and the foreigners who came out of the land of Israel, and who lived in
Judah, rejoiced. <script type="text/javascript">cb(30,26);</script>So
there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time of Solomon the son of
David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,27);</script>Then the priests the Levites
arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer
came up to his holy habitation, even to heaven.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,1);</script>Now when all this was
finished, all Israel who were present went out to the cities of Judah, and
broke in pieces the pillars, and cut down the Asherim, and broke down the
high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also
and Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all. Then all the children of
Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(31,2);</script>Hezekiah appointed the
divisions of the priests and the Levites after their divisions, every man
according to his service, both the priests and the Levites, for burnt
offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to
praise in the gates of the camp of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,3);</script>He appointed also the king’s
portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, for the morning and
evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the Sabbaths, and for
the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of
Yahweh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(31,4);</script>Moreover he
commanded the people who lived in Jerusalem to give the portion of the
priests and the Levites, that they might give themselves to the law of
Yahweh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(31,5);</script>As soon as the
commandment came abroad, the children of Israel gave in abundance the
first fruits of grain, new wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the
increase of the field; and the tithe of all things brought they in
abundantly. <script type="text/javascript">cb(31,6);</script>The children
of Israel and Judah, who lived in the cities of Judah, they also brought
in the tithe of cattle and sheep, and the tithe of dedicated things which
were consecrated to Yahweh their God, and laid them by heaps. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,7);</script>In the third month they began to
lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(31,8);</script>When Hezekiah and the
princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed Yahweh, and his people
Israel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(31,9);</script>Then Hezekiah
questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,10);</script>Azariah the chief priest, of the
house of Zadok, answered him and said, “Since people began to bring the
offerings into the house of Yahweh, we have eaten and had enough, and have
left plenty: for Yahweh has blessed his people; and that which is left is
this great store.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,11);</script>Then Hezekiah commanded them to
prepare rooms in the house of Yahweh; and they prepared them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,12);</script>They brought in the offerings
and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully: and over them Conaniah
the Levite was ruler, and Shimei his brother was second. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,13);</script>Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath,
and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and
Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Conaniah and Shimei
his brother, by the appointment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the
ruler of God’s house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,14);</script>Kore the son of Imnah the
Levite, the porter at the east gate, was over the freewill offerings of
God, to distribute the offerings of Yahweh, and the most holy things.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(31,15);</script>Under him were Eden, and
Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities
of the priests, in their office of trust, to give to their brothers by
divisions, as well to the great as to the small: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,16);</script>besides those who were reckoned
by genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, even everyone who
entered into the house of Yahweh, as the duty of every day required, for
their service in their offices according to their divisions; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,17);</script>and those who were reckoned by
genealogy of the priests by their fathers’ houses, and the Levites from
twenty years old and upward, in their offices by their divisions; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,18);</script>and those who were reckoned by
genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their
daughters, through all the congregation: for in their office of trust they
sanctified themselves in holiness. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,19);</script>Also for the sons of Aaron the
priests, who were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every
city, there were men who were mentioned by name, to give portions to all
the males among the priests, and to all who were reckoned by genealogy
among the Levites. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,20);</script>Hezekiah did so throughout all
Judah; and he worked that which was good and right and faithful before
Yahweh his God. <script type="text/javascript">cb(31,21);</script>In every
work that he began in the service of God’s house, and in the law, and in
the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and
prospered.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,1);</script>After these things,
and this faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into
Judah, and encamped against the fortified cities, and thought to win them
for himself. <script type="text/javascript">cb(32,2);</script>When
Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come, and that he was purposed to fight
against Jerusalem, <script type="text/javascript">cb(32,3);</script>he
took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the
springs which were outside of the city; and they helped him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(32,4);</script>So many people gathered together,
and they stopped all the springs, and the brook that flowed through the
midst of the land, saying, “Why should the kings of Assyria come, and
find much water?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,5);</script>He took courage, and
built up all the wall that was broken down, and raised it up to the
towers, and the other wall outside, and strengthened Millo in the city of
David, and made weapons and shields in abundance. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(32,6);</script>He set captains of war over the
people, and gathered them together to him in the broad place at the gate
of the city, and spoke comfortably to them, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(32,7);</script>“Be strong and courageous,
don’t be afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the
multitude who is with him; for there is a greater with us than with him.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(32,8);</script>With him is an arm of
flesh; but with us is Yahweh our God to help us, and to fight our
battles.” The people rested themselves on the words of Hezekiah king of
Judah. <script type="text/javascript">cb(32,9);</script>After this,
Sennacherib king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem, (now he was
before Lachish, and all his power with him), to Hezekiah king of Judah,
and to all Judah who were at Jerusalem, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(32,10);</script>Thus says Sennacherib king of
Assyria, “In whom do you trust, that you remain under siege in
Jerusalem? <script type="text/javascript">cb(32,11);</script>Doesn’t
Hezekiah persuade you, to give you over to die by famine and by thirst,
saying, ‘Yahweh our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of
Assyria?’ <script type="text/javascript">cb(32,12);</script>Hasn’t the
same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded
Judah and Jerusalem, saying, ‘You shall worship before one altar, and on
it you shall burn incense?’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(32,13);</script> Don’t you know what I and my
fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the
nations of the lands in any way able to deliver their land out of my hand?
<script type="text/javascript">cb(32,14);</script>Who was there among all
the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed, that could
deliver his people out of my hand, that your God should be able to deliver
you out of my hand? <script type="text/javascript">cb(32,15);</script>Now
therefore don’t let Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you in this way,
neither believe him; for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to
deliver his people out of my hand, and out of the hand of my fathers. How
much less will your God deliver you out of my hand?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,16);</script>His servants spoke
yet more against Yahweh God, and against his servant Hezekiah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(32,17);</script>He also wrote letters insulting
Yahweh, the God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, “As the
gods of the nations of the lands, which have not delivered their people
out of my hand, so shall the God of Hezekiah not deliver his people out of
my hand.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(32,18);</script>They cried
with a loud voice in the Jews’ language to the people of Jerusalem who
were on the wall, to frighten them, and to trouble them; that they might
take the city. <script type="text/javascript">cb(32,19);</script>They
spoke of the God of Jerusalem, as of the gods of the peoples of the earth,
which are the work of men’s hands. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(32,20);</script>Hezekiah the king, and Isaiah
the prophet the son of Amoz, prayed because of this, and cried to heaven.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(32,21);</script>Yahweh sent an angel,
who cut off all the mighty men of valor, and the leaders and captains, in
the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his
own land. When he had come into the house of his god, those who came forth
from his own bowels killed him there with the sword. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(32,22);</script>Thus Yahweh saved Hezekiah and
the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of
Assyria, and from the hand of all others, and guided them on every side.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(32,23);</script>Many brought gifts to
Yahweh to Jerusalem, and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah; so
that he was exalted in the sight of all nations from thenceforth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(32,24);</script>In those days Hezekiah was sick
even to death: and he prayed to Yahweh; and he spoke to him, and gave him
a sign. <script type="text/javascript">cb(32,25);</script>But Hezekiah
didn’t render again according to the benefit done to him; for his heart
was lifted up: therefore there was wrath on him, and on Judah and
Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(32,26);</script>Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled
himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, so that the wrath of Yahweh didn’t come on them in the days
of Hezekiah. <script type="text/javascript">cb(32,27);</script>Hezekiah
had exceeding much riches and honor: and he provided him treasuries for
silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for
shields, and for all kinds of goodly vessels; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(32,28);</script>storehouses also for the
increase of grain and new wine and oil; and stalls for all kinds of
animals, and flocks in folds. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(32,29);</script>Moreover he provided him cities,
and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance; for God had given him
very much substance. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(32,30);</script>This same Hezekiah also stopped
the upper spring of the waters of Gihon, and brought them straight down on
the west side of the city of David. Hezekiah prospered in all his works.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(32,31);</script>However concerning the
ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent to him to inquire of the
wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might
know all that was in his heart. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(32,32);</script>Now the rest of the acts of
Hezekiah, and his good deeds, behold, they are written in the vision of
Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz, in the book of the kings of Judah and
Israel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(32,33);</script>Hezekiah slept
with his fathers, and they buried him in the ascent of the tombs of the
sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him
honor at his death. Manasseh his son reigned in his place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,1);</script>Manasseh was twelve
years old when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty-five years in
Jerusalem. <script type="text/javascript">cb(33,2);</script>He did that
which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, after the abominations of the
nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(33,3);</script>For he built again the high
places which Hezekiah his father had broken down; and he reared up altars
for the Baals, and made Asheroth, and worshiped all the army of the sky,
and served them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(33,4);</script>He built
altars in the house of Yahweh, of which Yahweh said, “My name shall be
in Jerusalem forever.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(33,5);</script>He built altars for all the army
of the sky in the two courts of the house of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(33,6);</script>He also made his children to pass
through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom; and he practiced
sorcery, and used enchantments, and practiced sorcery, and dealt with
those who had familiar spirits, and with wizards: he worked much evil in
the sight of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(33,7);</script>He set the engraved image of the
idol, which he had made, in God’s house, of which God said to David and
to Solomon his son, “In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have
chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name forever:
<script type="text/javascript">cb(33,8);</script>neither will I any more
remove the foot of Israel from off the land which I have appointed for
your fathers, if only they will observe to do all that I have commanded
them, even all the law and the statutes and the ordinances given by
Moses.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(33,9);</script>Manasseh
seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that they did more evil
than the nations whom Yahweh destroyed before the children of Israel did.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(33,10);</script>Yahweh spoke to
Manasseh, and to his people; but they gave no heed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(33,11);</script>Therefore Yahweh brought on them
the captains of the army of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh in
chains, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(33,12);</script>When he was in distress, he
begged Yahweh his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his
fathers. <script type="text/javascript">cb(33,13);</script>He prayed to
him; and he was entreated by him, and heard his supplication, and brought
him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that Yahweh
was God. <script type="text/javascript">cb(33,14);</script>Now after this
he built an outer wall to the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in
the valley, even to the entrance at the fish gate; and he encircled Ophel
with it, and raised it up to a very great height: and he put valiant
captains in all the fortified cities of Judah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(33,15);</script>He took away the foreign gods,
and the idol out of the house of Yahweh, and all the altars that he had
built in the mountain of the house of Yahweh, and in Jerusalem, and cast
them out of the city. <script type="text/javascript">cb(33,16);</script>He
built up the altar of Yahweh, and offered thereon sacrifices of peace
offerings and of thanksgiving, and commanded Judah to serve Yahweh, the
God of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(33,17);</script>Nevertheless the people
sacrificed still in the high places, but only to Yahweh their God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(33,18);</script>Now the rest of the acts of
Manasseh, and his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers who spoke
to him in the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel, behold, they are written
among the acts of the kings of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(33,19);</script>His prayer also, and how God was
entreated of him, and all his sin and his trespass, and the places in
which he built high places, and set up the Asherim and the engraved
images, before he humbled himself: behold, they are written in the history
of Hozai. <script type="text/javascript">cb(33,20);</script>So Manasseh
slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his
son reigned in his place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(33,21);</script>Amon was twenty-two years old
when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(33,22);</script>He did that which was evil in
the sight of Yahweh, as did Manasseh his father; and Amon sacrificed to
all the engraved images which Manasseh his father had made, and served
them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(33,23);</script>He didn’t humble
himself before Yahweh, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but
this same Amon trespassed more and more. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(33,24);</script>His servants conspired against
him, and put him to death in his own house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(33,25);</script>But the people of the land
killed all those who had conspired against king Amon; and the people of
the land made Josiah his son king in his place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,1);</script>Josiah was eight years
old when he began to reign; and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(34,2);</script>He did that which was
right in the eyes of Yahweh, and walked in the ways of David his father,
and didn’t turn aside to the right hand or to the left. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(34,3);</script>For in the eighth year of his
reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his
father; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from
the high places, and the Asherim, and the engraved images, and the molten
images. <script type="text/javascript">cb(34,4);</script>They broke down
the altars of the Baals in his presence; and the incense altars that were
on high above them he cut down; and the Asherim, and the engraved images,
and the molten images, he broke in pieces, and made dust of them, and
strewed it on the graves of those who had sacrificed to them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(34,5);</script>He burnt the bones of the priests
on their altars, and purged Judah and Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(34,6);</script>He did this in the cities of
Manasseh and Ephraim and Simeon, even to Naphtali, around in their ruins.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(34,7);</script>He broke down the altars,
and beat the Asherim and the engraved images into powder, and cut down all
the incense altars throughout all the land of Israel, and returned to
Jerusalem. <script type="text/javascript">cb(34,8);</script>Now in the
eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land and the house,
he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city,
and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of Yahweh his
God. <script type="text/javascript">cb(34,9);</script>They came to Hilkiah
the high priest, and delivered the money that was brought into God’s
house, which the Levites, the keepers of the threshold, had gathered of
the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of
all Judah and Benjamin, and of the inhabitants of Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(34,10);</script>They delivered it into the hand
of the workmen who had the oversight of the house of Yahweh; and the
workmen who labored in the house of Yahweh gave it to mend and repair the
house; <script type="text/javascript">cb(34,11);</script>even to the
carpenters and to the builders gave they it, to buy cut stone, and timber
for couplings, and to make beams for the houses which the kings of Judah
had destroyed. <script type="text/javascript">cb(34,12);</script>The men
did the work faithfully: and their overseers were Jahath and Obadiah, the
Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons
of the Kohathites, to set it forward; and others of the Levites, all who
were skillful with instruments of music. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(34,13);</script>Also they were over the bearers
of burdens, and set forward all who did the work in every kind of service:
and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(34,14);</script>When they brought out the money
that was brought into the house of Yahweh, Hilkiah the priest found the
book of the law of Yahweh given by Moses. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(34,15);</script>Hilkiah answered Shaphan the
scribe, “I have found the book of the law in the house of Yahweh.”
Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,16);</script>Shaphan carried the
book to the king, and moreover brought back word to the king, saying,
“All that was committed to your servants, they are doing. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(34,17);</script>They have emptied out the money
that was found in the house of Yahweh, and have delivered it into the hand
of the overseers, and into the hand of the workmen.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(34,18);</script>Shaphan the scribe told the
king, saying, “Hilkiah the priest has delivered me a book.” Shaphan
read therein before the king.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,19);</script>It happened, when the
king had heard the words of the law, that he tore his clothes. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(34,20);</script>The king commanded Hilkiah, and
Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the
scribe, and Asaiah the king’s servant, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(34,21);</script>“Go inquire of Yahweh for me,
and for those who are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of
the book that is found; for great is the wrath of Yahweh that is poured
out on us, because our fathers have not kept the word of Yahweh, to do
according to all that is written in this book.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(34,22);</script>So Hilkiah, and they whom the
king had commanded, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the
son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she lived
in Jerusalem in the second quarter;) and they spoke to her to that effect.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(34,23);</script>She said to them,
“Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: ‘Tell the man who sent you to
me, <script type="text/javascript">cb(34,24);</script>“Thus says Yahweh,
‘Behold, I will bring evil on this place, and on its inhabitants, even
all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before
the king of Judah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(34,25);</script>Because they have forsaken me,
and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger
with all the works of their hands; therefore is my wrath poured out on
this place, and it shall not be quenched.’”’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(34,26);</script>But to the king of Judah, who
sent you to inquire of Yahweh, thus you shall tell him, ‘Thus says
Yahweh, the God of Israel: “As touching the words which you have heard,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(34,27);</script>because your heart was
tender, and you humbled yourself before God, when you heard his words
against this place, and against its inhabitants, and have humbled yourself
before me, and have torn your clothes, and wept before me; I also have
heard you,” says Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(34,28);</script>“Behold, I will gather you to
your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, neither
shall your eyes see all the evil that I will bring on this place, and on
its inhabitants.”’”
<p>They brought back word to the king. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(34,29);</script>Then the king sent and gathered
together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(34,30);</script>The king went up to the house of
Yahweh, and all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the
priests, and the Levites, and all the people, both great and small: and he
read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was
found in the house of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(34,31);</script>The king stood in his place, and
made a covenant before Yahweh, to walk after Yahweh, and to keep his
commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart,
and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that were
written in this book. <script type="text/javascript">cb(34,32);</script>He
caused all who were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand. The
inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of
their fathers. <script type="text/javascript">cb(34,33);</script>Josiah
took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to
the children of Israel, and made all who were found in Israel to serve,
even to serve Yahweh their God. All his days they didn’t depart from
following Yahweh, the God of their fathers.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,1);</script>Josiah kept a Passover
to Yahweh in Jerusalem: and they killed the Passover on the fourteenth day
of the first month. <script type="text/javascript">cb(35,2);</script>He
set the priests in their offices, and encouraged them to the service of
the house of Yahweh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(35,3);</script>He
said to the Levites who taught all Israel, who were holy to Yahweh, “Put
the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel
built. There shall no more be a burden on your shoulders. Now serve Yahweh
your God, and his people Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(35,4);</script>Prepare yourselves after your
fathers’ houses by your divisions, according to the writing of David
king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(35,5);</script>Stand in the holy place according
to the divisions of the fathers’ houses of your brothers the children of
the people, and let there be for each a portion of a fathers’ house of
the Levites. <script type="text/javascript">cb(35,6);</script>Kill the
Passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare for your brothers, to do
according to the word of Yahweh by Moses.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,7);</script>Josiah gave to the
children of the people, of the flock, lambs and young goats, all of them
for the Passover offerings, to all who were present, to the number of
thirty thousand, and three thousand bulls: these were of the king’s
substance. <script type="text/javascript">cb(35,8);</script>His princes
gave for a freewill offering to the people, to the priests, and to the
Levites. Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, the rulers of God’s house,
gave to the priests for the Passover offerings two thousand and six
hundred small livestock, and three hundred head of cattle. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(35,9);</script>Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and
Nethanel, his brothers, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, the chiefs of
the Levites, gave to the Levites for the Passover offerings five thousand
small livestock, and five hundred head of cattle. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(35,10);</script>So the service was prepared, and
the priests stood in their place, and the Levites by their divisions,
according to the king’s commandment. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(35,11);</script>They killed the Passover, and
the priests sprinkled the blood which they received of their hand, and the
Levites flayed them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(35,12);</script>They removed the burnt
offerings, that they might give them according to the divisions of the
fathers’ houses of the children of the people, to offer to Yahweh, as it
is written in the book of Moses. So they did with the cattle. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(35,13);</script>They roasted the Passover with
fire according to the ordinance: and the holy offerings boiled they in
pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the
children of the people. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(35,14);</script>Afterward they prepared for
themselves, and for the priests, because the priests the sons of Aaron
were busy with offering the burnt offerings and the fat until night:
therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the
sons of Aaron. <script type="text/javascript">cb(35,15);</script>The
singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the
commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king’s
seer; and the porters were at every gate: they didn’t need to depart
from their service; for their brothers the Levites prepared for them.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(35,16);</script>So all the service of
Yahweh was prepared the same day, to keep the Passover, and to offer burnt
offerings on the altar of Yahweh, according to the commandment of king
Josiah. <script type="text/javascript">cb(35,17);</script>The children of
Israel who were present kept the Passover at that time, and the feast of
unleavened bread seven days. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(35,18);</script>There was no Passover like that
kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did any of the
kings of Israel keep such a Passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and
the Levites, and all Judah and Israel who were present, and the
inhabitants of Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(35,19);</script>In the eighteenth year of the
reign of Josiah was this Passover kept. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(35,20);</script>After all this, when Josiah had
prepared the temple, Neco king of Egypt went up to fight against
Carchemish by the Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(35,21);</script>But he sent ambassadors to him,
saying, “What have I to do with you, you king of Judah? I come not
against you this day, but against the house with which I have war. God has
commanded me to make haste. Beware that it is God who is with me, that he
not destroy you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,22);</script>Nevertheless Josiah
would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might
fight with him, and didn’t listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of
God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(35,23);</script>The archers shot at king Josiah;
and the king said to his servants, “Take me away, because I am seriously
wounded!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,24);</script>So his servants took
him out of the chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had, and
brought him to Jerusalem; and he died, and was buried in the tombs of his
fathers. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(35,25);</script>Jeremiah lamented for Josiah:
and all the singing men and singing women spoke of Josiah in their
lamentations to this day; and they made them an ordinance in Israel: and
behold, they are written in the lamentations. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(35,26);</script>Now the rest of the acts of
Josiah, and his good deeds, according to that which is written in the law
of Yahweh, <script type="text/javascript">cb(35,27);</script>and his acts,
first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of
Israel and Judah.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,1);</script>Then the people of the
land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father’s
place in Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,2);</script>Joahaz was twenty-three years old
when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,3);</script>The king of Egypt deposed him at
Jerusalem, and fined the land one hundred talents of silver and a talent
of gold. <script type="text/javascript">cb(36,4);</script>The king of
Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed
his name to Jehoiakim. Neco took Joahaz his brother, and carried him to
Egypt. <script type="text/javascript">cb(36,5);</script>Jehoiakim was
twenty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years
in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh his
God. <script type="text/javascript">cb(36,6);</script>Against him came up
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to
Babylon. <script type="text/javascript">cb(36,7);</script>Nebuchadnezzar
also carried of the vessels of the house of Yahweh to Babylon, and put
them in his temple at Babylon. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,8);</script>Now the rest of the acts of
Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in
him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and
Judah: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,9);</script>Jehoiachin was eight years old
when he began to reign; and he reigned three months and ten days in
Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,10);</script>At the return of the year king
Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels
of the house of Yahweh, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and
Jerusalem. <script type="text/javascript">cb(36,11);</script>Zedekiah was
twenty-one years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years
in Jerusalem: <script type="text/javascript">cb(36,12);</script>and he did
that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh his God; he didn’t humble
himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of Yahweh.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(36,13);</script>He also rebelled against
king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his
neck, and hardened his heart against turning to Yahweh, the God of Israel.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(36,14);</script>Moreover all the chiefs
of the priests, and the people, trespassed very greatly after all the
abominations of the nations; and they polluted the house of Yahweh which
he had made holy in Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,15);</script>Yahweh, the God of their
fathers, sent to them by his messengers, rising up early and sending,
because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place:
<script type="text/javascript">cb(36,16);</script>but they mocked the
messengers of God, and despised his words, and scoffed at his prophets,
until the wrath of Yahweh arose against his people, until there was no
remedy. <script type="text/javascript">cb(36,17);</script>Therefore he
brought on them the king of the Chaldeans, who killed their young men with
the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion on young
man or virgin, old man or gray-headed: he gave them all into his hand.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(36,18);</script>All the vessels of
God’s house, great and small, and the treasures of the house of Yahweh,
and the treasures of the king, and of his princes, all these he brought to
Babylon. <script type="text/javascript">cb(36,19);</script>They burnt
God’s house, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all its
palaces with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels of it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,20);</script>He carried those who had escaped
from the sword away to Babylon; and they were servants to him and his sons
until the reign of the kingdom of Persia: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,21);</script>to fulfill the word of Yahweh by
the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed its Sabbaths. As long as
it lay desolate it kept Sabbath, to fulfill seventy years. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,22);</script>Now in the first year of Cyrus
king of Persia, that the word of Yahweh by the mouth of Jeremiah might be
accomplished, Yahweh stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so
that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in
writing, saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(36,23);</script>“Thus
says Cyrus king of Persia, ‘Yahweh, the God of heaven, has given all the
kingdoms of the earth to me; and he has commanded me to build him a house
in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all his
people, Yahweh his God be with him, and let him go up.’”
