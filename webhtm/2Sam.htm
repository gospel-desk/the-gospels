The Second Book of Samuel
</h1><p>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,1);</script>It happened after the
death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the
Amalekites, and David had stayed two days in Ziklag; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,2);</script>it happened on the third day, that
behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul, with his clothes torn, and
earth on his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to
the earth, and showed respect. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,3);</script>David said to him, “Where do you
come from?”
<p>He said to him, “I have escaped out of the camp of Israel.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,4);</script>David said to him, “How did it
go? Please tell me.”
<p>He answered, “The people have fled from the battle, and many of the
people also have fallen and are dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are
dead also.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,5);</script>David said to the young
man who told him, “How do you know that Saul and Jonathan his son are
dead?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,6);</script>The young man who told
him said, “As I happened by chance on Mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was
leaning on his spear; and behold, the chariots and the horsemen followed
hard after him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,7);</script>When he
looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. I answered, ‘Here I
am.’ <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,8);</script>He said to me,
‘Who are you?’ I answered him, ‘I am an Amalekite.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,9);</script>He said to me, ‘Please stand
beside me, and kill me; for anguish has taken hold of me, because my life
is yet whole in me.’ <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,10);</script>So
I stood beside him, and killed him, because I was sure that he could not
live after that he had fallen. I took the crown that was on his head, and
the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,11);</script>Then David took hold
on his clothes, and tore them; and likewise all the men who were with him.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,12);</script>They mourned, and wept,
and fasted until evening, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the
people of <a href="#N1">Yahweh,</a> and for the house of Israel; because
they were fallen by the sword. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,13);</script>David said to the young man who
told him, “Where are you from?”
<p>He answered, “I am the son of a foreigner, an Amalekite.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,14);</script>David said to him,
“How were you not afraid to put forth your hand to destroy Yahweh’s
anointed?” <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,15);</script>David called
one of the young men, and said, “Go near, and fall on him.” He struck
him, so that he died. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,16);</script>David said to him, “Your blood
be on your head; for your mouth has testified against you, saying, ‘I
have slain Yahweh’s anointed.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,17);</script>David lamented with
this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,18);</script>(and he commanded them to teach
the children of Judah the song of the bow: behold, it is written in the
book of Jashar):
<dl>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,19);</script>“Your glory,
Israel, is slain on your high places!
<dd>How the mighty have fallen!
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,20);</script>Don’t tell it in
Gath.
<dd>Don’t publish it in the streets of Ashkelon,
<dt>lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,
<dd>lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,21);</script>You mountains of
Gilboa,
<dd>let there be no dew nor rain on you, neither fields of offerings;
<dd>For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away,
<dd>The shield of Saul was not anointed with oil.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,22);</script>From the blood of the
slain,
<dd>from the fat of the mighty,
<dd>Jonathan’s bow didn’t turn back.
<dd>Saul’s sword didn’t return empty.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,23);</script>Saul and Jonathan
were lovely and pleasant in their lives.
<dd>In their death, they were not divided.
<dt>They were swifter than eagles.
<dd>They were stronger than lions.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,24);</script>You daughters of
Israel, weep over Saul,
<dd>who clothed you in scarlet delicately,
<dd>who put ornaments of gold on your clothing.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,25);</script>How are the mighty
fallen in the midst of the battle!
<dd>Jonathan is slain on your high places.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,26);</script>I am distressed for
you, my brother Jonathan.
<dd>You have been very pleasant to me.
<dd>Your love to me was wonderful,
<dd>passing the love of women.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,27);</script>How are the mighty
fallen,
<dd>and the weapons of war perished!”
</dl>
<p> <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,1);</script>It happened after
this, that David inquired of Yahweh, saying, “Shall I go up into any of
the cities of Judah?”
<p>Yahweh said to him, “Go up.”
<p>David said, “Where shall I go up?”
<p>He said, “To Hebron.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,2);</script>So David went up there,
and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of
Nabal the Carmelite. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,3);</script>David
brought up his men who were with him, every man with his household. They
lived in the cities of Hebron. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,4);</script>The men of Judah came, and there
they anointed David king over the house of Judah. They told David, saying,
“The men of Jabesh Gilead were those who buried Saul.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,5);</script>David sent messengers to the men
of Jabesh Gilead, and said to them, “Blessed are you by Yahweh, that you
have shown this kindness to your lord, even to Saul, and have buried him.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,6);</script>Now may Yahweh show loving
kindness and truth to you. I also will reward you for this kindness,
because you have done this thing. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,7);</script>Now therefore let your hands be
strong, and be valiant; for Saul your lord is dead, and also the house of
Judah have anointed me king over them.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,8);</script>Now Abner the son of
Ner, captain of Saul’s army, had taken Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and
brought him over to Mahanaim; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,9);</script>and he made him king over Gilead,
and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over
Benjamin, and over all Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,10);</script>Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, was
forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two
years. But the house of Judah followed David. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,11);</script>The time that David was king in
Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,12);</script>Abner the son of Ner, and the
servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,13);</script>Joab the son of Zeruiah,
and the servants of David, went out, and met them by the pool of Gibeon;
and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on
the other side of the pool. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,14);</script>Abner said to Joab, “Please let
the young men arise and play before us!”
<p>Joab said, “Let them arise!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,15);</script>Then they arose and went over by
number: twelve for Benjamin, and for Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and
twelve of the servants of David. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,16);</script>They each caught his opponent by
the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow’s side; so they fell down
together: therefore that place was called Helkath Hazzurim, which is in
Gibeon. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,17);</script>The battle was
very severe that day: and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before
the servants of David. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,18);</script>The three sons of Zeruiah were
there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a
wild gazelle. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,19);</script>Asahel
pursued after Abner; and in going he didn’t turn to the right hand nor
to the left from following Abner. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,20);</script>Then Abner looked behind him, and
said, “Is it you, Asahel?”
<p>He answered, “It is I.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,21);</script>Abner said to him,
“Turn aside to your right hand or to your left, and grab one of the
young men, and take his armor.” But Asahel would not turn aside from
following him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,22);</script>Abner said
again to Asahel, “Turn aside from following me. Why should I strike you
to the ground? How then should I hold up my face to Joab your brother?”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,23);</script>However he refused to
turn aside. Therefore Abner with the back end of the spear struck him in
the body, so that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there,
and died in the same place. It happened, that as many as came to the place
where Asahel fell down and died stood still. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,24);</script>But Joab and Abishai pursued
after Abner: and the sun went down when they had come to the hill of
Ammah, that lies before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,25);</script>The children of Benjamin
gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one band, and stood
on the top of a hill. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,26);</script>Then Abner called to Joab, and
said, “Shall the sword devour forever? Don’t you know that it will be
bitterness in the latter end? How long shall it be then, before you ask
the people to return from following their brothers?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,27);</script>Joab said, “As <a
href="#N2">God</a> lives, if you had not spoken, surely then in the
morning the people would have gone away, and not each followed his
brother.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,28);</script>So Joab blew
the trumpet; and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no
more, neither fought they any more. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,29);</script>Abner and his men went all that
night through the Arabah; and they passed over the Jordan, and went
through all Bithron, and came to Mahanaim. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,30);</script>Joab returned from following
Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of
David’s servants nineteen men and Asahel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,31);</script>But the servants of David had
struck of Benjamin, and of Abner’s men, so that three hundred sixty men
died. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,32);</script>They took up
Asahel, and buried him in the tomb of his father, which was in Bethlehem.
Joab and his men went all night, and the day broke on them at Hebron.
<p> <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,1);</script>Now there was long war
between the house of Saul and the house of David: and David grew stronger
and stronger, but the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,2);</script>To David were sons born in Hebron:
and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,3);</script>and his second, Chileab, of
Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of
Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,4);</script>and the fourth, Adonijah the son
of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,5);</script>and the sixth, Ithream, of Eglah,
David’s wife. These were born to David in Hebron. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,6);</script>It happened, while there was war
between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself
strong in the house of Saul. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,7);</script>Now Saul had a concubine, whose
name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner,
“Why have you gone in to my father’s concubine?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,8);</script>Then was Abner very angry for the
words of Ishbosheth, and said, “Am I a dog’s head that belongs to
Judah? Today I show kindness to the house of Saul your father, to his
brothers, and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hand of
David; and yet you charge me this day with a fault concerning this woman!
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,9);</script>God do so to Abner, and
more also, if, as Yahweh has sworn to David, I don’t do even so to him;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,10);</script>to transfer the kingdom
from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and
over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,11);</script>He could not answer
Abner another word, because he feared him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,12);</script>Abner sent messengers to David on
his behalf, saying, “Whose is the land?” and saying, “Make your
alliance with me, and behold, my hand shall be with you, to bring all
Israel around to you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,13);</script>He said, “Good; I
will make a treaty with you; but one thing I require of you. That is, you
shall not see my face, unless you first bring Michal, Saul’s daughter,
when you come to see my face.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,14);</script>David sent messengers
to Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, saying, “Deliver me my wife Michal, whom I
pledged to be married to me for one hundred foreskins of the
Philistines.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,15);</script>Ishbosheth sent, and
took her from her husband, even from Paltiel the son of Laish. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,16);</script>Her husband went with her,
weeping as he went, and followed her to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him,
“Go! Return!” and he returned. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,17);</script>Abner had communication with the
elders of Israel, saying, “In times past, you sought for David to be
king over you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,18);</script>Now then
do it; for Yahweh has spoken of David, saying, ‘By the hand of my
servant David, I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the
Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,19);</script>Abner also spoke in
the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in
Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and to the whole house of Benjamin.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,20);</script>So Abner came to David to
Hebron, and twenty men with him. David made Abner and the men who were
with him a feast. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,21);</script>Abner
said to David, “I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel to my
lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may
reign over all that your soul desires.” David sent Abner away; and he
went in peace.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,22);</script>Behold, the servants
of David and Joab came from a foray, and brought in a great spoil with
them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away,
and he was gone in peace. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,23);</script>When Joab and all the army who
was with him had come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came
to the king, and he has sent him away, and he is gone in peace. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,24);</script>Then Joab came to the king, and
said, “What have you done? Behold, Abner came to you. Why is it that you
have sent him away, and he is quite gone? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,25);</script>You know Abner the son of Ner,
that he came to deceive you, and to know your going out and your coming
in, and to know all that you do.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,26);</script>When Joab had come out
from David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from
the well of Sirah; but David didn’t know it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,27);</script>When Abner was returned to
Hebron, Joab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him
quietly, and struck him there in the body, so that he died, for the blood
of Asahel his brother. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,28);</script>Afterward, when David heard it,
he said, “I and my kingdom are guiltless before Yahweh forever of the
blood of Abner the son of Ner. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,29);</script>Let it fall on the head of Joab,
and on all his father’s house. Let there not fail from the house of Joab
one who has an issue, or who is a leper, or who leans on a staff, or who
falls by the sword, or who lacks bread.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,30);</script>So Joab and Abishai his brother
killed Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the
battle. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,31);</script>David said to
Joab, and to all the people who were with him, Tear your clothes, and
clothe yourselves with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. King David
followed the bier. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,32);</script>They
buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the
grave of Abner; and all the people wept. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,33);</script>The king lamented for Abner, and
said, “Should Abner die as a fool dies? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,34);</script>Your hands were not bound, nor
your feet put into fetters. As a man falls before the children of
iniquity, so you fell.”
<p>All the people wept again over him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,35);</script>All the people came to cause
David to eat bread while it was yet day; but David swore, saying, “God
do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or anything else, until the
sun goes down.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,36);</script>All the
people took notice of it, and it pleased them; as whatever the king did
pleased all the people. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,37);</script>So all the people and all Israel
understood that day that it was not of the king to kill Abner the son of
Ner. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,38);</script>The king said to his
servants, “Don’t you know that there a prince and a great man has
fallen this day in Israel? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,39);</script>I am this day weak, though
anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah are too hard for me. May
Yahweh reward the evildoer according to his wickedness.”
<p> <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,1);</script>When Saul’s son
heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands became feeble, and all the
Israelites were troubled. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,2);</script>Saul’s son had two men who were
captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the
other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of
Benjamin (for Beeroth also is reckoned to Benjamin: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,3);</script>and the Beerothites fled to
Gittaim, and have lived as foreigners there until this day). <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,4);</script>Now Jonathan, Saul’s son, had a
son who was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the news came of
Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel; and his nurse took him up, and fled: and
it happened, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. His
name was Mephibosheth. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,5);</script>The
sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the
heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, as he took his rest at noon.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,6);</script>They came there into the
midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they
struck him in the body: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,7);</script>Now when they came into the house,
as he lay on his bed in his bedroom, they struck him, and killed him, and
beheaded him, and took his head, and went by the way of the Arabah all
night. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,8);</script>They brought the
head of Ishbosheth to David to Hebron, and said to the king, “Behold,
the head of Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life!
Yahweh has avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,9);</script>David answered Rechab
and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to
them, “As Yahweh lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,10);</script>when someone told me,
‘Behold, Saul is dead,’ thinking to have brought good news, I took
hold of him, and killed him in Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for
his news. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,11);</script>How much more,
when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house on his bed,
shall I not now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the
earth?” <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,12);</script>David commanded
his young men, and they killed them, and cut off their hands and their
feet, and hanged them up beside the pool in Hebron. But they took the head
of Ishbosheth, and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,1);</script>Then came all the
tribes of Israel to David to Hebron, and spoke, saying, “Behold, we are
your bone and your flesh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,2);</script>In times past, when Saul was king
over us, it was you who led out and brought in Israel. Yahweh said to you,
‘You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince over
Israel.’” <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,3);</script>So all the
elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a
covenant with them in Hebron before Yahweh; and they anointed David king
over Israel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,4);</script>David was
thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(5,5);</script>In Hebron he reigned over
Judah seven years and six months; and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three
years over all Israel and Judah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,6);</script>The king and his men went to
Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spoke to
David, saying, “Unless you take away the blind and the lame, you shall
not come in here”; thinking, “David can’t come in here.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,7);</script>Nevertheless David took the
stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of David. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,8);</script>David said on that day, “Whoever
strikes the Jebusites, let him get up to the watercourse, and strike the
lame and the blind, who are hated by David’s soul.” Therefore they
say, “The blind and the lame can’t come into the house.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,9);</script>David lived in the stronghold, and
called it the city of David. David built around from Millo and inward.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(5,10);</script>David grew greater and
greater; for Yahweh, the God of Armies, was with him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,11);</script>Hiram king of Tyre sent
messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons; and they
built David a house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,12);</script>David perceived that Yahweh had
established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for
his people Israel’s sake. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,13);</script>David took him more concubines
and wives out of Jerusalem, after he had come from Hebron; and there were
yet sons and daughters born to David. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,14);</script>These are the names of those who
were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and
Solomon, <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,15);</script>and Ibhar, and
Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,16);</script>and Elishama, and Eliada, and
Eliphelet. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,17);</script>When the
Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the
Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to
the stronghold. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,18);</script>Now the
Philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(5,19);</script>David inquired of Yahweh,
saying, “Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you deliver them
into my hand?”
<p>Yahweh said to David, “Go up; for I will certainly deliver the
Philistines into your hand.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,20);</script>David came to Baal
Perazim, and David struck them there; and he said, “Yahweh has broken my
enemies before me, like the breach of waters.” Therefore he called the
name of that place Baal Perazim. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,21);</script>They left their images there; and
David and his men took them away. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,22);</script>The Philistines came up yet
again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,23);</script>When David inquired of Yahweh, he
said, “You shall not go up. Circle around behind them, and attack them
over against the mulberry trees. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,24);</script>It shall be, when you hear the
sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then you shall
stir yourself up; for then Yahweh has gone out before you to strike the
army of the Philistines.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,25);</script>David did so, as
Yahweh commanded him, and struck the Philistines from Geba until you come
to Gezer.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,1);</script>David again gathered
together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,2);</script>David arose, and went with all the
people who were with him, from Baale Judah, to bring up from there the ark
of God, which is called by the Name, even the name of Yahweh of Armies who
sits above the cherubim. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,3);</script>They set the ark of God on a new
cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in the hill:
and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,4);</script>They brought it out of the house
of Abinadab, which was in the hill, with the ark of God: and Ahio went
before the ark. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,5);</script>David and
all the house of Israel played before Yahweh with all kinds of instruments
made of fir wood, and with harps, and with stringed instruments, and with
tambourines, and with castanets, and with cymbals. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,6);</script>When they came to the threshing
floor of Nacon, Uzzah reached for the ark of God, and took hold of it; for
the cattle stumbled. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,7);</script>The
anger of Yahweh was kindled against Uzzah; and God struck him there for
his error; and there he died by the ark of God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,8);</script>David was displeased, because
Yahweh had broken forth on Uzzah; and he called that place Perez Uzzah, to
this day. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,9);</script>David was afraid
of Yahweh that day; and he said, “How shall the ark of Yahweh come to
me?” <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,10);</script>So David would not
move the ark of Yahweh to be with him in the city of David; but David
carried it aside into the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,11);</script>The ark of Yahweh remained in the
house of Obed-Edom the Gittite three months: and Yahweh blessed Obed-Edom,
and all his house. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,12);</script>It was
told king David, saying, “Yahweh has blessed the house of Obed-Edom, and
all that pertains to him, because of the ark of God.”
<p>David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom
into the city of David with joy. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,13);</script>It was so, that, when those who
bore the ark of Yahweh had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a
fattened calf. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,14);</script>David
danced before Yahweh with all his might; and David was clothed in a linen
ephod. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,15);</script>So David and all
the house of Israel brought up the ark of Yahweh with shouting, and with
the sound of the trumpet. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,16);</script>It was so, as the ark of Yahweh
came into the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out
at the window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before Yahweh; and
she despised him in her heart. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,17);</script>They brought in the ark of
Yahweh, and set it in its place, in the midst of the tent that David had
pitched for it; and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings
before Yahweh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,18);</script>When David
had made an end of offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings, he
blessed the people in the name of Yahweh of Armies. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,19);</script>He gave to all the people, even
among the whole multitude of Israel, both to men and women, to everyone a
portion of bread, dates, and raisins. So all the people departed everyone
to his house. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,20);</script>Then David
returned to bless his household. Michal the daughter of Saul came out to
meet David, and said, “How glorious the king of Israel was today, who
uncovered himself today in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as
one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,21);</script>David said to Michal,
“It was before Yahweh, who chose me above your father, and above all his
house, to appoint me prince over the people of Yahweh, over Israel.
Therefore will I celebrate before Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,22);</script>I will be yet more vile than
this, and will be base in my own sight. But of the handmaids of whom you
have spoken, they shall honor me.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,23);</script>Michal the daughter of Saul had
no child to the day of her death.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,1);</script>It happened, when the
king lived in his house, and Yahweh had given him rest from all his
enemies all around, <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,2);</script>that
the king said to Nathan the prophet, “See now, I dwell in a house of
cedar, but the ark of God dwells within curtains.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,3);</script>Nathan said to the
king, “Go, do all that is in your heart; for Yahweh is with you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,4);</script>It happened the same
night, that the word of Yahweh came to Nathan, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,5);</script>“Go and tell my servant David,
‘Thus says Yahweh, “Shall you build me a house for me to dwell in?
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,6);</script>For I have not lived in a
house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt,
even to this day, but have moved around in a tent and in a tabernacle.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,7);</script>In all places in which I
have walked with all the children of Israel, did I say a word to any of
the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people Israel,
saying, ‘Why have you not built me a house of cedar?’”’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,8);</script>Now therefore you shall tell my
servant David this, ‘Thus says Yahweh of Armies, “I took you from the
sheep pen, from following the sheep, that you should be prince over my
people, over Israel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,9);</script>I
have been with you wherever you went, and have cut off all your enemies
from before you. I will make you a great name, like the name of the great
ones who are in the earth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,10);</script>I will appoint a place for my
people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own
place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness
afflict them any more, as at the first, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,11);</script>and as from the day that I
commanded judges to be over my people Israel. I will cause you to rest
from all your enemies. Moreover Yahweh tells you that Yahweh will make you
a house. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,12);</script>When your days
are fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your fathers, I will set up your
seed after you, who shall proceed out of your bowels, and I will establish
his kingdom. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,13);</script>He shall
build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom
forever. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,14);</script>I will be his
father, and he shall be my son. If he commits iniquity, I will chasten him
with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,15);</script>but my loving kindness shall not
depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before you.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,16);</script>Your house and your
kingdom shall be made sure forever before you. Your throne shall be
established forever.”’” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,17);</script>According to all these words, and
according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,18);</script>Then David the king
went in, and sat before Yahweh; and he said, “Who am I, <a
href="#N3">Lord</a> Yahweh, and what is my house, that you have brought me
thus far? <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,19);</script>This was yet a
small thing in your eyes, Lord Yahweh; but you have spoken also of your
servant’s house for a great while to come; and this after the way of
men, Lord Yahweh! <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,20);</script>What
more can David say to you? For you know your servant, Lord Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,21);</script>For your word’s sake, and
according to your own heart, you have worked all this greatness, to make
your servant know it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,22);</script>Therefore you are great, Yahweh
God. For there is none like you, neither is there any God besides you,
according to all that we have heard with our ears. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,23);</script>What one nation in the earth is
like your people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem to himself for
a people, and to make himself a name, and to do great things for you, and
awesome things for your land, before your people, whom you redeem to
yourself out of Egypt, from the nations and their gods? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,24);</script>You established for yourself your
people Israel to be a people to you forever; and you, Yahweh, became their
God. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,25);</script>Now, Yahweh God, the
word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning his
house, confirm it forever, and do as you have spoken. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,26);</script>Let your name be magnified
forever, saying, ‘Yahweh of Armies is God over Israel; and the house of
your servant David shall be established before you.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,27);</script>For you, Yahweh of Armies, the
God of Israel, have revealed to your servant, saying, ‘I will build you
a house.’ Therefore your servant has found in his heart to pray this
prayer to you.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,28);</script>“Now, O Lord Yahweh,
you are God, and your words are truth, and you have promised this good
thing to your servant. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,29);</script>Now therefore let it please you
to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before
you; for you, Lord Yahweh, have spoken it. Let the house of your servant
be blessed forever with your blessing.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,1);</script>After this it happened
that David struck the Philistines, and subdued them: and David took the
bridle of the mother city out of the hand of the Philistines. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,2);</script>He struck Moab, and measured them
with the line, making them to lie down on the ground; and he measured two
lines to put to death, and one full line to keep alive. The Moabites
became servants to David, and brought tribute. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,3);</script>David struck also Hadadezer the
son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his dominion at the
River. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,4);</script>David took from him
one thousand seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and
David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for one
hundred chariots. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,5);</script>When the
Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David struck of
the Syrians two and twenty thousand men. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,6);</script>Then David put garrisons in Syria
of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought
tribute. Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,7);</script>David took the shields of gold
that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,8);</script>From Betah and from
Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,9);</script>When Toi king of Hamath
heard that David had struck all the army of Hadadezer, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,10);</script>then Toi sent Joram his son to
king David, to Greet him, and to bless him, because he had fought against
Hadadezer and struck him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. Joram brought
with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass:
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,11);</script>King David also dedicated
these to Yahweh, with the silver and gold that he dedicated of all the
nations which he subdued; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,12);</script>of Syria, and of Moab, and of the
children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil
of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,13);</script>David earned a reputation when he
returned from smiting the Syrians in the Valley of Salt, even eighteen
thousand men. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,14);</script>He put
garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all the
Edomites became servants to David. Yahweh gave victory to David wherever
he went. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,15);</script>David reigned
over all Israel; and David executed justice and righteousness to all his
people. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,16);</script>Joab the son of
Zeruiah was over the army; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,17);</script>and Zadok the son of
Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; and Seraiah was
scribe; <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,18);</script>and Benaiah the
son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David’s
sons were chief ministers.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,1);</script>David said, “Is there
yet any who is left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for
Jonathan’s sake?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,2);</script>There was of the house of Saul a
servant whose name was Ziba, and they called him to David; and the king
said to him, “Are you Ziba?”
<p>He said, “Your servant is he.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,3);</script>The king said, “Is
there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of
God to him?”
<p>Ziba said to the king, “Jonathan has yet a son, who is lame of his
feet.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,4);</script>The king said to him,
“Where is he?”
<p>Ziba said to the king, “Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son
of Ammiel, in Lo Debar.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,5);</script>Then king David sent,
and fetched him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo
Debar. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,6);</script>Mephibosheth, the
son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David, and fell on his face, and
showed respect. David said, “Mephibosheth.”
<p>He answered, “Behold, your servant!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,7);</script>David said to him,
“Don’t be afraid of him; for I will surely show you kindness for
Jonathan your father’s sake, and will restore to you all the land of
Saul your father. You shall eat bread at my table continually.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,8);</script>He bowed down, and said, “What
is your servant, that you should look on such a dead dog as I am?”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,9);</script>Then the king called to
Ziba, Saul’s servant, and said to him, “All that pertained to Saul and
to all his house have I given to your master’s son. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,10);</script>You shall till the land for him,
you, and your sons, and your servants; and you shall bring in the harvest,
that your master’s son may have bread to eat: but Mephibosheth your
master’s son shall eat bread always at my table.” Now Ziba had fifteen
sons and twenty servants. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,11);</script>Then Ziba said to the king,
“According to all that my lord the king commands his servant, so your
shall servant do.” So Mephibosheth ate at the king’s table, like one
of the king’s sons. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,12);</script>Mephibosheth had a young son,
whose name was Mica. All that lived in the house of Ziba were servants to
Mephibosheth. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,13);</script>So
Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem; for he ate continually at the king’s
table. He was lame in both his feet.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,1);</script>It happened after
this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son
reigned in his place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,2);</script>David said, “I will show
kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness to
me.” So David sent by his servants to comfort him concerning his father.
David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,3);</script>But the princes of the
children of Ammon said to Hanun their lord, “Do you think that David
honors your father, in that he has sent comforters to you? Hasn’t David
sent his servants to you to search the city, and to spy it out, and to
overthrow it?” <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,4);</script>So Hanun
took David’s servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and
cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent
them away. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,5);</script>When they told
it to David, he sent to meet them; for the men were greatly ashamed. The
king said, “Wait at Jericho until your beards have grown, and then
return.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,6);</script>When the children of
Ammon saw that they were become odious to David, the children of Ammon
sent and hired the Syrians of Beth Rehob, and the Syrians of Zobah, twenty
thousand footmen, and the king of Maacah with one thousand men, and the
men of Tob twelve thousand men. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,7);</script>When David heard of it, he sent
Joab, and all the army of the mighty men. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,8);</script>The children of Ammon came out,
and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate: and the Syrians
of Zobah and of Rehob, and the men of Tob and Maacah, were by themselves
in the field. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,9);</script>Now when
Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose
of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the
Syrians: <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,10);</script>The rest of the
people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and he put them
in array against the children of Ammon. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,11);</script>He said, “If the Syrians are
too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the children of Ammon
are too strong for you, then I will come and help you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,12);</script>Be courageous, and let us be
strong for our people, and for the cities of our God; and Yahweh do that
which seems good to him.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,13);</script>So Joab and the people who were
with him drew near to the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before
him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,14);</script>When the children
of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai,
and entered into the city. Then Joab returned from the children of Ammon,
and came to Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,15);</script>When the Syrians saw that they
were defeated by Israel, they gathered themselves together. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,16);</script>Hadadezer sent, and brought out
the Syrians who were beyond the River: and they came to Helam, with
Shobach the captain of the army of Hadadezer at their head. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,17);</script>It was told David; and he
gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came to
Helam. The Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with
him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,18);</script>The Syrians fled
before Israel; and David killed of the Syrians seven hundred charioteers,
and forty thousand horsemen, and struck Shobach the captain of their army,
so that he died there. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,19);</script>When all the kings who were
servants to Hadadezer saw that they were defeated before Israel, they made
peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the
children of Ammon any more.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,1);</script>It happened, at the
return of the year, at the time when kings go out, that David sent Joab,
and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children
of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,2);</script>It happened at evening, that
David arose from off his bed, and walked on the roof of the king’s
house: and from the roof he saw a woman bathing; and the woman was very
beautiful to look on. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,3);</script>David sent and inquired after the
woman. One said, “Isn’t this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the
wife of Uriah the Hittite?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,4);</script>David sent messengers,
and took her; and she came in to him, and he lay with her (for she was
purified from her uncleanness); and she returned to her house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,5);</script>The woman conceived; and she sent
and told David, and said, “I am with child.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,6);</script>David sent to Joab,
“Send me Uriah the Hittite.” Joab sent Uriah to David. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,7);</script>When Uriah had come to him, David
asked of him how Joab did, and how the people fared, and how the war
prospered. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,8);</script>David said to
Uriah, “Go down to your house, and wash your feet.” Uriah departed out
of the king’s house, and a gift from the king was sent after him.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,9);</script>But Uriah slept at the
door of the king’s house with all the servants of his lord, and didn’t
go down to his house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,10);</script>When they had told David,
saying, “Uriah didn’t go down to his house,” David said to Uriah,
“Haven’t you come from a journey? Why didn’t you go down to your
house?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,11);</script>Uriah said to David,
“The ark, Israel, and Judah, are staying in tents; and my lord Joab, and
the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open field. Shall I then go
into my house to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? As you live,
and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,12);</script>David said to Uriah,
“Stay here today also, and tomorrow I will let you depart.” So Uriah
stayed in Jerusalem that day, and the next day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,13);</script>When David had called him, he
ate and drink before him; and he made him drunk. At evening, he went out
to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but didn’t go down to
his house. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,14);</script>It happened
in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand
of Uriah. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,15);</script>He wrote in
the letter, saying, “Send Uriah to the forefront of the hottest battle,
and retreat from him, that he may be struck, and die.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,16);</script>It happened, when
Joab kept watch on the city, that he assigned Uriah to the place where he
knew that valiant men were. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,17);</script>The men of the city went out,
and fought with Joab. Some of the people fell, even of the servants of
David; and Uriah the Hittite died also. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,18);</script>Then Joab sent and told David
all the things concerning the war; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,19);</script>and he commanded the messenger,
saying, “When you have finished telling all the things concerning the
war to the king, <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,20);</script>it
shall be that, if the king’s wrath arise, and he asks you, ‘Why did
you go so near to the city to fight? Didn’t you know that they would
shoot from the wall? <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,21);</script>who
struck Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Didn’t a woman cast an upper
millstone on him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go
so near the wall?’ then you shall say, ‘Your servant Uriah the Hittite
is dead also.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,22);</script>So the messenger
went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,23);</script>The messenger said to David,
“The men prevailed against us, and came out to us into the field, and we
were on them even to the entrance of the gate. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,24);</script>The shooters shot at your
servants from off the wall; and some of the king’s servants are dead,
and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,25);</script>Then David said to
the messenger, “Thus you shall tell Joab, ‘Don’t let this thing
displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another. Make your
battle stronger against the city, and overthrow it.’ Encourage him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,26);</script>When the wife of
Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she made lamentation for her
husband. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,27);</script>When the
mourning was past, David sent and took her home to his house, and she
became his wife, and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done
displeased Yahweh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,1);</script>Yahweh sent Nathan to
David. He came to him, and said to him, “There were two men in one city;
the one rich, and the other poor. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,2);</script>The rich man had very many flocks
and herds, <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,3);</script>but the poor
man had nothing, except one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and
raised. It grew up together with him, and with his children. It ate of his
own food, drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was to him like
a daughter. <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,4);</script>A traveler
came to the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his
own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man who had come to him, but took the
poor man’s lamb, and dressed it for the man who had come to him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,5);</script>David’s anger was
greatly kindled against the man, and he said to Nathan, “As Yahweh
lives, the man who has done this is worthy to die! <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,6);</script>He shall restore the lamb
fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,7);</script>Nathan said to David,
“You are the man. This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: ‘I
anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you out of the hand of
Saul. <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,8);</script>I gave you your
master’s house, and your master’s wives into your bosom, and gave you
the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that would have been too little,
I would have added to you many more such things. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,9);</script>Why have you despised the word of
Yahweh, to do that which is evil in his sight? You have struck Uriah the
Hittite with the sword, and have taken his wife to be your wife, and have
slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,10);</script>Now therefore the sword will
never depart from your house, because you have despised me, and have taken
the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.’
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,11);</script>“This is what
Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I will raise up evil against you out of your own
house; and I will take your wives before your eyes, and give them to your
neighbor, and he will lie with your wives in the sight of this sun.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(12,12);</script>For you did it secretly,
but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,13);</script>David said to Nathan,
“I have sinned against Yahweh.”
<p>Nathan said to David, “Yahweh also has put away your sin. You will
not die. <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,14);</script>However,
because by this deed you have given great occasion to Yahweh’s enemies
to blaspheme, the child also who is born to you shall surely die.”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(12,15);</script>Nathan departed to his
house.
<p>Yahweh struck the child that Uriah’s wife bore to David, and it was
very sick. <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,16);</script>David
therefore begged God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay
all night on the earth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,17);</script>The elders of his house arose
beside him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did
he eat bread with them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,18);</script>It happened on the seventh day,
that the child died. The servants of David feared to tell him that the
child was dead; for they said, “Behold, while the child was yet alive,
we spoke to him, and he didn’t listen to our voice. How will he then
harm himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,19);</script>But when David saw
that his servants were whispering together, David perceived that the child
was dead; and David said to his servants, “Is the child dead?”
<p>They said, “He is dead.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,20);</script>Then David arose from
the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his clothing; and
he came into the house of Yahweh, and worshiped: then he came to his own
house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he ate.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(12,21);</script>Then his servants said
to him, “What is this that you have done? You fasted and wept for the
child while he was alive; but when the child was dead, you rose up and ate
bread.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,22);</script>He said, “While the
child was yet alive, I fasted and wept; for I said, ‘Who knows whether
Yahweh will not be gracious to me, that the child may live?’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,23);</script>But now he is dead, why should I
fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not
return to me.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,24);</script>David comforted
Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her, and lay with her. She bore a son,
and he called his name Solomon. Yahweh loved him; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,25);</script>and he sent by the hand of
Nathan the prophet; and he named him Jedidiah, for Yahweh’s sake.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(12,26);</script>Now Joab fought against
Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,27);</script>Joab sent messengers to David,
and said, “I have fought against Rabbah. Yes, I have taken the city of
waters. <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,28);</script>Now therefore
gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and
take it; lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,29);</script>David gathered all
the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took
it. <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,30);</script>He took the crown of
their king from off his head; and its weight was a talent of gold, and in
it were precious stones; and it was set on David’s head. He brought out
the spoil of the city, exceeding much. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,31);</script>He brought out the people who
were therein, and put them under saws, and under iron picks, and under
axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick kiln: and he did so to
all the cities of the children of Ammon. David and all the people returned
to Jerusalem.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,1);</script>It happened after
this, that Absalom the son of David had a beautiful sister, whose name was
Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,2);</script>Amnon was so troubled that he
fell sick because of his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and it seemed
hard to Amnon to do anything to her. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,3);</script>But Amnon had a friend, whose
name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s brother; and Jonadab was a
very subtle man. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,4);</script>He said
to him, “Why, son of the king, are you so sad from day to day? Won’t
you tell me?”
<p>Amnon said to him, “I love Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,5);</script>Jonadab said to him,
“Lay down on your bed, and pretend to be sick. When your father comes to
see you, tell him, ‘Please let my sister Tamar come and give me bread to
eat, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it from
her hand.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,6);</script>So Amnon lay down and
faked being sick. When the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king,
“Please let my sister Tamar come, and make me a couple of cakes in my
sight, that I may eat from her hand.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,7);</script>Then David sent home to Tamar,
saying, “Go now to your brother Amnon’s house, and prepare food for
him.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,8);</script>So Tamar went to
her brother Amnon’s house; and he was laid down. She took dough, and
kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,9);</script>She took the pan, and poured them
out before him; but he refused to eat. Amnon said, “Have all men leave
me.” Every man went out from him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,10);</script>Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring
the food into the room, that I may eat from your hand.” Tamar took the
cakes which she had made, and brought them into the room to Amnon her
brother. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,11);</script>When she had
brought them near to him to eat, he took hold of her, and said to her,
“Come, lie with me, my sister!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,12);</script>She answered him,
“No, my brother, do not force me! For no such thing ought to be done in
Israel. Don’t you do this folly. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,13);</script>I, where would I carry my shame?
And as for you, you will be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore,
please speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,14);</script>However he would not
listen to her voice; but being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay
with her. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,15);</script>Then Amnon
hated her with exceeding great hatred; for the hatred with which he hated
her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. Amnon said to
her, “Arise, be gone!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,16);</script>She said to him,
“Not so, because this great wrong in sending me away is worse than the
other that you did to me!”
<p>But he would not listen to her. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,17);</script>Then he called his servant who
ministered to him, and said, “Put now this woman out from me, and bolt
the door after her.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,18);</script>She had a garment of various
colors on her; for with such robes were the king’s daughters who were
virgins dressed. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door
after her. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,19);</script>Tamar put
ashes on her head, and tore her garment of various colors that was on her;
and she laid her hand on her head, and went her way, crying aloud as she
went. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,20);</script>Absalom her
brother said to her, “Has Amnon your brother been with you? But now hold
your peace, my sister. He is your brother. Don’t take this thing to
heart.”
<p>So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom’s house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,21);</script>But when king David heard of all
these things, he was very angry. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,22);</script>Absalom spoke to Amnon neither
good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister
Tamar. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,23);</script>It happened after
two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal Hazor, which is
beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king’s sons. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,24);</script>Absalom came to the king, and
said, “See now, your servant has sheepshearers. Please let the king and
his servants go with your servant.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,25);</script>The king said to
Absalom, “No, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome to
you.” He pressed him; however he would not go, but blessed him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,26);</script>Then Absalom said, “If not,
please let my brother Amnon go with us.”
<p>The king said to him, “Why should he go with you?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,27);</script>But Absalom pressed
him, and he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,28);</script>Absalom commanded his servants,
saying, “Mark now, when Amnon’s heart is merry with wine; and when I
tell you, ‘Strike Amnon,’ then kill him. Don’t be afraid. Haven’t
I commanded you? Be courageous, and be valiant!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,29);</script>The servants of
Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king’s sons
arose, and every man got up on his mule, and fled. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,30);</script>It happened, while they were in
the way, that the news came to David, saying, “Absalom has slain all the
king’s sons, and there is not one of them left!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,31);</script>Then the king arose,
and tore his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by
with their clothes torn. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,32);</script>Jonadab, the son of Shimeah,
David’s brother, answered, “Don’t let my lord suppose that they have
killed all the young men the king’s sons; for Amnon only is dead; for by
the appointment of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he
forced his sister Tamar. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,33);</script>Now therefore don’t let my
lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king’s
sons are dead; for Amnon only is dead.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,34);</script>But Absalom fled. The young man
who kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, many people
were coming by way of the hillside behind him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,35);</script>Jonadab said to the king,
“Behold, the king’s sons are coming! It is as your servant said.”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,36);</script>It happened, as soon as
he had finished speaking, that behold, the king’s sons came, and lifted
up their voice, and wept. The king also and all his servants wept
bitterly. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,37);</script>But Absalom
fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur, king of Geshur. David mourned
for his son every day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,38);</script>So Absalom fled, and went to
Geshur, and was there three years. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,39);</script>King David longed to go forth to
Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, since he was dead.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,1);</script>Now Joab the son of
Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart was toward Absalom. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,2);</script>Joab sent to Tekoa, and fetched
there a wise woman, and said to her, “Please act like a mourner, and put
on mourning clothing, please, and don’t anoint yourself with oil, but be
as a woman who has mourned a long time for the dead. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,3);</script>Go in to the king, and speak like
this to him.” So Joab put the words in her mouth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,4);</script>When the woman of Tekoa spoke to
the king, she fell on her face to the ground, showed respect, and said,
“Help, O king!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,5);</script>The king said to her,
“What ails you?”
<p>She answered, “Truly I am a widow, and my husband is dead. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,6);</script>Your handmaid had two sons, and
they both fought together in the field, and there was no one to part them,
but the one struck the other, and killed him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,7);</script>Behold, the whole family has
risen against your handmaid, and they say, ‘Deliver him who struck his
brother, that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he killed,
and so destroy the heir also.’ Thus they would quench my coal which is
left, and would leave to my husband neither name nor remainder on the
surface of the earth.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,8);</script>The king said to the
woman, “Go to your house, and I will give a command concerning you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,9);</script>The woman of Tekoa
said to the king, “My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my
father’s house; and the king and his throne be guiltless.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,10);</script>The king said,
“Whoever says anything to you, bring him to me, and he shall not touch
you any more.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,11);</script>Then she said,
“Please let the king remember Yahweh your God, that the avenger of blood
destroy not any more, lest they destroy my son.”
<p>He said, “As Yahweh lives, not one hair of your son shall fall to the
earth.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,12);</script>Then the woman said,
“Please let your handmaid speak a word to my lord the king.”
<p>He said, “Say on.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,13);</script>The woman said,
“Why then have you devised such a thing against the people of God? For
in speaking this word the king is as one who is guilty, in that the king
does not bring home again his banished one. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,14);</script>For we must die, and are as
water split on the ground, which can’t be gathered up again; neither
does God take away life, but devises means, that he who is banished not be
an outcast from him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,15);</script>Now
therefore seeing that I have come to speak this word to my lord the king,
it is because the people have made me afraid: and your handmaid said, ‘I
will now speak to the king; it may be that the king will perform the
request of his servant.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,16);</script>For the king will hear, to
deliver his servant out of the hand of the man who would destroy me and my
son together out of the inheritance of God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,17);</script>Then your handmaid said,
‘Please let the word of my lord the king bring rest; for as an angel of
God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad. May Yahweh, your God,
be with you.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,18);</script>Then the king
answered the woman, “Please don’t hide anything from me that I ask
you.”
<p>The woman said, “Let my lord the king now speak.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,19);</script>The king said, “Is
the hand of Joab with you in all this?”
<p>The woman answered, “As your soul lives, my lord the king, no one can
turn to the right hand or to the left from anything that my lord the king
has spoken; for your servant Joab, he urged me, and he put all these words
in the mouth of your handmaid; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,20);</script>to change the face of the matter
has your servant Joab done this thing. My lord is wise, according to the
wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,21);</script>The king said to
Joab, “Behold now, I have done this thing. Go therefore, bring the young
man Absalom back.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,22);</script>Joab fell to the
ground on his face, showed respect, and blessed the king. Joab said,
“Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, my
lord, king, in that the king has performed the request of his servant.”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(14,23);</script>So Joab arose and went
to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,24);</script>The king said, “Let him return
to his own house, but let him not see my face.” So Absalom returned to
his own house, and didn’t see the king’s face. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,25);</script>Now in all Israel there was none
to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot
even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,26);</script>When he cut the hair of his head
(now it was at every year’s end that he cut it; because it was heavy on
him, therefore he cut it); he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred
shekels, after the king’s weight. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,27);</script>To Absalom there were born three
sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a
beautiful face. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,28);</script>Absalom
lived two full years in Jerusalem; and he didn’t see the king’s face.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(14,29);</script>Then Absalom sent for
Joab, to send him to the king; but he would not come to him: and he sent
again a second time, but he would not come. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,30);</script>Therefore he said to his
servants, “Behold, Joab’s field is near mine, and he has barley there.
Go and set it on fire.” Absalom’s servants set the field on fire.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,31);</script>Then Joab arose, and
came to Absalom to his house, and said to him, “Why have your servants
set my field on fire?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,32);</script>Absalom answered
Joab, “Behold, I sent to you, saying, ‘Come here, that I may send you
to the king, to say, “Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better
for me to be there still. Now therefore let me see the king’s face; and
if there is iniquity in me, let him kill me.”’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,33);</script>So Joab came to the
king, and told him; and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the
king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the
king kissed Absalom.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,1);</script>It happened after
this, that Absalom prepared him a chariot and horses, and fifty men to run
before him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,2);</script>Absalom rose
up early, and stood beside the way of the gate. It was so, that when any
man had a suit which should come to the king for judgment, then Absalom
called to him, and said, “What city are you from?”
<p>He said, “Your servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,3);</script>Absalom said to him,
“Behold, your matters are good and right; but there is no man deputized
by the king to hear you.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,4);</script>Absalom said moreover, “Oh that
I were made judge in the land, that every man who has any suit or cause
might come to me, and I would do him justice!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,5);</script>It was so, that when any man came
near to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took hold of him, and
kissed him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,6);</script>Absalom did
this sort of thing to all Israel who came to the king for judgment. So
Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,7);</script>It happened at the end of forty
years, that Absalom said to the king, “Please let me go and pay my vow,
which I have vowed to Yahweh, in Hebron. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,8);</script>For your servant vowed a vow
while I stayed at Geshur in Syria, saying, ‘If Yahweh shall indeed bring
me again to Jerusalem, then I will serve Yahweh.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,9);</script>The king said to him,
“Go in peace.”
<p>So he arose, and went to Hebron. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,10);</script>But Absalom sent spies
throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, “As soon as you hear the
sound of the trumpet, then you shall say, ‘Absalom is king in
Hebron!’” <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,11);</script>Two
hundred men went with Absalom out of Jerusalem, who were invited, and went
in their simplicity; and they didn’t know anything. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,12);</script>Absalom sent for Ahithophel the
Gilonite, David’s counselor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he
was offering the sacrifices. The conspiracy was strong; for the people
increased continually with Absalom. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,13);</script>A messenger came to David,
saying, “The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,14);</script>David said to all his
servants who were with him at Jerusalem, “Arise, and let us flee; for
else none of us shall escape from Absalom. Make speed to depart, lest he
overtake us quickly, and bring down evil on us, and strike the city with
the edge of the sword.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,15);</script>The king’s servants
said to the king, “Behold, your servants are ready to do whatever my
lord the king chooses.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,16);</script>The king went forth,
and all his household after him. The king left ten women, who were
concubines, to keep the house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,17);</script>The king went forth, and all the
people after him; and they stayed in Beth Merhak. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,18);</script>All his servants passed on
beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the
Gittites, six hundred men who came after him from Gath, passed on before
the king. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,19);</script>Then the king
said to Ittai the Gittite, “Why do you also go with us? Return, and stay
with the king; for you are a foreigner, and also an exile. Return to your
own place. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,20);</script>Whereas you
came but yesterday, should I this day make you go up and down with us,
since I go where I may? Return, and take back your brothers. Mercy and
truth be with you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,21);</script>Ittai answered the
king, and said, “As Yahweh lives, and as my lord the king lives, surely
in what place my lord the king shall is, whether for death or for life,
even there also will your servant be.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,22);</script>David said to Ittai,
“Go and pass over.” Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men,
and all the little ones who were with him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,23);</script>All the country wept with a loud
voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over
the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the
wilderness. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,24);</script>Behold,
Zadok also came, and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the
covenant of God; and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up,
until all the people finished passing out of the city. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,25);</script>The king said to Zadok, “Carry
back the ark of God into the city. If I find favor in the eyes of Yahweh,
he will bring me again, and show me both it, and his habitation; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,26);</script>but if he say thus, ‘I have no
delight in you;’ behold, here am I. Let him do to me as seems good to
him.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,27);</script>The king said
also to Zadok the priest, “Aren’t you a seer? Return into the city in
peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son
of Abiathar. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,28);</script>Behold, I
will stay at the fords of the wilderness, until word comes from you to
inform me.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,29);</script>Zadok
therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem; and they
stayed there. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,30);</script>David went
up by the ascent of the Mount of Olives, and wept as he went up; and he
had his head covered, and went barefoot: and all the people who were with
him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(15,31);</script>Someone told David,
saying, “Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.”
<p>David said, “Yahweh, please turn the counsel of Ahithophel into
foolishness.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,32);</script>It happened that when
David had come to the top, where God was worshiped, behold, Hushai the
Archite came to meet him with his coat torn, and earth on his head.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(15,33);</script>David said to him, “If
you pass on with me, then you will be a burden to me; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,34);</script>but if you return to the city,
and tell Absalom, ‘I will be your servant, O king. As I have been your
father’s servant in time past, so will I now be your servant; then will
you defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,35);</script>Don’t you have Zadok and
Abiathar the priests there with you? Therefore it shall be, that whatever
thing you shall hear out of the king’s house, you shall tell it to Zadok
and Abiathar the priests. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,36);</script>Behold, they have there with
them their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok’s son, and Jonathan, Abiathar’s
son; and by them you shall send to me everything that you shall hear.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,37);</script>So Hushai, David’s
friend, came into the city; and Absalom came into Jerusalem.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,1);</script>When David was a
little past the top, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him,
with a couple of donkeys saddled, and on them two hundred loaves of bread,
and one hundred clusters of raisins, and one hundred summer fruits, and a
bottle of wine. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,2);</script>The king
said to Ziba, What do you mean by these? Ziba said, The donkeys are for
the king’s household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the
young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness
may drink. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,3);</script>The king said,
“Where is your master’s son?”
<p>Ziba said to the king, “Behold, he is staying in Jerusalem; for he
said, ‘Today the house of Israel will restore me the kingdom of my
father.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,4);</script>Then the king said to
Ziba, “Behold, all that pertains to Mephibosheth is yours.”
<p>Ziba said, “I do obeisance. Let me find favor in your sight, my lord,
O king.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,5);</script>When king David came
to Bahurim, behold, a man of the family of the house of Saul came out,
whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera. He came out, and cursed still as
he came. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,6);</script>He cast stones
at David, and at all the servants of king David, and all the people and
all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,7);</script>Shimei said when he cursed, “Be
gone, be gone, you man of blood, and base fellow! <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,8);</script>Yahweh has returned on you all
the blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned! Yahweh
has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son! Behold, you
are caught by your own mischief, because you are a man of blood!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,9);</script>Then Abishai the son
of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why should this dead dog curse my lord the
king? Please let me go over and take off his head.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,10);</script>The king said, “What have I to
do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? Because he curses, and because Yahweh
has said to him, ‘Curse David;’ who then shall say, ‘Why have you
done so?’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,11);</script>David said to
Abishai, and to all his servants, “Behold, my son, who came forth from
my bowels, seeks my life. How much more this Benjamite, now? Leave him
alone, and let him curse; for Yahweh has invited him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,12);</script>It may be that Yahweh will look
on the wrong done to me, and that Yahweh will repay me good for the
cursing of me today.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,13);</script>So David and his men went by the
way; and Shimei went along on the hillside opposite him, and cursed as he
went, threw stones at him, and threw dust. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,14);</script>The king, and all the people who
were with him, came weary; and he refreshed himself there. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,15);</script>Absalom, and all the people, the
men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,16);</script>It happened, when Hushai the
Archite, David’s friend, had come to Absalom, that Hushai said to
Absalom, “Long live the king! Long live the king!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,17);</script>Absalom said to
Hushai, “Is this your kindness to your friend? Why didn’t you go with
your friend?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,18);</script>Hushai said to
Absalom, “No; but whomever Yahweh, and this people, and all the men of
Israel have chosen, his will I be, and with him I will stay. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,19);</script>Again, whom should I serve?
Shouldn’t I serve in the presence of his son? As I have served in your
father’s presence, so will I be in your presence.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,20);</script>Then Absalom said to
Ahithophel, “Give your counsel what we shall do.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,21);</script>Ahithophel said to
Absalom, “Go in to your father’s concubines, that he has left to keep
the house. Then all Israel will hear that you are abhorred by your father.
Then the hands of all who are with you will be strong.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,22);</script>So they spread
Absalom a tent on the top of the house; and Absalom went in to his
father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,23);</script>The counsel of Ahithophel, which
he gave in those days, was as if a man inquired at the oracle of God: so
was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,1);</script>Moreover Ahithophel
said to Absalom, “Let me now choose twelve thousand men, and I will
arise and pursue after David tonight. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,2);</script>I will come on him while he is
weary and exhausted, and will make him afraid. All the people who are with
him shall flee. I will strike the king only; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,3);</script>and I will bring back all the
people to you. The man whom you seek is as if all returned. All the people
shall be in peace.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,4);</script>The saying pleased
Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,5);</script>Then Absalom said, “Now call
Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he says.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,6);</script>When Hushai had come
to Absalom, Absalom spoke to him, saying, “Ahithophel has spoken like
this. Shall we do what he says? If not, speak up.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,7);</script>Hushai said to
Absalom, “The counsel that Ahithophel has given this time is not
good.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,8);</script>Hushai said
moreover, “You know your father and his men, that they are mighty men,
and they are fierce in their minds, like a bear robbed of her cubs in the
field. Your father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(17,9);</script>Behold, he is now hidden
in some pit, or in some other place. It will happen, when some of them
have fallen at the first, that whoever hears it will say, ‘There is a
slaughter among the people who follow Absalom!’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,10);</script>Even he who is valiant, whose
heart is as the heart of a lion, will utterly melt; for all Israel knows
that your father is a mighty man, and those who are with him are valiant
men. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,11);</script>But I counsel that
all Israel be gathered together to you, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the
sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that you go to battle in your
own person. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,12);</script>So shall we
come on him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light on
him as the dew falls on the ground; and of him and of all the men who are
with him we will not leave so much as one. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,13);</script>Moreover, if he be gone into a
city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it
into the river, until there isn’t one small stone found there.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,14);</script>Absalom and all the
men of Israel said, “The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than
the counsel of Ahithophel.” For Yahweh had ordained to defeat the good
counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that Yahweh might bring evil on
Absalom. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,15);</script>Then Hushai
said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, “Ahithophel counseled Absalom
and the elders of Israel that way; and I have counseled this way. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,16);</script>Now therefore send quickly, and
tell David, saying, ‘Don’t lodge this night at the fords of the
wilderness, but by all means pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and
all the people who are with him.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,17);</script>Now Jonathan and
Ahimaaz were staying by En Rogel; and a female servant used to go and tell
them; and they went and told king David. For they might not be seen to
come into the city. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,18);</script>But
a boy saw them, and told Absalom. Then they both went away quickly, and
came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and
they went down there. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,19);</script>The woman took and spread the
covering over the well’s mouth, and spread out bruised grain on it; and
nothing was known. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,20);</script>Absalom’s servants came to the
woman to the house; and they said, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?”
<p>The woman said to them, “They have gone over the brook of water.”
<p>When they had sought and could not find them, they returned to
Jerusalem. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,21);</script>It happened,
after they had departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and
told king David; and they said to David, “Arise and pass quickly over
the water; for thus has Ahithophel counseled against you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,22);</script>Then David arose, and
all the people who were with him, and they passed over the Jordan. By the
morning light there lacked not one of them who had not gone over the
Jordan. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,23);</script>When Ahithophel
saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his donkey, and arose,
and went home, to his city, and set his house in order, and hanged
himself; and he died, and was buried in the tomb of his father. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,24);</script>Then David came to Mahanaim.
Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(17,25);</script>Absalom set Amasa over
the army instead of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man, whose name was
Ithra the Israelite, who went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister
to Zeruiah, Joab’s mother. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,26);</script>Israel and Absalom encamped in
the land of Gilead. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,27);</script>It
happened, when David had come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of
Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar,
and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,28);</script>brought beds, basins, earthen
vessels, wheat, barley, meal, parched grain, beans, lentils, roasted
grain, <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,29);</script>honey, butter,
sheep, and cheese of the herd, for David, and for the people who were with
him, to eat: for they said, “The people are hungry, and weary, and
thirsty, in the wilderness.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,1);</script>David numbered the
people who were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of
hundreds over them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,2);</script>David
sent forth the people, a third part under the hand of Joab, and a third
part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, and a
third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. The king said to the
people, “I will surely go forth with you myself also.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,3);</script>But the people said,
“You shall not go forth; for if we flee away, they will not care for us;
neither if half of us die, will they care for us. But you are worth ten
thousand of us. Therefore now it is better that you are ready to help us
out of the city.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,4);</script>The king said to them,
“I will do what seems best to you.”
<p>The king stood beside the gate, and all the people went out by hundreds
and by thousands. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,5);</script>The
king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, “Deal gently for my
sake with the young man, even with Absalom.” All the people heard when
the king commanded all the captains concerning Absalom.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,6);</script>So the people went out
into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the forest of
Ephraim. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,7);</script>The people of
Israel were struck there before the servants of David, and there was a
great slaughter there that day of twenty thousand men. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,8);</script>For the battle was there spread
over the surface of all the country; and the forest devoured more people
that day than the sword devoured. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,9);</script>Absalom happened to meet the
servants of David. Absalom was riding on his mule, and the mule went under
the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and
he was taken up between the sky and earth; and the mule that was under him
went on. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,10);</script>A certain man
saw it, and told Joab, and said, “Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an
oak.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,11);</script>Joab said to the man
who told him, “Behold, you saw it, and why didn’t you strike him there
to the ground? I would have given you ten pieces of silver, and a sash.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,12);</script>The man said to Joab,
“Though I should receive a thousand pieces of silver in my hand, I still
wouldn’t put forth my hand against the king’s son; for in our hearing
the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, ‘Beware that none
touch the young man Absalom.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,13);</script>Otherwise if I had dealt falsely
against his life (and there is no matter hidden from the king), then you
yourself would have set yourself against me.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,14);</script>Then Joab said,
“I’m not going to wait like this with you.” He took three darts in
his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet
alive in the midst of the oak. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,15);</script>Ten young men who bore Joab’s
armor surrounded and struck Absalom, and killed him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,16);</script>Joab blew the trumpet, and the
people returned from pursuing after Israel; for Joab held back the people.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,17);</script>They took Absalom, and
cast him into the great pit in the forest, and raised over him a very
great heap of stones. Then all Israel fled everyone to his tent. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,18);</script>Now Absalom in his lifetime had
taken and reared up for himself the pillar, which is in the king’s dale;
for he said, “I have no son to keep my name in memory.” He called the
pillar after his own name; and it is called Absalom’s monument, to this
day. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,19);</script>Then Ahimaaz the
son of Zadok said, “Let me now run, and bear the king news, how that
Yahweh has avenged him of his enemies.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,20);</script>Joab said to him,
“You shall not be the bearer of news this day, but you shall bear news
another day. But today you shall bear no news, because the king’s son is
dead.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,21);</script>Then Joab said to the
Cushite, “Go, tell the king what you have seen!” The Cushite bowed
himself to Joab, and ran.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,22);</script>Then Ahimaaz the son
of Zadok said yet again to Joab, “But come what may, please let me also
run after the Cushite.”
<p>Joab said, “Why do you want to run, my son, since that you will have
no reward for the news?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,23);</script>“But come what
may,” he said, “I will run.”
<p>He said to him, “Run!” Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Plain,
and outran the Cushite.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,24);</script>Now David was sitting
between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate to
the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, a man running
alone. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,25);</script>The watchman
cried, and told the king. The king said, “If he is alone, there is news
in his mouth.” He came closer and closer.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,26);</script>The watchman saw
another man running; and the watchman called to the porter, and said,
“Behold, a man running alone!”
<p>The king said, “He also brings news.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,27);</script>The watchman said,
“I think the running of the first one is like the running of Ahimaaz the
son of Zadok.”
<p>The king said, “He is a good man, and comes with good news.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,28);</script>Ahimaaz called, and
said to the king, “All is well.” He bowed himself before the king with
his face to the earth, and said, “Blessed is Yahweh your God, who has
delivered up the men who lifted up their hand against my lord the king!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,29);</script>The king said, “Is
it well with the young man Absalom?”
<p>Ahimaaz answered, “When Joab sent the king’s servant, even me your
servant, I saw a great tumult, but I don’t know what it was.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,30);</script>The king said,
“Turn aside, and stand here.” He turned aside, and stood still.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,31);</script>Behold, the Cushite
came. The Cushite said, “News for my lord the king; for Yahweh has
avenged you this day of all those who rose up against you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,32);</script>The king said to the
Cushite, “Is it well with the young man Absalom?”
<p>The Cushite answered, “May the enemies of my lord the king, and all
who rise up against you to do you harm, be as that young man is.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,33);</script>The king was much
moved, and went up to the room over the gate, and wept. As he went, he
said, “My son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! I wish I had died for
you, Absalom, my son, my son!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,1);</script>It was told Joab,
“Behold, the king weeps and mourns for Absalom.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,2);</script>The victory that day was turned
into mourning to all the people; for the people heard it said that day,
“The king grieves for his son.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,3);</script>The people sneaked
into the city that day, as people who are ashamed steal away when they
flee in battle. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,4);</script>The king
covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, “My son Absalom,
Absalom, my son, my son!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,5);</script>Joab came into the
house to the king, and said, “You have shamed this day the faces of all
your servants, who this day have saved your life, and the lives of your
sons and of your daughters, and the lives of your wives, and the lives of
your concubines; <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,6);</script>in that
you love those who hate you, and hate those who love you. For you have
declared this day, that princes and servants are nothing to you. For today
I perceive that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then
it would have pleased you well. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,7);</script>Now therefore arise, go out, and
speak to comfort your servants; for I swear by Yahweh, if you don’t go
out, not a man will stay with you this night. That would be worse to you
than all the evil that has happened to you from your youth until now.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,8);</script>Then the king arose,
and sat in the gate. They told to all the people, saying, “Behold, the
king is sitting in the gate.” All the people came before the king. Now
Israel had fled every man to his tent. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,9);</script>All the people were at strife
throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, “The king delivered us out
of the hand of our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the
Philistines; and now he has fled out of the land from Absalom. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,10);</script>Absalom, whom we anointed over
us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why don’t you speak a word of
bringing the king back?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,11);</script>King David sent to
Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, “Speak to the elders of
Judah, saying, ‘Why are you the last to bring the king back to his
house? Since the speech of all Israel has come to the king, to return him
to his house. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,12);</script>You are my
brothers, you are my bone and my flesh. Why then are you the last to bring
back the king?’ <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,13);</script>Say to
Amasa, ‘Aren’t you my bone and my flesh? God do so to me, and more
also, if you aren’t captain of the army before me continually in the
room of Joab.’” <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,14);</script>He
bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as one man; so that they
sent to the king, saying, “Return, you and all your servants.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,15);</script>So the king returned,
and came to the Jordan. Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to
bring the king over the Jordan. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,16);</script>Shimei the son of Gera, the
Benjamite, who was of Bahurim, hurried and came down with the men of Judah
to meet king David. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,17);</script>There were a thousand men of
Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his
fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went through the
Jordan in the presence of the king. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,18);</script>A ferry boat went to bring over
the king’s household, and to do what he thought good. Shimei the son of
Gera fell down before the king, when he had come over the Jordan. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,19);</script>He said to the king, “Don’t
let my lord impute iniquity to me, nor remember that which your servant
did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that
the king should take it to his heart. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,20);</script>For your servant knows that I
have sinned. Therefore behold, I have come this day the first of all the
house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,21);</script>But Abishai the son
of Zeruiah answered, “Shall Shimei not be put to death for this, because
he cursed Yahweh’s anointed?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,22);</script>David said, “What
have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah, that you should this day be
adversaries to me? Shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel?
For don’t I know that I am this day king over Israel?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,23);</script>The king said to Shimei, “You
shall not die.” The king swore to him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,24);</script>Mephibosheth the son
of Saul came down to meet the king; and he had neither groomed his feet,
nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king
departed until the day he came home in peace. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,25);</script>It happened, when he had come to
Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said to him, “Why didn’t you
go with me, Mephibosheth?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,26);</script>He answered, “My
lord, O king, my servant deceived me. For your servant said, I will saddle
me a donkey, that I may ride thereon, and go with the king; because your
servant is lame. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,27);</script>He has
slandered your servant to my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an
angel of God. Do therefore what is good in your eyes. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,28);</script>For all my father’s house were
but dead men before my lord the king; yet you set your servant among those
who ate at your own table. What right therefore have I yet that I should
cry any more to the king?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,29);</script>The king said to him,
“Why do you speak any more of your matters? I say, you and Ziba divide
the land.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,30);</script>Mephibosheth said to
the king, “Yes, let him take all, because my lord the king has come in
peace to his own house.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,31);</script>Barzillai the Gileadite came
down from Rogelim; and he went over the Jordan with the king, to conduct
him over the Jordan. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,32);</script>Now
Barzillai was a very aged man, even eighty years old: and he had provided
the king with sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great
man. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,33);</script>The king said to
Barzillai, “Come over with me, and I will sustain you with me in
Jerusalem.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,34);</script>Barzillai
said to the king, “How many are the days of the years of my life, that I
should go up with the king to Jerusalem? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,35);</script>I am this day eighty years old.
Can I discern between good and bad? Can your servant taste what I eat or
what I drink? Can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing
women? Why then should your servant be yet a burden to my lord the king?
<script type="text/javascript">cb(19,36);</script>Your servant would but
just go over the Jordan with the king. Why should the king repay me with
such a reward? <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,37);</script>Please
let your servant turn back again, that I may die in my own city, by the
grave of my father and my mother. But behold, your servant Chimham; let
him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good to
you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,38);</script>The king answered,
“Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall
seem good to you. Whatever you require of me, that I will do for you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,39);</script>All the people went
over the Jordan, and the king went over. Then the king kissed Barzillai,
and blessed him; and he returned to his own place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,40);</script>So the king went over to Gilgal,
and Chimham went over with him. All the people of Judah brought the king
over, and also half the people of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,41);</script>Behold, all the men of Israel
came to the king, and said to the king, “Why have our brothers the men
of Judah stolen you away, and brought the king, and his household, over
the Jordan, and all David’s men with him?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,42);</script>All the men of Judah
answered the men of Israel, “Because the king is a close relative to us.
Why then are you angry about this matter? Have we eaten at all at the
king’s cost? Or has he given us any gift?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,43);</script>The men of Israel
answered the men of Judah, and said, “We have ten parts in the king, and
we have also more claim to David than you. Why then did you despise us,
that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king?” The
words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,1);</script>There happened to be
there a base fellow, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite:
and he blew the trumpet, and said, “We have no portion in David, neither
have we inheritance in the son of Jesse. Every man to his tents, Israel!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,2);</script>So all the men of
Israel went up from following David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri;
but the men of Judah joined with their king, from the Jordan even to
Jerusalem. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,3);</script>David came to
his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines,
whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in custody, and provided
them with sustenance, but didn’t go in to them. So they were shut up to
the day of their death, living in widowhood.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,4);</script>Then the king said to
Amasa, “Call me the men of Judah together within three days, and be here
present.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,5);</script>So Amasa went to call
the men of Judah together; but he stayed longer than the set time which he
had appointed him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,6);</script>David
said to Abishai, “Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than
Absalom did. Take your lord’s servants, and pursue after him, lest he
get himself fortified cities, and escape out of our sight.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,7);</script>There went out after
him Joab’s men, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and all the
mighty men; and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son
of Bichri. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,8);</script>When they were
at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Joab was
clothed in his apparel of war that he had put on, and on it was a sash
with a sword fastened on his waist in its sheath; and as he went forth it
fell out. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,9);</script>Joab said to
Amasa, “Is it well with you, my brother?” Joab took Amasa by the beard
with his right hand to kiss him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,10);</script>But Amasa took no heed to the
sword that was in Joab’s hand. So he struck him with it in the body, and
shed out his bowels to the ground, and didn’t strike him again; and he
died. Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(20,11);</script>There stood by him one
of Joab’s young men, and said, “He who favors Joab, and he who is for
David, let him follow Joab!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,12);</script>Amasa lay wallowing
in his blood in the midst of the highway. When the man saw that all the
people stood still, he carried Amasa out of the highway into the field,
and cast a garment over him, when he saw that everyone who came by him
stood still. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,13);</script>When he was
removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue
after Sheba the son of Bichri. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,14);</script>He went through all the tribes
of Israel to Abel, and to Beth Maacah, and all the Berites: and they were
gathered together, and went also after him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,15);</script>They came and besieged him in
Abel of Beth Maacah, and they cast up a mound against the city, and it
stood against the rampart; and all the people who were with Joab battered
the wall, to throw it down. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,16);</script>Then a wise woman cried out of
the city, “Hear, hear! Please say to Joab, ‘Come near here, that I may
speak with you.’” <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,17);</script>He
came near to her; and the woman said, “Are you Joab?”
<p>He answered, “I am.”
<p>Then she said to him, “Hear the words of your handmaid.”
<p>He answered, “I do hear.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,18);</script>Then she spoke,
saying, “They were used to say in old times, ‘They shall surely ask
counsel at Abel;’ and so they settled it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,19);</script>I am among those who are
peaceable and faithful in Israel. You seek to destroy a city and a mother
in Israel. Why will you swallow up the inheritance of Yahweh?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,20);</script>Joab answered, “Far
be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,21);</script>The matter is not so. But a man
of the hill country of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has
lifted up his hand against the king, even against David. Deliver him only,
and I will depart from the city.”
<p>The woman said to Joab, “Behold, his head shall be thrown to you over
the wall.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,22);</script>Then the woman went
to all the people in her wisdom. They cut off the head of Sheba the son of
Bichri, and threw it out to Joab. He blew the trumpet, and they were
dispersed from the city, every man to his tent. Joab returned to Jerusalem
to the king. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,23);</script>Now Joab
was over all the army of Israel; and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over
the Cherethites and over the Pelethites; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,24);</script>and Adoram was over the men
subject to forced labor; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the
recorder; <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,25);</script>and Sheva was
scribe; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,26);</script>and also Ira the Jairite was
chief minister to David.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,1);</script>There was a famine in
the days of David three years, year after year; and David sought the face
of Yahweh. Yahweh said, “It is for Saul, and for his bloody house,
because he put to death the Gibeonites.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,2);</script>The king called the
Gibeonites, and said to them (now the Gibeonites were not of the children
of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel
had sworn to them: and Saul sought to kill them in his zeal for the
children of Israel and Judah); <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,3);</script>and David said to the Gibeonites,
“What shall I do for you? And with what shall I make atonement, that you
may bless the inheritance of Yahweh?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,4);</script>The Gibeonites said to
him, “It is no matter of silver or gold between us and Saul, or his
house; neither is it for us to put any man to death in Israel.”
<p>He said, “Whatever you say, that will I do for you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,5);</script>They said to the king,
“The man who consumed us, and who devised against us, that we should be
destroyed from remaining in any of the borders of Israel, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,6);</script>let seven men of his sons be
delivered to us, and we will hang them up to Yahweh in Gibeah of Saul, the
chosen of Yahweh.”
<p>The king said, “I will give them.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,7);</script>But the king spared
Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of Yahweh’s
oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(21,8);</script>But the king took the two
sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and
Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she
bore to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,9);</script>He delivered them into the hands
of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the mountain before Yahweh, and
all seven of them fell together. They were put to death in the days of
harvest, in the first days, at the beginning of barley harvest. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,10);</script>Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took
sackcloth, and spread it for her on the rock, from the beginning of
harvest until water was poured on them from the sky. She allowed neither
the birds of the sky to rest on them by day, nor the animals of the field
by night. <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,11);</script>It was told
David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(21,12);</script>David went and took the
bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh
Gilead, who had stolen them from the street of Beth Shan, where the
Philistines had hanged them, in the day that the Philistines killed Saul
in Gilboa; <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,13);</script>and he
brought up from there the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son:
and they gathered the bones of those who were hanged. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,14);</script>They buried the bones of Saul
and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zela, in the tomb of
Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. After
that God was entreated for the land. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,15);</script>The Philistines had war again
with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought
against the Philistines. David grew faint; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,16);</script>and Ishbibenob, who was of the
sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear was three hundred shekels of
brass in weight, he being armed with a new sword, thought to have slain
David. <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,17);</script>But Abishai the
son of Zeruiah helped him, and struck the Philistine, and killed him. Then
the men of David swore to him, saying, “You shall go no more out with us
to battle, that you don’t quench the lamp of Israel.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,18);</script>It came to pass after
this, that there was again war with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbecai
the Hushathite killed Saph, who was of the sons of the giant. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,19);</script>There was again war with the
Philistines at Gob; and Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim the Bethlehemite
killed Goliath the Gittite’s brother, the staff of whose spear was like
a weaver’s beam. <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,20);</script>There
was again war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had on
every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in
number; and he also was born to the giant. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,21);</script>When he defied Israel, Jonathan
the son of Shimei, David’s brother, killed him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,22);</script>These four were born to the
giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his
servants.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,1);</script>David spoke to Yahweh
the words of this song in the day that Yahweh delivered him out of the
hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,2);</script>and he said,
<dl>
<dt>“Yahweh is my rock,
<dd>my fortress,
<dd>and my deliverer, even mine;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,3);</script>God, my rock, in him
I will take refuge;
<dd>my shield, and the horn of my salvation,
<dd>my high tower, and my refuge.
<dd>My savior, you save me from violence.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,4);</script>I will call on
Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised:
<dd>So shall I be saved from my enemies.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,5);</script>For the waves of
death surrounded me.
<dd>The floods of ungodliness made me afraid.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,6);</script>The cords of <a
href="#N4">Sheol</a> were around me.
<dt>The snares of death caught me.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,7);</script>In my distress I
called on Yahweh.
<dd>Yes, I called to my God.
<dt>He heard my voice out of his temple.
<dd>My cry came into his ears.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,8);</script>Then the earth shook
and trembled.
<dd>The foundations of heaven quaked and were shaken,
<dd>because he was angry.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,9);</script>Smoke went up out of
his nostrils.
<dd>Fire out of his mouth devoured.
<dd>Coals were kindled by it.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,10);</script>He bowed the heavens
also, and came down.
<dd>Thick darkness was under his feet.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,11);</script>He rode on a cherub,
and flew.
<dd>Yes, he was seen on the wings of the wind.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,12);</script>He made darkness
pavilions around himself:
<dd>gathering of waters, and thick clouds of the skies.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,13);</script>At the brightness
before him,
<dd>coals of fire were kindled.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,14);</script>Yahweh thundered
from heaven.
<dd>The Most High uttered his voice.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,15);</script>He sent out arrows,
and scattered them;
<dd>lightning, and confused them.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,16);</script>Then the channels of
the sea appeared.
<dd>The foundations of the world were laid bare by the rebuke of Yahweh,
<dd>At the blast of the breath of his nostrils.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,17);</script>He sent from on high
and he took me.
<dd>He drew me out of many waters.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,18);</script>He delivered me from
my strong enemy,
<dd>from those who hated me, for they were too mighty for me.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,19);</script>They came on me in
the day of my calamity,
<dd>but Yahweh was my support.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,20);</script>He also brought me
out into a large place.
<dd>He delivered me, because he delighted in me.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,21);</script>Yahweh rewarded me
according to my righteousness.
<dd>He rewarded me according to the cleanness of my hands.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,22);</script>For I have kept the
ways of Yahweh,
<dd>and have not wickedly departed from my God.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,23);</script>For all his
ordinances were before me.
<dd>As for his statutes, I did not depart from them.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,24);</script>I was also perfect
toward him.
<dd>I kept myself from my iniquity.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,25);</script>Therefore Yahweh has
rewarded me according to my righteousness,
<dd>According to my cleanness in his eyesight.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,26);</script>With the merciful
you will show yourself merciful.
<dd>With the perfect man you will show yourself perfect.

<dd>The word of Yahweh is tested.
<dd>He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,32);</script>For who is God,
besides Yahweh?
<dd>Who is a rock, besides our God?
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,33);</script>God is my strong
fortress.
<dd>He makes my way perfect.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,34);</script>He makes his feet
like hinds’ feet,

<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,35);</script>He teaches my hands
to war,
<dd>so that my arms bend a bow of brass.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,36);</script>You have also given
me the shield of your salvation.
<dd>Your gentleness has made me great.

<dd>so that they can’t arise.
<dd>Yes, they have fallen under my feet.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,40);</script>For you have armed
me with strength for the battle.
<dd>You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,41);</script>You have also made
my enemies turn their backs to me,
<dd>that I might cut off those who hate me.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,42);</script>They looked, but
there was none to save;
<dd>even to Yahweh, but he didn’t answer them.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,43);</script>Then I beat them as
small as the dust of the earth.
<dd>I crushed them as the mire of the streets, and spread them abroad.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,44);</script>You also have
delivered me from the strivings of my people.
<dd>You have kept me to be the head of the nations.
<dd>A people whom I have not known will serve me.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,45);</script>The foreigners will
submit themselves to me.
<dd>As soon as they hear of me, they will obey me.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,46);</script>The foreigners will
fade away,
<dd>and will come trembling out of their close places.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,47);</script>Yahweh lives!
<dd>Blessed be my rock!
<dt>Exalted be God, the rock of my salvation,
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,48);</script>even the God who
executes vengeance for me,
<dd>who brings down peoples under me,
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,49);</script>who brings me away
from my enemies.
<dt>Yes, you lift me up above those who rise up against me.
<dd>You deliver me from the violent man.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,50);</script>Therefore I will
give thanks to you, Yahweh, among the nations.
<dd>Will sing praises to your name.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,51);</script>He gives great
deliverance to his king,
<dd>and shows loving kindness to his anointed,
<dd>to David and to his seed, forevermore.”
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,1);</script>Now these are the last
words of David.
<dl>
<dt>David the son of Jesse says,
<dd>the man who was raised on high says,
<dd>the anointed of the God of Jacob,
<dd>the sweet psalmist of Israel:
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,2);</script>“The Spirit of
Yahweh spoke by me.
<dd>His word was on my tongue.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,3);</script>The God of Israel
said,
<dd>the Rock of Israel spoke to me,
<dd>‘One who rules over men righteously,
<dd>who rules in the fear of God,
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,4);</script>shall be as the light
of the morning, when the sun rises,
<dd>a morning without clouds,
<dd>when the tender grass springs out of the earth,
<dd>through clear shining after rain.’
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,5);</script>Most certainly my
house is not so with God,
<dd>yet he has made with me an everlasting covenant,
<dd>ordered in all things, and sure,
<dd>for it is all my salvation, and all my desire,
<dd>although he doesn’t make it grow.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,6);</script>But all of the
ungodly shall be as thorns to be thrust away,
<dd>because they can’t be taken with the hand,
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,7);</script>But the man who
touches them must be armed with iron and the staff of a spear.
<dt>They shall be utterly burned with fire in their place.”
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,8);</script>These are the names of
the mighty men whom David had: Josheb Basshebeth a Tahchemonite, chief of
the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite, against eight hundred slain
at one time. <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,9);</script>After him
was Eleazar the son of Dodai the son of an Ahohite, one of the three
mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines who were there
gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,10);</script>He arose, and struck the
Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand froze to the sword; and
Yahweh worked a great victory that day; and the people returned after him
only to take spoil. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,11);</script>After him was Shammah the son of
Agee a Hararite. The Philistines were gathered together into a troop,
where there was a plot of ground full of lentils; and the people fled from
the Philistines. <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,12);</script>But he
stood in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and killed the
Philistines; and Yahweh worked a great victory. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,13);</script>Three of the thirty chief men
went down, and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam;
and the troop of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(23,14);</script>David was then in the
stronghold; and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(23,15);</script>David longed, and said,
“Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Bethlehem,
which is by the gate!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,16);</script>The three mighty men
broke through the army of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well
of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David:
but he would not drink of it, but poured it out to Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,17);</script>He said, “Be it far from me,
Yahweh, that I should do this! Isn’t it the blood of the men who went in
jeopardy of their lives?” Therefore he would not drink it. The three
mighty men did these things. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,18);</script>Abishai, the brother of Joab,
the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the three. He lifted up his spear against
three hundred and killed them, and had a name among the three. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,19);</script>Wasn’t he most honorable of
the three? therefore he was made their captain: however he didn’t attain
to the three. <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,20);</script>Benaiah
the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done
mighty deeds, he killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab: he went down also
and killed a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,21);</script>He killed an Egyptian, a goodly
man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him
with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and
killed him with his own spear. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,22);</script>Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did
these things, and had a name among the three mighty men. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,23);</script>He was more honorable than the
thirty, but he didn’t attain to the three. David set him over his guard.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(23,24);</script>Asahel the brother of
Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,25);</script>Shammah the Harodite, Elika the
Harodite, <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,26);</script>Helez the
Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,27);</script>Abiezer the Anathothite,
Mebunnai the Hushathite, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,28);</script>Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the
Netophathite, <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,29);</script>Heleb the
son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the
children of Benjamin, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,30);</script>Benaiah a Pirathonite, Hiddai of
the brooks of Gaash. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,31);</script>Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth
the Barhumite, <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,32);</script>Eliahba
the Shaalbonite, the sons of Jashen, Jonathan, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,33);</script>Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the
son of Sharar the Ararite, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,34);</script>Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai,
the son of the Maacathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(23,35);</script>Hezro the Carmelite,
Paarai the Arbite, <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,36);</script>Igal
the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,37);</script>Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the
Beerothite, armor bearers to Joab the son of Zeruiah, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,38);</script>Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the
Ithrite, <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,39);</script>Uriah the
Hittite: thirty-seven in all.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,1);</script>Again the anger of
Yahweh was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them,
saying, “Go, number Israel and Judah.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,2);</script>The king said to Joab the captain
of the army, who was with him, “Now go back and forth through all the
tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, and number the people, that
I may know the sum of the people.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,3);</script>Joab said to the king,
“Now may Yahweh your God add to the people, however many they may be,
one hundred times; and may the eyes of my lord the king see it. But why
does my lord the king delight in this thing?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,4);</script>Notwithstanding, the
king’s word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the
army. Joab and the captains of the army went out from the presence of the
king, to number the people of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,5);</script>They passed over the Jordan, and
encamped in Aroer, on the right side of the city that is in the middle of
the valley of Gad, and to Jazer: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,6);</script>then they came to Gilead, and to
the land of Tahtim Hodshi; and they came to Dan Jaan, and around to Sidon,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(24,7);</script>and came to the
stronghold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the
Canaanites; and they went out to the south of Judah, at Beersheba. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,8);</script>So when they had gone back and
forth through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine
months and twenty days. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,9);</script>Joab gave up the sum of the
numbering of the people to the king: and there were in Israel eight
hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword; and the men of Judah were
five hundred thousand men. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,10);</script>David’s heart struck him after
that he had numbered the people. David said to Yahweh, “I have sinned
greatly in that which I have done. But now, Yahweh, put away, I beg you,
the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,11);</script>When David rose up in
the morning, the word of Yahweh came to the prophet Gad, David’s seer,
saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,12);</script>“Go and speak
to David, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “I offer you three things. Choose one of
them, that I may do it to you.”’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,13);</script>So Gad came to David,
and told him, and said to him, “Shall seven years of famine come to you
in your land? Or will you flee three months before your foes while they
pursue you? Or shall there be three days’ pestilence in your land? Now
answer, and consider what answer I shall return to him who sent me.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,14);</script>David said to Gad,
“I am in distress. Let us fall now into the hand of Yahweh; for his
mercies are great. Let me not fall into the hand of man.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,15);</script>So Yahweh sent a
pestilence on Israel from the morning even to the appointed time; and
there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(24,16);</script>When the angel stretched
out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, Yahweh relented of the
disaster, and said to the angel who destroyed the people, “It is enough.
Now stay your hand.” The angel of Yahweh was by the threshing floor of
Araunah the Jebusite.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,17);</script>David spoke to Yahweh
when he saw the angel who struck the people, and said, “Behold, I have
sinned, and I have done perversely; but these sheep, what have they done?
Please let your hand be against me, and against my father’s house.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,18);</script>Gad came that day to
David, and said to him, “Go up, build an altar to Yahweh on the
threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,19);</script>David went up
according to the saying of Gad, as Yahweh commanded. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,20);</script>Araunah looked out, and saw the
king and his servants coming on toward him. Then Araunah went out, and
bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,21);</script>Araunah said, “Why has my lord
the king come to his servant?”
<p>David said, “To buy your threshing floor, to build an altar to
Yahweh, that the plague may be stopped from afflicting the people.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,22);</script>Araunah said to
David, “Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him.
Behold, the cattle for the burnt offering, and the threshing instruments
and the yokes of the oxen for the wood: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,23);</script>all this, king, does Araunah
give to the king.” Araunah said to the king, “May Yahweh your God
accept you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,24);</script>The king said to
Araunah, “No; but I will most certainly buy it from you for a price. I
will not offer burnt offerings to Yahweh my God which cost me nothing.”
So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of
silver. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,25);</script>David built an
altar to Yahweh there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So
Yahweh was entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.
