The Acts of the Apostles
</h1><p>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,1);</script>The first book I wrote,
Theophilus, concerned all that Jesus began both to do and to teach,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,2);</script>until the day in which he
was received up, after he had given commandment through the Holy Spirit to
the apostles whom he had chosen. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,3);</script>To these he also showed himself
alive after he suffered, by many proofs, appearing to them over a period
of forty days, and speaking about God’s Kingdom. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,4);</script>Being assembled together with
them, he commanded them, <span class="j">“Don’t depart from Jerusalem,
but wait for the promise of the Father, which you heard from me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(1,5);</script>For John indeed baptized in water,
but you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from
now.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,6);</script>Therefore when they had
come together, they asked him, “Lord, are you now restoring the kingdom
to Israel?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,7);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“It isn’t for you to know times or seasons which the Father
has set within his own authority. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(1,8);</script>But you will receive power when
the Holy Spirit has come upon you. You will be witnesses to me in
Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the uttermost parts of the
earth.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,9);</script>When he had said these
things, as they were looking, he was taken up, and a cloud received him
out of their sight. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,10);</script>While
they were looking steadfastly into the sky as he went, behold, two men
stood by them in white clothing, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,11);</script>who also said, “You men of
Galilee, why do you stand looking into the sky? This Jesus, who was
received up from you into the sky will come back in the same way as you
saw him going into the sky.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,12);</script>Then they returned to
Jerusalem from the mountain called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a
Sabbath day’s journey away. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,13);</script>When they had come in, they went
up into the upper room, where they were staying; that is Peter, John,
James, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James the son of
Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,14);</script>All these with one accord
continued steadfastly in prayer and supplication, along with the women,
and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,15);</script>In these days, Peter
stood up in the midst of the disciples (and the number of names was about
one hundred twenty), and said, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,16);</script>“Brothers, it was necessary
that this Scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke
before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who was guide to those who
took Jesus. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,17);</script>For he was
numbered with us, and received his portion in this ministry. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,18);</script>Now this man obtained a field
with the reward for his wickedness, and falling headlong, his body burst
open, and all his intestines gushed out. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,19);</script>It became known to everyone who
lived in Jerusalem that in their language that field was called
‘Akeldama,’ that is, ‘The field of blood.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,20);</script>For it is written in the book of
Psalms,
<dl>
<dt>‘Let his habitation be made desolate.
<dd>Let no one dwell therein;’<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N1">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p>and,
<dl>
<dt>‘Let another take his office.’<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N2">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,21);</script>“Of the men
therefore who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in
and out among us, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,22);</script>beginning from the baptism of
John, to the day that he was received up from us, of these one must become
a witness with us of his resurrection.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,23);</script>They put forward two,
Joseph called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,24);</script>They prayed, and said, “You,
Lord, who know the hearts of all men, show which one of these two you have
chosen <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,25);</script>to take part in
this ministry and apostleship from which Judas fell away, that he might go
to his own place.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,26);</script>They
drew lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias, and he was numbered with
the eleven apostles.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,1);</script>Now when the day of
Pentecost had come, they were all with one accord in one place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,2);</script>Suddenly there came from the sky a
sound like the rushing of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where
they were sitting. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,3);</script>Tongues
like fire appeared and were distributed to them, and one sat on each of
them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,4);</script>They were all filled
with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other languages, as the
Spirit gave them the ability to speak. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,5);</script>Now there were dwelling in
Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under the sky. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,6);</script>When this sound was heard, the
multitude came together, and were bewildered, because everyone heard them
speaking in his own language. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,7);</script>They were all amazed and marveled,
saying to one another, “Behold, aren’t all these who speak Galileans?
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,8);</script>How do we hear, everyone
in our own native language? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,9);</script>Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and
people from Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,10);</script>Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, the
parts of Libya around Cyrene, visitors from Rome, both Jews and
proselytes, <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,11);</script>Cretans and
Arabians: we hear them speaking in our languages the mighty works of
God!” <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,12);</script>They were all
amazed, and were perplexed, saying one to another, “What does this
mean?” <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,13);</script>Others, mocking,
said, “They are filled with new wine.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,14);</script>But Peter, standing up
with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and spoke out to them, “You men of
Judea, and all you who dwell at Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and
listen to my words. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,15);</script>For
these aren’t drunken, as you suppose, seeing it is only <a
href="#N3">the third hour of the day</a>. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,16);</script>But this is what has been spoken
through the prophet Joel:
<dl>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,17);</script>‘It will be in the
last days, says God,
<dd>that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh.
<dt>Your sons and your daughters will prophesy.
<dd>Your young men will see visions.
<dd>Your old men will dream dreams.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,18);</script>Yes, and on my
servants and on my handmaidens in those days,
<dd>I will pour out my Spirit, and they will prophesy.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,19);</script>I will show wonders
in the sky above,
<dd>and signs on the earth beneath;
<dd>blood, and fire, and billows of smoke.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,20);</script>The sun will be
turned into darkness,
<dd>and the moon into blood,
<dd>before the great and glorious day of the Lord comes.
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,21);</script>It will be, that
whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved.’<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N4">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,22);</script>“Men of Israel, hear
these words! Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved by God to you by mighty
works and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you, even
as you yourselves know, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,23);</script>him, being delivered up by the
determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken by the hand of
lawless men, crucified and killed; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,24);</script>whom God raised up, having freed
him from the agony of death, because it was not possible that he should be
held by it. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,25);</script>For David
says concerning him,
<dl>
<dt>‘I saw the Lord always before my face,
<dd>For he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,26);</script>Therefore my heart
was glad, and my tongue rejoiced.
<dd>Moreover my flesh also will dwell in hope;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,27);</script>because you will not
leave my soul in <a href="#N5">Hades</a>,
<dd>neither will you allow your Holy One to see decay.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,28);</script>You made known to me
the ways of life.
<dd>You will make me full of gladness with your presence.’<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N6">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,29);</script>“Brothers, I may
tell you freely of the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried,
and his tomb is with us to this day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,30);</script>Therefore, being a prophet, and
knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his
body, according to the flesh, he would raise up the Christ to sit on his
throne, <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,31);</script>he foreseeing
this spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was his soul
left in <a href="#N7">Hades</a>, nor did his flesh see decay. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,32);</script>This Jesus God raised up, to
which we all are witnesses. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,33);</script>Being therefore exalted by the
right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the
Holy Spirit, he has poured out this, which you now see and hear. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,34);</script>For David didn’t ascend into
the heavens, but he says himself,
<dl>
<dt>‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit by my right hand,
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,35);</script>until I make your
enemies a footstool for your feet.”’<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N8">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,36);</script>“Let all the house
of Israel therefore know certainly that God has made him both Lord and
Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,37);</script>Now when they heard
this, they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the
apostles, “Brothers, what shall we do?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,38);</script>Peter said to them,
“Repent, and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ
for the forgiveness of sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy
Spirit. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,39);</script>For the promise
is to you, and to your children, and to all who are far off, even as many
as the Lord our God will call to himself.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,40);</script>With many other words he
testified, and exhorted them, saying, “Save yourselves from this crooked
generation!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,41);</script>Then those who gladly
received his word were baptized. There were added that day about three
thousand souls. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,42);</script>They
continued steadfastly in the apostles’ teaching and fellowship, in the
breaking of bread, and prayer. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,43);</script>Fear came on every soul, and many
wonders and signs were done through the apostles. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,44);</script>All who believed were together,
and had all things in common. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,45);</script>They sold their possessions and
goods, and distributed them to all, according as anyone had need. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,46);</script>Day by day, continuing
steadfastly with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread at home,
they took their food with gladness and singleness of heart, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,47);</script>praising God, and having favor
with all the people. The Lord added to the assembly day by day those who
were being saved.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,1);</script>Peter and John were
going up into the temple at the hour of prayer, <a href="#N9">the ninth
hour</a>. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,2);</script>A certain man
who was lame from his mother’s womb was being carried, whom they laid
daily at the door of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask gifts
for the needy of those who entered into the temple. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,3);</script>Seeing Peter and John about to go
into the temple, he asked to receive gifts for the needy. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,4);</script>Peter, fastening his eyes on him,
with John, said, “Look at us.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,5);</script>He listened to them, expecting to
receive something from them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,6);</script>But Peter said, “Silver and gold
have I none, but what I have, that I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ
of Nazareth, get up and walk!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,7);</script>He took him by the right hand, and
raised him up. Immediately his feet and his ankle bones received strength.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,8);</script>Leaping up, he stood, and
began to walk. He entered with them into the temple, walking, leaping, and
praising God. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,9);</script>All the
people saw him walking and praising God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,10);</script>They recognized him, that it was
he who used to sit begging for gifts for the needy at the Beautiful Gate
of the temple. They were filled with wonder and amazement at what had
happened to him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,11);</script>As the
lame man who was healed held on to Peter and John, all the people ran
together to them in the porch that is called Solomon’s, greatly
wondering.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,12);</script>When Peter saw it, he
responded to the people, “You men of Israel, why do you marvel at this
man? Why do you fasten your eyes on us, as though by our own power or
godliness we had made him walk? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,13);</script>The God of Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Servant Jesus, whom you
delivered up, and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had determined
to release him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,14);</script>But you
denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a murderer to be granted
to you, <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,15);</script>and killed the
Prince of life, whom God raised from the dead, to which we are witnesses.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,16);</script>By faith in his name, his
name has made this man strong, whom you see and know. Yes, the faith which
is through him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you
all.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,17);</script>“Now, <a
href="#N10">brothers</a>, I know that you did this in ignorance, as did
also your rulers. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,18);</script>But the
things which God announced by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ
should suffer, he thus fulfilled.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,19);</script>“Repent therefore,
and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out, so that there may come
times of refreshing from the presence of the Lord, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,20);</script>and that he may send Christ
Jesus, who was ordained for you before, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,21);</script>whom heaven must receive until
the times of restoration of all things, which God spoke long ago by the
mouth of his holy prophets. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,22);</script>For Moses indeed said to the
fathers, ‘The Lord God will raise up a prophet for you from among your
brothers, like me. You shall listen to him in all things whatever he says
to you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,23);</script>It will be, that
every soul that will not listen to that prophet will be utterly destroyed
from among the people.’<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N11">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,24);</script>Yes, and all the prophets from
Samuel and those who followed after, as many as have spoken, they also
told of these days. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,25);</script>You
are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with
our fathers, saying to Abraham, ‘In your seed will all the families of
the earth be blessed.’<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N12">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,26);</script>God, having raised up his
servant, Jesus, sent him to you first, to bless you, in turning away
everyone of you from your wickedness.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,1);</script>As they spoke to the
people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came
to them, <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,2);</script>being upset
because they taught the people and proclaimed in Jesus the resurrection
from the dead. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,3);</script>They laid
hands on them, and put them in custody until the next day, for it was now
evening. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,4);</script>But many of those
who heard the word believed, and the number of the men came to be about
five thousand.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,5);</script>It happened in the
morning, that their rulers, elders, and scribes were gathered together in
Jerusalem. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,6);</script>Annas the high
priest was there, with Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and as many as were
relatives of the high priest. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,7);</script>When they had stood them in the
middle of them, they inquired, “By what power, or in what name, have you
done this?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,8);</script>Then Peter, filled with
the Holy Spirit, said to them, “You rulers of the people, and elders of
Israel, <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,9);</script>if we are examined
today concerning a good deed done to a crippled man, by what means this
man has been healed, <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,10);</script>be
it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of
Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the
dead, in him does this man stand here before you whole. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,11);</script>He is ‘the stone which was
regarded as worthless by you, the builders, which has become the head of
the corner.’<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N13">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,12);</script>There is salvation in none other,
for neither is there any other name under heaven, that is given among men,
by which we must be saved!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,13);</script>Now when they saw the
boldness of Peter and John, and had perceived that they were unlearned and
ignorant men, they marveled. They recognized that they had been with
Jesus. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,14);</script>Seeing the man who
was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,15);</script>But when they had commanded them
to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,16);</script>saying, “What shall we do to
these men? Because indeed a notable miracle has been done through them, as
can be plainly seen by all who dwell in Jerusalem, and we can’t deny it.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,17);</script>But so that this spreads
no further among the people, let’s threaten them, that from now on they
don’t speak to anyone in this name.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,18);</script>They called them, and commanded
them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,19);</script>But Peter and John
answered them, “Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you
rather than to God, judge for yourselves, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,20);</script>for we can’t help telling the
things which we saw and heard.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,21);</script>When they had further
threatened them, they let them go, finding no way to punish them, because
of the people; for everyone glorified God for that which was done. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,22);</script>For the man on whom this miracle
of healing was performed was more than forty years old.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,23);</script>Being let go, they
came to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and the
elders had said to them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,24);</script>When they heard it, they lifted
up their voice to God with one accord, and said, “O Lord, you are God,
who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and all that is in them; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,25);</script>who by the mouth of your servant,
David, said,
<dl>
<dt>‘Why do the nations rage,
<dd>and the peoples plot a vain thing?
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,26);</script>The kings of the
earth take a stand,
<dd>and the rulers take council together,
<dd>against the Lord, and against his <a href="#N14">Christ</a>.’<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N15">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,27);</script>“For truly, in this
city against your holy servant, Jesus, whom you anointed, both Herod and
Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, were gathered
together <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,28);</script>to do whatever
your hand and your council foreordained to happen. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,29);</script>Now, Lord, look at their threats,
and grant to your servants to speak your word with all boldness, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,30);</script>while you stretch out your hand
to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of your
holy Servant Jesus.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,31);</script>When they had prayed,
the place was shaken where they were gathered together. They were all
filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,32);</script>The multitude of those
who believed were of one heart and soul. Not one of them claimed that
anything of the things which he possessed was his own, but they had all
things in common. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,33);</script>With
great power, the apostles gave their testimony of the resurrection of the
Lord Jesus. Great grace was on them all. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,34);</script>For neither was there among them
any who lacked, for as many as were owners of lands or houses sold them,
and brought the proceeds of the things that were sold, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,35);</script>and laid them at the apostles’
feet, and distribution was made to each, according as anyone had need.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,36);</script>Joses, who by the
apostles was surnamed Barnabas (which is, being interpreted, Son of
Encouragement), a Levite, a man of Cyprus by race, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,37);</script>having a field, sold it, and
brought the money and laid it at the apostles’ feet.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,1);</script>But a certain man named
Ananias, with Sapphira, his wife, sold a possession, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,2);</script>and kept back part of the price,
his wife also being aware of it, and brought a certain part, and laid it
at the apostles’ feet. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,3);</script>But Peter said, “Ananias, why
has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back
part of the price of the land? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,4);</script>While you kept it, didn’t it
remain your own? After it was sold, wasn’t it in your power? How is it
that you have conceived this thing in your heart? You haven’t lied to
men, but to God.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,5);</script>Ananias, hearing these
words, fell down and died. Great fear came on all who heard these things.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(5,6);</script>The young men arose and
wrapped him up, and they carried him out and buried him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,7);</script>About three hours later, his wife,
not knowing what had happened, came in. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,8);</script>Peter answered her, “Tell me
whether you sold the land for so much.”
<p>She said, “Yes, for so much.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,9);</script>But Peter asked her,
“How is it that you have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the
Lord? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the
door, and they will carry you out.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,10);</script>She fell down
immediately at his feet, and died. The young men came in and found her
dead, and they carried her out and buried her by her husband. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,11);</script>Great fear came on the whole
assembly, and on all who heard these things. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,12);</script>By the hands of the apostles many
signs and wonders were done among the people. They were all with one
accord in Solomon’s porch. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,13);</script>None of the rest dared to join
them, however the people honored them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,14);</script>More believers were added to the
Lord, multitudes of both men and women. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,15);</script>They even carried out the sick
into the streets, and laid them on cots and mattresses, so that as Peter
came by, at the least his shadow might overshadow some of them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,16);</script>Multitudes also came together
from the cities around Jerusalem, bringing sick people, and those who were
tormented by unclean spirits: and they were all healed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,17);</script>But the high priest
rose up, and all those who were with him (which is the sect of the
Sadducees), and they were filled with jealousy, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,18);</script>and laid hands on the apostles,
and put them in public custody. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,19);</script>But an angel of the Lord opened
the prison doors by night, and brought them out, and said, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,20);</script>“Go stand and speak in the
temple to the people all the words of this life.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,21);</script>When they heard this,
they entered into the temple about daybreak, and taught. But the high
priest came, and those who were with him, and called the council together,
and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to
have them brought. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,22);</script>But
the officers who came didn’t find them in the prison. They returned and
reported, <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,23);</script>“We found the
prison shut and locked, and the guards standing before the doors, but when
we opened them, we found no one inside!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,24);</script>Now when the high
priest, the captain of the temple, and the chief priests heard these
words, they were very perplexed about them and what might become of this.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(5,25);</script>One came and told them,
“Behold, the men whom you put in prison are in the temple, standing and
teaching the people.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,26);</script>Then the captain went with the
officers, and brought them without violence, for they were afraid that the
people might stone them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,27);</script>When they had brought
them, they set them before the council. The high priest questioned them,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(5,28);</script>saying, “Didn’t we
strictly command you not to teach in this name? Behold, you have filled
Jerusalem with your teaching, and intend to bring this man’s blood on
us.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,29);</script>But Peter and the
apostles answered, “We must obey God rather than men. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,30);</script>The God of our fathers raised up
Jesus, whom you killed, hanging him on a tree. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,31);</script>God exalted him with his right
hand to be a Prince and a Savior, to give repentance to Israel, and
remission of sins. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,32);</script>We are
His witnesses of these things; and so also is the Holy Spirit, whom God
has given to those who obey him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,33);</script>But they, when they
heard this, were cut to the heart, and determined to kill them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,34);</script>But one stood up in the council,
a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, honored by all the
people, and commanded to put the apostles out for a little while. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,35);</script>He said to them, “You men of
Israel, be careful concerning these men, what you are about to do. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,36);</script>For before these days Theudas
rose up, making himself out to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about
four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed
him, were dispersed, and came to nothing. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,37);</script>After this man, Judas of Galilee
rose up in the days of the enrollment, and drew away some people after
him. He also perished, and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered
abroad. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,38);</script>Now I tell you,
withdraw from these men, and leave them alone. For if this counsel or this
work is of men, it will be overthrown. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,39);</script>But if it is of God, you will not
be able to overthrow it, and you would be found even to be fighting
against God!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,40);</script>They agreed with him.
Summoning the apostles, they beat them and commanded them not to speak in
the name of Jesus, and let them go. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,41);</script>They therefore departed from the
presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer
dishonor for Jesus’ name.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,42);</script>Every day, in the
temple and at home, they never stopped teaching and preaching Jesus, the
Christ.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,1);</script>Now in those days, when
the number of the disciples was multiplying, a complaint arose from the <a
href="#N16">Hellenists</a> against the Hebrews, because their widows were
neglected in the daily service. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,2);</script>The twelve summoned the multitude
of the disciples and said, “It is not appropriate for us to forsake the
word of God and serve tables. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,3);</script>Therefore select from among you,
brothers, seven men of good report, full of the Holy Spirit and of wisdom,
whom we may appoint over this business. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,4);</script>But we will continue steadfastly
in prayer and in the ministry of the word.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,5);</script>These words pleased the
whole multitude. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy
Spirit, Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a
proselyte of Antioch; <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,6);</script>whom
they set before the apostles. When they had prayed, they laid their hands
on them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,7);</script>The word of God
increased and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem
exceedingly. A great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,8);</script>Stephen, full of faith
and power, performed great wonders and signs among the people. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,9);</script>But some of those who were of the
synagogue called “The Libertines,” and of the Cyrenians, of the
Alexandrians, and of those of Cilicia and Asia arose, disputing with
Stephen. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,10);</script>They weren’t
able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,11);</script>Then they secretly induced men to
say, “We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and
God.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,12);</script>They stirred up
the people, the elders, and the scribes, and came against him and seized
him, and brought him in to the council, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,13);</script>and set up false witnesses who
said, “This man never stops speaking blasphemous words against this holy
place and the law. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,14);</script>For we
have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place,
and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,15);</script>All who sat in the council,
fastening their eyes on him, saw his face like it was the face of an angel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,1);</script>The high priest said,
“Are these things so?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,2);</script>He said, “Brothers
and fathers, listen. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when
he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,3);</script>and said to him, ‘Get out of
your land, and from your relatives, and come into a land which I will show
you.’<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N17">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,4);</script>Then he came out of the land of
the Chaldaeans, and lived in Haran. From there, when his father was dead,
God moved him into this land, where you are now living. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,5);</script>He gave him no inheritance in it,
no, not so much as to set his foot on. He promised that he would give it
to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when he still had no
child. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,6);</script>God spoke in this
way: that his seed would live as aliens in a strange land, and that they
would be enslaved and mistreated for four hundred years. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,7);</script>‘I will judge the nation to
which they will be in bondage,’ said God, ‘and after that will they
come out, and serve me in this place.’<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N18">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,8);</script>He gave him the covenant of
circumcision. So Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him
the eighth day. Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the
father of the twelve patriarchs.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,9);</script>“The patriarchs,
moved with jealousy against Joseph, sold him into Egypt. God was with him,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,10);</script>and delivered him out of
all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of
Egypt. He made him governor over Egypt and all his house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,11);</script>Now a famine came over all the
land of Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction. Our fathers found no food.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,12);</script>But when Jacob heard that
there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers the first time. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,13);</script>On the second time Joseph was
made known to his brothers, and Joseph’s race was revealed to Pharaoh.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,14);</script>Joseph sent, and summoned
Jacob, his father, and all his relatives, seventy-five souls. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,15);</script>Jacob went down into Egypt, and
he died, himself and our fathers, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,16);</script>and they were brought back to
Shechem, and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in silver
from the children of Hamor of Shechem.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,17);</script>“But as the time of
the promise came close which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and
multiplied in Egypt, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,18);</script>until there arose a different
king, who didn’t know Joseph. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,19);</script>The same took advantage of our
race, and mistreated our fathers, and forced them to throw out their
babies, so that they wouldn’t stay alive. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,20);</script>At that time Moses was born, and
was exceedingly handsome. He was nourished three months in his father’s
house. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,21);</script>When he was thrown
out, Pharaoh’s daughter took him up, and reared him as her own son.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,22);</script>Moses was instructed in
all the wisdom of the Egyptians. He was mighty in his words and works.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,23);</script>But when he was forty
years old, it came into his heart to visit his <a
href="#N19">brothers</a>, the children of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,24);</script>Seeing one of them suffer wrong,
he defended him, and avenged him who was oppressed, striking the Egyptian.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,25);</script>He supposed that his
brothers understood that God, by his hand, was giving them deliverance;
but they didn’t understand.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,26);</script>“The day following,
he appeared to them as they fought, and urged them to be at peace again,
saying, ‘Sirs, you are brothers. Why do you wrong one another?’
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,27);</script>But he who did his
neighbor wrong pushed him away, saying, ‘Who made you a ruler and a
judge over us? <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,28);</script>Do you
want to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?’<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N20">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,29);</script>Moses fled at this saying, and
became a stranger in the land of Midian, where he became the father of two
sons.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,30);</script>“When forty years
were fulfilled, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in the wilderness of
Mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a bush. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,31);</script>When Moses saw it, he wondered at
the sight. As he came close to see, a voice of the Lord came to him,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,32);</script>‘I am the God of your
fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of
Jacob.’<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N21">*</a></sup></font> Moses trembled, and dared not look. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,33);</script>The Lord said to him, ‘Take
your sandals off of your feet, for the place where you stand is holy
ground. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,34);</script>I have surely
seen the affliction of my people that is in Egypt, and have heard their
groaning. I have come down to deliver them. Now come, I will send you into
Egypt.’<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N22">*</a></sup></font>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,35);</script>“This Moses, whom
they refused, saying, ‘Who made you a ruler and a judge?’—God has
sent him as both a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel who
appeared to him in the bush. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,36);</script>This man led them out, having
worked wonders and signs in Egypt, in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness
for forty years. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,37);</script>This is
that Moses, who said to the children of Israel, ‘The Lord our God will
raise up a prophet for you from among your brothers, like me.<font

color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N24">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,38);</script>This is he who was in the
assembly in the wilderness with the angel that spoke to him on Mount
Sinai, and with our fathers, who received living oracles to give to us,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,39);</script>to whom our fathers
wouldn’t be obedient, but rejected him, and turned back in their hearts
to Egypt, <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,40);</script>saying to
Aaron, ‘Make us gods that will go before us, for as for this Moses, who
led us out of the land of Egypt, we don’t know what has become of
him.’<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a

and brought a sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their
hands. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,42);</script>But God turned,
and gave them up to serve the <a href="#N26">army of the sky,</a> as it is
written in the book of the prophets,

<dt>‘Did you offer to me slain animals and sacrifices
<dd>forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?

<dt>the figures which you made to worship.

</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,44);</script>“Our fathers had the
tabernacle of the testimony in the wilderness, even as he who spoke to
Moses commanded him to make it according to the pattern that he had seen;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,45);</script>which also our fathers,
in their turn, brought in with Joshua when they entered into the
possession of the nations, whom God drove out before the face of our
fathers, to the days of David, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,46);</script>who found favor in the sight of
God, and asked to find a habitation for the God of Jacob. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,47);</script>But Solomon built him a house.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,48);</script>However, the Most High
doesn’t dwell in temples made with hands, as the prophet says,
<dl>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,49);</script>‘heaven is my

<dt>What kind of house will you build me?’ says the Lord;
<dd>‘or what is the place of my rest?

</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,51);</script>“You stiff-necked
and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit! As
your fathers did, so you do. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,52);</script>Which of the prophets didn’t
your fathers persecute? They killed those who foretold the coming of the
Righteous One, of whom you have now become betrayers and murderers.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,53);</script>You received the law as
it was ordained by angels, and didn’t keep it!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,54);</script>Now when they heard
these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed at him with
their teeth. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,55);</script>But he,
being full of the Holy Spirit, looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw
the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,56);</script>and said, “Behold, I see the
heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,57);</script>But they cried out
with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and rushed at him with one
accord. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,58);</script>They threw him
out of the city, and stoned him. The witnesses placed their garments at
the feet of a young man named Saul. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,59);</script>They stoned Stephen as he called
out, saying, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,60);</script>He kneeled down, and cried with a
loud voice, “Lord, don’t hold this sin against them!” When he had
said this, he fell asleep.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,1);</script>Saul was consenting to
his death. A great persecution arose against the assembly which was in
Jerusalem in that day. They were all scattered abroad throughout the
regions of Judea and Samaria, except for the apostles. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,2);</script>Devout men buried Stephen, and
lamented greatly over him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,3);</script>But Saul ravaged the assembly,
entering into every house, and dragged both men and women off to prison.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,4);</script>Therefore those who were
scattered abroad went around preaching the word. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,5);</script>Philip went down to the city of
Samaria, and proclaimed to them the Christ. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,6);</script>The multitudes listened with one
accord to the things that were spoken by Philip, when they heard and saw
the signs which he did. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,7);</script>For unclean spirits came out of
many of those who had them. They came out, crying with a loud voice. Many
who had been paralyzed and lame were healed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,8);</script>There was great joy in that city.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,9);</script>But there was a certain
man, Simon by name, who used to practice sorcery in the city, and amazed
the people of Samaria, making himself out to be some great one, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,10);</script>to whom they all listened, from
the least to the greatest, saying, “This man is that great power of
God.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,11);</script>They listened to
him, because for a long time he had amazed them with his sorceries.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,12);</script>But when they believed
Philip preaching good news concerning the Kingdom of God and the name of
Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,13);</script>Simon himself also believed.
Being baptized, he continued with Philip. Seeing signs and great miracles
occurring, he was amazed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,14);</script>Now when the apostles
who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God,
they sent Peter and John to them, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,15);</script>who, when they had come down,
prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,16);</script>for as yet he had fallen on none
of them. They had only been baptized in the name of Christ Jesus. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,17);</script>Then they laid their hands on
them, and they received the Holy Spirit. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,18);</script>Now when Simon saw that the Holy
Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles’ hands, he
offered them money, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,19);</script>saying, “Give me also this
power, that whomever I lay my hands on may receive the Holy Spirit.”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,20);</script>But Peter said to him,
“May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain
the gift of God with money! <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,21);</script>You have neither part nor lot in
this matter, for your heart isn’t right before God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,22);</script>Repent therefore of this, your
wickedness, and ask God if perhaps the thought of your heart may be
forgiven you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,23);</script>For I see
that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bondage of iniquity.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,24);</script>Simon answered,
“Pray for me to the Lord, that none of the things which you have spoken
happen to me.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,25);</script>They therefore, when
they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem,
and preached the Good News to many villages of the Samaritans. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,26);</script>But an angel of the Lord spoke to
Philip, saying, “Arise, and go toward the south to the way that goes
down from Jerusalem to Gaza. This is a desert.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,27);</script>He arose and went; and
behold, there was a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under
Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had
come to Jerusalem to worship. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,28);</script>He was returning and sitting in
his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,29);</script>The Spirit said to
Philip, “Go near, and join yourself to this chariot.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,30);</script>Philip ran to him, and
heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, “Do you understand what
you are reading?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,31);</script>He said, “How can I,
unless someone explains it to me?” He begged Philip to come up and sit
with him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,32);</script>Now the passage
of the Scripture which he was reading was this,
<dl>
<dt>“He was led as a sheep to the slaughter.

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,34);</script>The eunuch answered
Philip, “Who is the prophet talking about? About himself, or about
someone else?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,35);</script>Philip opened his
mouth, and beginning from this Scripture, preached to him Jesus. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,36);</script>As they went on the way, they
came to some water, and the eunuch said, “Behold, here is water. What is
keeping me from being baptized?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,37);</script><font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N30">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,38);</script>He commanded the chariot to stand
still, and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch,
and he baptized him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,39);</script>When they came up out
of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away, and the eunuch
didn’t see him any more, for he went on his way rejoicing. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,40);</script>But Philip was found at Azotus.
Passing through, he preached the Good News to all the cities, until he
came to Caesarea.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,1);</script>But Saul, still
breathing threats and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went to
the high priest, <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,2);</script>and asked
for letters from him to the synagogues of Damascus, that if he found any
who were of the Way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to
Jerusalem. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,3);</script>As he traveled,
it happened that he got close to Damascus, and suddenly a light from the
sky shone around him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,4);</script>He
fell on the earth, and heard a voice saying to him, <span
class="j">“Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,5);</script>He said, “Who are
you, Lord?”
<p>The Lord said, <span class="j">“I am Jesus, whom you are
persecuting.<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N31">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cj(9,6);</script><a href="#N32">But</a> rise up,
and enter into the city, and you will be told what you must do.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,7);</script>The men who traveled
with him stood speechless, hearing the sound, but seeing no one. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,8);</script>Saul arose from the ground, and
when his eyes were opened, he saw no one. They led him by the hand, and
brought him into Damascus. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,9);</script>He was without sight for three
days, and neither ate nor drank.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,10);</script>Now there was a
certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a
vision, <span class="j">“Ananias!”</span>
<p>He said, “Behold, it’s me, Lord.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,11);</script>The Lord said to him,
<span class="j">“Arise, and go to the street which is called Straight,
and inquire in the house of <a href="#N33">Judah</a> for one named Saul, a
man of Tarsus. For behold, he is praying, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(9,12);</script>and in a vision he has seen a man
named Ananias coming in, and laying his hands on him, that he might
receive his sight.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,13);</script>But Ananias answered,
“Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he did to
your saints at Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,14);</script>Here he has authority from the
chief priests to bind all who call on your name.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,15);</script>But the Lord said to
him, <span class="j">“Go your way, for he is my chosen vessel to bear my
name before the nations and kings, and the children of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(9,16);</script>For I will show him how many
things he must suffer for my name’s sake.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,17);</script>Ananias departed, and
entered into the house. Laying his hands on him, he said, “Brother Saul,
the Lord, who appeared to you on the road by which you came, has sent me,
that you may receive your sight, and be filled with the Holy Spirit.”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,18);</script>Immediately something
like scales fell from his eyes, and he received his sight. He arose and
was baptized. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,19);</script>He took
food and was strengthened. Saul stayed several days with the disciples who
were at Damascus. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,20);</script>Immediately in the synagogues he
proclaimed the Christ, that he is the Son of God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,21);</script>All who heard him were amazed,
and said, “Isn’t this he who in Jerusalem made havoc of those who
called on this name? And he had come here intending to bring them bound
before the chief priests!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,22);</script>But Saul increased
more in strength, and confounded the Jews who lived at Damascus, proving
that this is the Christ. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,23);</script>When many days were fulfilled,
the Jews conspired together to kill him, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,24);</script>but their plot became known to
Saul. They watched the gates both day and night that they might kill him,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,25);</script>but his disciples took
him by night, and let him down through the wall, lowering him in a basket.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,26);</script>When Saul had come to
Jerusalem, he tried to join himself to the disciples; but they were all
afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,27);</script>But Barnabas took him, and
brought him to the apostles, and declared to them how he had seen the Lord
in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how at Damascus he had
preached boldly in the name of Jesus. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,28);</script>He was with them <a
href="#N34">entering into</a> Jerusalem, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,29);</script>preaching boldly in the name of
the Lord <a href="#N35">Jesus.</a> He spoke and disputed against the <a
href="#N36">Hellenists,</a> but they were seeking to kill him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,30);</script>When the <a
href="#N37">brothers</a> knew it, they brought him down to Caesarea, and
sent him off to Tarsus. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,31);</script>So the assemblies throughout all
Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, and were built up. They were
multiplied, walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy
Spirit.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,32);</script>It happened, as Peter
went throughout all those parts, he came down also to the saints who lived
at Lydda. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,33);</script>There he found
a certain man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years,
because he was paralyzed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,34);</script>Peter said to him, “Aeneas,
Jesus Christ heals you. Get up and make your bed!” Immediately he arose.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,35);</script>All who lived at Lydda
and in Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,36);</script>Now there was at Joppa
a certain disciple named Tabitha, which when translated, means <a
href="#N38">Dorcas.</a> This woman was full of good works and acts of
mercy which she did. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,37);</script>It
happened in those days that she fell sick, and died. When they had washed
her, they laid her in an upper room. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,38);</script>As Lydda was near Joppa, the
disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent <a href="#N39">two men</a>
to him, imploring him not to delay in coming to them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,39);</script>Peter got up and went with them.
When he had come, they brought him into the upper room. All the widows
stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas had
made while she was with them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,40);</script>Peter put them all out, and
kneeled down and prayed. Turning to the body, he said, “Tabitha, get
up!” She opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,41);</script>He gave her his hand, and raised
her up. Calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,42);</script>And it became known throughout
all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,43);</script>It happened, that he stayed many
days in Joppa with one Simon, a tanner.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,1);</script>Now there was a
certain man in Caesarea, Cornelius by name, a centurion of what was called
the Italian Regiment, <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,2);</script>a
devout man, and one who feared God with all his house, who gave gifts for
the needy generously to the people, and always prayed to God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,3);</script>At about <a href="#N40">the ninth
hour of the day</a>, he clearly saw in a vision an angel of God coming to
him, and saying to him, “Cornelius!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,4);</script>He, fastening his eyes
on him, and being frightened, said, “What is it, Lord?”
<p>He said to him, “Your prayers and your gifts to the needy have gone
up for a memorial before God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,5);</script>Now send men to Joppa, and get
Simon, who is surnamed Peter. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,6);</script>He lodges with one Simon, a
tanner, whose house is by the seaside.<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N41">*</a></sup></font>”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,7);</script>When the angel who
spoke to him had departed, Cornelius called two of his household servants
and a devout soldier of those who waited on him continually. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,8);</script>Having explained everything to
them, he sent them to Joppa. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,9);</script>Now on the next day as they were
on their journey, and got close to the city, Peter went up on the housetop
to pray at about noon. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,10);</script>He became hungry and desired to
eat, but while they were preparing, he fell into a trance. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,11);</script>He saw heaven opened and a
certain container descending to him, like a great sheet let down by four
corners on the earth, <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,12);</script>in
which were all kinds of four-footed animals of the earth, wild animals,
reptiles, and birds of the sky. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,13);</script>A voice came to him, <span
class="j">“Rise, Peter, kill and eat!”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,14);</script>But Peter said,
“Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or
unclean.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,15);</script>A voice came to him
again the second time, <span class="j">“What God has cleansed, you must
not call unclean.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,16);</script>This was done three times, and
immediately the vessel was received up into heaven. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,17);</script>Now while Peter was very
perplexed in himself what the vision which he had seen might mean, behold,
the men who were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon’s
house, stood before the gate, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,18);</script>and called and asked whether
Simon, who was surnamed Peter, was lodging there. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,19);</script>While Peter was pondering the
vision, the Spirit said to him, “Behold, <a href="#N42">three</a> men
seek you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,20);</script>But arise, get
down, and go with them, doubting nothing; for I have sent them.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,21);</script>Peter went down to
the men, and said, “Behold, I am he whom you seek. Why have you come?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,22);</script>They said,
“Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous man and one who fears God, and well
spoken of by all the nation of the Jews, was directed by a holy angel to
invite you to his house, and to listen to what you say.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,23);</script>So he called them in and lodged
them. On the next day Peter arose and went out with them, and some of the
brothers from Joppa accompanied him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,24);</script>On the next day they entered
into Caesarea. Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his
relatives and his near friends. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,25);</script>When it happened that Peter
entered, Cornelius met him, fell down at his feet, and worshiped him.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(10,26);</script>But Peter raised him up,
saying, “Stand up! I myself am also a man.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,27);</script>As he talked with him, he went
in and found many gathered together. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,28);</script>He said to them, “You
yourselves know how it is an unlawful thing for a man who is a Jew to join
himself or come to one of another nation, but God has shown me that I
shouldn’t call any man unholy or unclean. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,29);</script>Therefore also I came without
complaint when I was sent for. I ask therefore, why did you send for me?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,30);</script>Cornelius said,
“Four days ago, I was fasting until this hour, and at <a href="#N43">the
ninth hour,</a> I prayed in my house, and behold, a man stood before me in
bright clothing, <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,31);</script>and
said, ‘Cornelius, your prayer is heard, and your gifts to the needy are
remembered in the sight of God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,32);</script>Send therefore to Joppa, and
summon Simon, who is surnamed Peter. He lodges in the house of Simon a
tanner, by the seaside. When he comes, he will speak to you.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,33);</script>Therefore I sent to you at once,
and it was good of you to come. Now therefore we are all here present in
the sight of God to hear all things that have been commanded you by God.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,34);</script>Peter opened his
mouth and said, “Truly I perceive that God doesn’t show favoritism;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(10,35);</script>but in every nation he
who fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,36);</script>The word which he sent to the
children of Israel, preaching good news of peace by Jesus Christ—he is
Lord of all—<script type="text/javascript">cb(10,37);</script>you
yourselves know what happened, which was proclaimed throughout all Judea,
beginning from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,38);</script>even Jesus of Nazareth, how God
anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing
good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with
him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,39);</script>We are witnesses of
everything he did both in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom
they <a href="#N44">also</a> killed, hanging him on a tree. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,40);</script>God raised him up the third day,
and gave him to be revealed, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,41);</script>not to all the people, but to
witnesses who were chosen before by God, to us, who ate and drank with him
after he rose from the dead. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,42);</script>He commanded us to preach to the
people and to testify that this is he who is appointed by God as the Judge
of the living and the dead. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,43);</script>All the prophets testify about
him, that through his name everyone who believes in him will receive
remission of sins.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,44);</script>While Peter was still
speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all those who heard the
word. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,45);</script>They of the
circumcision who believed were amazed, as many as came with Peter, because
the gift of the Holy Spirit was also poured out on the Gentiles. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,46);</script>For they heard them speaking in
other languages and magnifying God.
<p>Then Peter answered, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,47);</script>“Can any man forbid the water,
that these who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we should not be
baptized?” <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,48);</script>He
commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked
him to stay some days.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,1);</script>Now the apostles and
the <a href="#N45">brothers</a> who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles
had also received the word of God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,2);</script>When Peter had come up to
Jerusalem, those who were of the circumcision contended with him, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,3);</script>saying, “You went in to
uncircumcised men, and ate with them!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,4);</script>But Peter began, and
explained to them in order, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,5);</script>“I was in the city of Joppa
praying, and in a trance I saw a vision: a certain container descending,
like it was a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners. It came as
far as me. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,6);</script>When I had
looked intently at it, I considered, and saw the four-footed animals of
the earth, wild animals, creeping things, and birds of the sky. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,7);</script>I also heard a voice saying to
me, <span class="j">‘Rise, Peter, kill and eat!’</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,8);</script>But I said, ‘Not so, Lord, for
nothing unholy or unclean has ever entered into my mouth.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,9);</script>But a voice answered me the
second time out of heaven, <span class="j">‘What God has cleansed,
don’t you call unclean.’</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,10);</script>This was done three times, and
all were drawn up again into heaven. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,11);</script>Behold, immediately three men
stood before the house where I was, having been sent from Caesarea to me.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,12);</script>The Spirit told me to go
with them, without discriminating. These six brothers also accompanied me,
and we entered into the man’s house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,13);</script>He told us how he had seen the
angel standing in his house, and saying to him, ‘Send to Joppa, and get
Simon, whose surname is Peter, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,14);</script>who will speak to you words by
which you will be saved, you and all your house.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,15);</script>As I began to speak, the Holy
Spirit fell on them, even as on us at the beginning. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,16);</script>I remembered the word of the
Lord, how he said, <span class="j">‘John indeed baptized in water, but
you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit.’</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,17);</script>If then God gave to them the
same gift as us, when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I,
that I could withstand God?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,18);</script>When they heard these
things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, “Then God has
also granted to the Gentiles repentance to life!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,19);</script>They therefore who
were scattered abroad by the oppression that arose about Stephen traveled
as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to no one
except to Jews only. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,20);</script>But
there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they had come
to Antioch, spoke to the <a href="#N46">Hellenists,</a> preaching the Lord
Jesus. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,21);</script>The hand of the
Lord was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,22);</script>The report concerning
them came to the ears of the assembly which was in Jerusalem. They sent
out Barnabas to go as far as Antioch, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,23);</script>who, when he had come, and had
seen the grace of God, was glad. He exhorted them all, that with purpose
of heart they should remain near to the Lord. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,24);</script>For he was a good man, and full
of the Holy Spirit and of faith, and many people were added to the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,25);</script>Barnabas went out to
Tarsus to look for Saul. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,26);</script>When he had found him, he
brought him to Antioch. It happened, that for a whole year they were
gathered together with the assembly, and taught many people. The disciples
were first called Christians in Antioch.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,27);</script>Now in these days,
prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,28);</script>One of them named Agabus stood
up, and indicated by the Spirit that there should be a great famine all
over the world, which also happened in the days of Claudius. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,29);</script>As any of the disciples had
plenty, each determined to send relief to the brothers who lived in Judea;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,30);</script>which they also did,
sending it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,1);</script>Now about that time,
King Herod stretched out his hands to oppress some of the assembly.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(12,2);</script>He killed James, the
brother of John, with the sword. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,3);</script>When he saw that it pleased the
Jews, he proceeded to seize Peter also. This was during the days of
unleavened bread. <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,4);</script>When he
had arrested him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four squads
of four soldiers each to guard him, intending to bring him out to the
people after the Passover. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,5);</script>Peter therefore was kept in the
prison, but constant prayer was made by the assembly to God for him.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(12,6);</script>The same night when Herod
was about to bring him out, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound
with two chains. Guards in front of the door kept the prison.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,7);</script>And behold, an angel
of the Lord stood by him, and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter
on the side, and woke him up, saying, “Stand up quickly!” His chains
fell off from his hands. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,8);</script>The angel said to him, “Get
dressed and put on your sandals.” He did so. He said to him, “Put on
your cloak, and follow me.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,9);</script>And he went out and followed him.
He didn’t know that what was being done by the angel was real, but
thought he saw a vision. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,10);</script>When they were past the first
and the second guard, they came to the iron gate that leads into the city,
which opened to them by itself. They went out, and went down one street,
and immediately the angel departed from him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,11);</script>When Peter had come
to himself, he said, “Now I truly know that the Lord has sent out his
angel and delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from everything the
Jewish people were expecting.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,12);</script>Thinking about that, he came to
the house of Mary, the mother of John whose surname was Mark, where many
were gathered together and were praying. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,13);</script>When Peter knocked at the door
of the gate, a maid named Rhoda came to answer. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,14);</script>When she recognized Peter’s
voice, she didn’t open the gate for joy, but ran in, and reported that
Peter was standing in front of the gate.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,15);</script>They said to her,
“You are crazy!” But she insisted that it was so. They said, “It is
his angel.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,16);</script>But Peter
continued knocking. When they had opened, they saw him, and were amazed.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(12,17);</script>But he, beckoning to
them with his hand to be silent, declared to them how the Lord had brought
him out of the prison. He said, “Tell these things to James, and to the
brothers.” Then he departed, and went to another place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,18);</script>Now as soon as it was
day, there was no small stir among the soldiers about what had become of
Peter. <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,19);</script>When Herod had
sought for him, and didn’t find him, he examined the guards, and
commanded that they should be put to death. He went down from Judea to
Caesarea, and stayed there. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,20);</script>Now Herod was very angry with
the people of Tyre and Sidon. They came with one accord to him, and,
having made Blastus, the king’s personal aide, their friend, they asked
for peace, because their country depended on the king’s country for
food. <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,21);</script>On an appointed
day, Herod dressed himself in royal clothing, sat on the throne, and gave
a speech to them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,22);</script>The
people shouted, “The voice of a god, and not of a man!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,23);</script>Immediately an angel of the Lord
struck him, because he didn’t give God the glory, and he was eaten by
worms and died.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,24);</script>But the word of God
grew and multiplied. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,25);</script>Barnabas and Saul returned <a
href="#N47">to</a> Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their service, also
taking with them John whose surname was Mark.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,1);</script>Now in the assembly
that was at Antioch there were some prophets and teachers: Barnabas,
Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen the foster brother
of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,2);</script>As they served the Lord and
fasted, the Holy Spirit said, “Separate Barnabas and Saul for me, for
the work to which I have called them.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,3);</script>Then, when they had
fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,4);</script>So, being sent out by the
Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia. From there they sailed to Cyprus.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,5);</script>When they were at
Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues. They
had also John as their attendant. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,6);</script>When they had gone through the
island to Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew,
whose name was Bar Jesus, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,7);</script>who was with the proconsul,
Sergius Paulus, a man of understanding. This man summoned Barnabas and
Saul, and sought to hear the word of God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,8);</script>But Elymas the sorcerer (for so
is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn aside the
proconsul from the faith. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,9);</script>But Saul, who is also called
Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, fastened his eyes on him, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,10);</script>and said, “Full of all deceit
and all cunning, you son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness,
will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,11);</script>Now, behold, the hand of the
Lord is on you, and you will be blind, not seeing the sun for a season!”
<p>Immediately a mist and darkness fell on him. He went around seeking
someone to lead him by the hand. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,12);</script>Then the proconsul, when he saw
what was done, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,13);</script>Now Paul and his
company set sail from Paphos, and came to Perga in Pamphylia. John
departed from them and returned to Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,14);</script>But they, passing on from Perga,
came to Antioch of Pisidia. They went into the synagogue on the Sabbath
day, and sat down. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,15);</script>After
the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent
to them, saying, “Brothers, if you have any word of exhortation for the
people, speak.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,16);</script>Paul stood up, and
beckoning with his hand said, “Men of Israel, and you who fear God,
listen. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,17);</script>The God of this
people<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N48">*</a></sup></font>
chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they stayed as aliens in
the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm, he led them out of it.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,18);</script>For a period of about
forty years he put up with them in the wilderness. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,19);</script>When he had destroyed seven
nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land for an inheritance,
for about four hundred fifty years. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,20);</script>After these things he gave them
judges until Samuel the prophet. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,21);</script>Afterward they asked for a king,
and God gave to them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin,
for forty years. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,22);</script>When he
had removed him, he raised up David to be their king, to whom he also
testified, ‘I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after my heart,
who will do all my will.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,23);</script>From this man’s seed, God has
brought <a href="#N49">salvation</a> to Israel according to his promise,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,24);</script>before his coming, when
John had first preached the baptism of repentance <a href="#N50">to
Israel.</a> <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,25);</script>As John was
fulfilling his course, he said, ‘What do you suppose that I am? I am not
he. But behold, one comes after me the sandals of whose feet I am not
worthy to untie.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,26);</script>Brothers, children of the stock
of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, the word of this salvation
is sent out to you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,27);</script>For
those who dwell in Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they didn’t know
him, nor the voices of the prophets which are read every Sabbath,
fulfilled them by condemning him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,28);</script>Though they found no cause for
death, they still asked Pilate to have him killed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,29);</script>When they had fulfilled all
things that were written about him, they took him down from the tree, and
laid him in a tomb. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,30);</script>But
God raised him from the dead, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,31);</script>and he was seen for many days by
those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his
witnesses to the people. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,32);</script>We bring you good news of the
promise made to the fathers, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,33);</script>that God has fulfilled the same
to us, their children, in that he raised up Jesus. As it is also written
in the second psalm,
<dl>
<dt>‘You are my Son.
<dd>Today I have become your father.’<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N51">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,34);</script>“Concerning that he
raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he has
spoken thus: ‘I will give you the holy and sure blessings of
David.’<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N52">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,35);</script>Therefore he says also in
another psalm, ‘You will not allow your Holy One to see decay.’<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N53">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,36);</script>For David, after he had in his
own generation served the counsel of God, fell asleep, and was laid with
his fathers, and saw decay. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,37);</script>But he whom God raised up saw no
decay. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,38);</script>Be it known to
you therefore, <a href="#N54">brothers</a>, that through this man is
proclaimed to you remission of sins, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,39);</script>and by him everyone who believes
is justified from all things, from which you could not be justified by the
law of Moses. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,40);</script>Beware
therefore, lest that come on you which is spoken in the prophets:
<dl>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,41);</script>‘Behold, you
scoffers, and wonder, and perish;
<dd>for I work a work in your days,
<dd>a work which you will in no way believe, if one declares it to
you.’”<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N55">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,42);</script>So when the Jews went
out of the synagogue, the Gentiles begged that these words might be
preached to them the next Sabbath. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,43);</script>Now when the synagogue broke up,
many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas;
who, speaking to them, urged them to continue in the grace of God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,44);</script>The next Sabbath almost the
whole city was gathered together to hear the word of God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,45);</script>But when the Jews saw the
multitudes, they were filled with jealousy, and contradicted the things
which were spoken by Paul, and blasphemed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,46);</script>Paul and Barnabas
spoke out boldly, and said, “It was necessary that God’s word should
be spoken to you first. Since indeed you thrust it from you, and judge
yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,47);</script>For so has the Lord
commanded us, saying,
<dl>
<dt>‘I have set you as a light for the Gentiles,
<dd>that you should bring salvation to the uttermost parts of the
earth.’”<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N56">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,48);</script>As the Gentiles heard
this, they were glad, and glorified the word of God. As many as were
appointed to eternal life believed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,49);</script>The Lord’s word was spread
abroad throughout all the region. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,50);</script>But the Jews stirred up the
devout and prominent women and the chief men of the city, and stirred up a
persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and threw them out of their
borders. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,51);</script>But they shook
off the dust of their feet against them, and came to Iconium. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,52);</script>The disciples were filled with
joy with the Holy Spirit.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,1);</script>It happened in Iconium
that they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke
that a great multitude both of Jews and of Greeks believed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,2);</script>But the <a
href="#N57">disbelieving</a> Jews stirred up and embittered the souls of
the Gentiles against the brothers. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,3);</script>Therefore they stayed there a
long time, speaking boldly in the Lord, who testified to the word of his
grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,4);</script>But the multitude of the city was
divided. Part sided with the Jews, and part with the apostles. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,5);</script>When some of both the Gentiles
and the Jews, with their rulers, made a violent attempt to mistreat and
stone them, <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,6);</script>they became
aware of it, and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra, Derbe, and the
surrounding region. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,7);</script>There
they preached the Good News.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,8);</script>At Lystra a certain
man sat, impotent in his feet, a cripple from his mother’s womb, who
never had walked. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,9);</script>He was
listening to Paul speaking, who, fastening eyes on him, and seeing that he
had faith to be made whole, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,10);</script>said with a loud voice, “Stand
upright on your feet!” He leaped up and walked. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,11);</script>When the multitude saw what Paul
had done, they lifted up their voice, saying in the language of Lycaonia,
“The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,12);</script>They called Barnabas
“Jupiter,” and Paul “Mercury,” because he was the chief speaker.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(14,13);</script>The priest of Jupiter,
whose temple was in front of their city, brought oxen and garlands to the
gates, and would have made a sacrifice along with the multitudes. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,14);</script>But when the apostles, Barnabas
and Paul, heard of it, they tore their clothes, and sprang into the
multitude, crying out, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,15);</script>“Men, why are you doing these
things? We also are men of like passions with you, and bring you good
news, that you should turn from these vain things to the living God, who
made the sky and the earth and the sea, and all that is in them; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,16);</script>who in the generations gone by
allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,17);</script>Yet he didn’t leave himself
without witness, in that he did good and gave <a href="#N58">you</a> rains
from the sky and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and
gladness.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,18);</script>Even saying these
things, they hardly stopped the multitudes from making a sacrifice to
them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,19);</script>But some Jews from
Antioch and Iconium came there, and having persuaded the multitudes, they
stoned Paul, and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,20);</script>But as the disciples
stood around him, he rose up, and entered into the city. On the next day
he went out with Barnabas to Derbe. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,21);</script>When they had preached the Good
News to that city, and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra,
Iconium, and Antioch, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,22);</script>confirming the souls of the
disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that through many
afflictions we must enter into the Kingdom of God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,23);</script>When they had appointed elders
for them in every assembly, and had prayed with fasting, they commended
them to the Lord, on whom they had believed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,24);</script>They passed through
Pisidia, and came to Pamphylia. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,25);</script>When they had spoken the word in
Perga, they went down to Attalia. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,26);</script>From there they sailed to
Antioch, from where they had been committed to the grace of God for the
work which they had fulfilled. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,27);</script>When they had arrived, and had
gathered the assembly together, they reported all the things that God had
done with them, and that he had opened a door of faith to the nations.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(14,28);</script>They stayed there with
the disciples for a long time.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,1);</script>Some men came down
from Judea and taught the brothers, “Unless you are circumcised after
the custom of Moses, you can’t be saved.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,2);</script>Therefore when Paul and Barnabas
had no small discord and discussion with them, they appointed Paul and
Barnabas, and some others of them, to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles
and elders about this question. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,3);</script>They, being sent on their way by
the assembly, passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, declaring the
conversion of the Gentiles. They caused great joy to all the <a
href="#N59">brothers.</a> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,4);</script>When they had come to Jerusalem,
they were received by the assembly and the apostles and the elders, and
they reported all things that God had done with them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,5);</script>But some of the sect
of the Pharisees who believed rose up, saying, “It is necessary to
circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,6);</script>The apostles and the
elders were gathered together to see about this matter. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,7);</script>When there had been much
discussion, Peter rose up and said to them, “Brothers, you know that a
good while ago God made a choice among you, that by my mouth the nations
should hear the word of the Good News, and believe. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,8);</script>God, who knows the heart,
testified about them, giving them the Holy Spirit, just like he did to us.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(15,9);</script>He made no distinction
between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,10);</script>Now therefore why do you tempt
God, that you should put a yoke on the neck of the disciples which neither
our fathers nor we were able to bear? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,11);</script>But we believe that we are saved
through the grace of the Lord Jesus,<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N60">*</a></sup></font> just as they are.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,12);</script>All the multitude
kept silence, and they listened to Barnabas and Paul reporting what signs
and wonders God had done among the nations through them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,13);</script>After they were silent, James
answered, “Brothers, listen to me. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,14);</script>Simeon has reported how God
first visited the nations, to take out of them a people for his name.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(15,15);</script>This agrees with the
words of the prophets. As it is written,
<dl>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,16);</script>‘After these
things I will return.
<dd>I will again build the tabernacle of David, which has fallen.
<dd>I will again build its ruins.
<dt>I will set it up,
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,17);</script>That the rest of men
may seek after the Lord;
<dd>All the Gentiles who are called by my name,
<dt>Says the Lord, who does all these things.<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N61">*</a></sup></font>
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,18);</script>All his works are
known to God from eternity.’
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,19);</script>“Therefore my
judgment is that we don’t trouble those from among the Gentiles who turn
to God, <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,20);</script>but that we
write to them that they abstain from the pollution of idols, from sexual
immorality, from what is strangled, and from blood. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,21);</script>For Moses from generations of
old has in every city those who preach him, being read in the synagogues
every Sabbath.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,22);</script>Then it seemed good
to the apostles and the elders, with the whole assembly, to choose men out
of their company, and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas: Judas
called Barsabbas, and Silas, chief men among the <a
href="#N62">brothers.</a> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,23);</script>They wrote these things by their
hand:
<p>“The apostles, the elders, and the brothers, to the brothers who are
of the Gentiles in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia: greetings. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,24);</script>Because we have heard that some
who went out from us have troubled you with words, unsettling your souls,
saying, ‘You must be circumcised and keep the law,’ to whom we gave no
commandment; <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,25);</script>it seemed
good to us, having come to one accord, to choose out men and send them to
you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,26);</script>men who have risked their lives
for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,27);</script>We have sent therefore Judas and
Silas, who themselves will also tell you the same things by word of mouth.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(15,28);</script>For it seemed good to
the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay no greater burden on you than these
necessary things: <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,29);</script>that
you abstain from things sacrificed to idols, from blood, from things
strangled, and from sexual immorality, from which if you keep yourselves,
it will be well with you. Farewell.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,30);</script>So, when they were
sent off, they came to Antioch. Having gathered the multitude together,
they delivered the letter. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,31);</script>When they had read it, they
rejoiced over the encouragement. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,32);</script>Judas and Silas, also being
prophets themselves, encouraged the brothers with many words, and
strengthened them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,33);</script>After
they had spent some time there, they were sent back with greetings from
the brothers to the apostles. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,34);</script><font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N63">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,35);</script>But Paul and Barnabas stayed in
Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others
also.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,36);</script>After some days Paul
said to Barnabas, “Let’s return now and visit our brothers in every
city in which we proclaimed the word of the Lord, to see how they are
doing.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,37);</script>Barnabas
planned to take John, who was called Mark, with them also. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,38);</script>But Paul didn’t think that it
was a good idea to take with them someone who had withdrawn from them in
Pamphylia, and didn’t go with them to do the work. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,39);</script>Then the contention grew so
sharp that they separated from each other. Barnabas took Mark with him,
and sailed away to Cyprus, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,40);</script>but Paul chose Silas, and went
out, being commended by the brothers to the grace of God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,41);</script>He went through Syria and
Cilicia, strengthening the assemblies.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,1);</script>He came to Derbe and
Lystra: and behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son
of a Jewess who believed; but his father was a Greek. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,2);</script>The brothers who were at Lystra
and Iconium gave a good testimony about him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,3);</script>Paul wanted to have him go out
with him, and he took and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in
those parts; for they all knew that his father was a Greek. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,4);</script>As they went on their way through
the cities, they delivered the decrees to them to keep which had been
ordained by the apostles and elders who were at Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,5);</script>So the assemblies were
strengthened in the faith, and increased in number daily.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,6);</script>When they had gone
through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, they were forbidden by the Holy
Spirit to speak the word in Asia. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,7);</script>When they had come opposite
Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit didn’t allow them.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(16,8);</script>Passing by Mysia, they
came down to Troas. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,9);</script>A
vision appeared to Paul in the night. There was a man of Macedonia
standing, begging him, and saying, “Come over into Macedonia and help
us.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,10);</script>When he had seen
the vision, immediately we sought to go out to Macedonia, concluding that
the Lord had called us to preach the Good News to them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,11);</script>Setting sail therefore from
Troas, we made a straight course to Samothrace, and the day following to
Neapolis; <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,12);</script>and from there
to Philippi, which is a city of Macedonia, the foremost of the district, a
Roman colony. We were staying some days in this city.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,13);</script>On the Sabbath day we
went forth outside of the city by a riverside, where we supposed there was
a place of prayer, and we sat down, and spoke to the women who had come
together. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,14);</script>A certain
woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, one who
worshiped God, heard us; whose heart the Lord opened to listen to the
things which were spoken by Paul. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,15);</script>When she and her household were
baptized, she begged us, saying, “If you have judged me to be faithful
to the Lord, come into my house, and stay.” So she persuaded us.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,16);</script>It happened, as we
were going to prayer, that a certain girl having a spirit of divination
met us, who brought her masters much gain by fortune telling. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,17);</script>Following Paul and us, she cried
out, “These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to us a
way of salvation!” <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,18);</script>She
was doing this for many days.
<p>But Paul, becoming greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, “I
command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!” It came out
that very hour. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,19);</script>But when
her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, they seized Paul and
Silas, and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,20);</script>When they had brought them to
the magistrates, they said, “These men, being Jews, are agitating our
city, <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,21);</script>and set forth
customs which it is not lawful for us to accept or to observe, being
Romans.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,22);</script>The multitude rose up
together against them, and the magistrates tore their clothes off of them,
and commanded them to be beaten with rods. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,23);</script>When they had laid many stripes
on them, they threw them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them
safely, <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,24);</script>who, having
received such a command, threw them into the inner prison, and secured
their feet in the stocks.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,25);</script>But about midnight
Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners
were listening to them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,26);</script>Suddenly there was a great
earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and
immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone’s bonds were
loosened. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,27);</script>The jailer,
being roused out of sleep and seeing the prison doors open, drew his sword
and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(16,28);</script>But Paul cried with a
loud voice, saying, “Don’t harm yourself, for we are all here!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,29);</script>He called for lights
and sprang in, and, fell down trembling before Paul and Silas, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,30);</script>and brought them out and said,
“Sirs, what must I do to be saved?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,31);</script>They said, “Believe
in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your
household.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,32);</script>They spoke
the word of the Lord to him, and to all who were in his house.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,33);</script>He took them the same
hour of the night, and washed their stripes, and was immediately baptized,
he and all his household. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,34);</script>He brought them up into his
house, and set food before them, and rejoiced greatly, with all his
household, having believed in God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,35);</script>But when it was day,
the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, “Let those men go.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,36);</script>The jailer reported
these words to Paul, saying, “The magistrates have sent to let you go;
now therefore come out, and go in peace.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,37);</script>But Paul said to
them, “They have beaten us publicly, without a trial, men who are
Romans, and have cast us into prison! Do they now release us secretly? No,
most certainly, but let them come themselves and bring us out!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,38);</script>The sergeants
reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they
heard that they were Romans, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,39);</script>and they came and begged them.
When they had brought them out, they asked them to depart from the city.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(16,40);</script>They went out of the
prison, and entered into Lydia’s house. When they had seen the brothers,
they encouraged them, and departed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,1);</script>Now when they had
passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where
there was a Jewish synagogue. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,2);</script>Paul, as was his custom, went in
to them, and for three Sabbath days reasoned with them from the
Scriptures, <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,3);</script>explaining
and demonstrating that the Christ had to suffer and rise again from the
dead, and saying, “This Jesus, whom I proclaim to you, is the Christ.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,4);</script>Some of them were
persuaded, and joined Paul and Silas, of the devout Greeks a great
multitude, and not a few of the chief women. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,5);</script><a href="#N64">But the
unpersuaded Jews took along</a> some wicked men from the marketplace, and
gathering a crowd, set the city in an uproar. Assaulting the house of
Jason, they sought to bring them out to the people. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,6);</script>When they didn’t find them,
they dragged Jason and certain <a href="#N65">brothers</a> before the
rulers of the city, crying, “These who have turned the world upside down
have come here also, <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,7);</script>whom
Jason has received. These all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar,
saying that there is another king, Jesus!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,8);</script>The multitude and the rulers of
the city were troubled when they heard these things. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,9);</script>When they had taken security from
Jason and the rest, they let them go. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,10);</script>The brothers immediately sent
Paul and Silas away by night to Beroea. When they arrived, they went into
the Jewish synagogue.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,11);</script>Now these were more
noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all
readiness of the mind, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these
things were so. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,12);</script>Many of
them therefore believed; also of the prominent Greek women, and not a few
men. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,13);</script>But when the Jews
of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul
at Beroea also, they came there likewise, agitating the multitudes.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(17,14);</script>Then the brothers
immediately sent out Paul to go as far as to the sea, and Silas and
Timothy still stayed there. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,15);</script>But those who escorted Paul
brought him as far as Athens. Receiving a commandment to Silas and Timothy
that they should come to him very quickly, they departed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,16);</script>Now while Paul waited
for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he saw the city
full of idols. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,17);</script>So he
reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons, and in the
marketplace every day with those who met him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,18);</script>Some of the Epicurean and Stoic
philosophers <a href="#N66">also</a> were conversing with him. Some said,
“What does this babbler want to say?”
<p>Others said, “He seems to be advocating foreign deities,” because
he preached Jesus and the resurrection.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,19);</script>They took hold of
him, and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, “May we know what this
new teaching is, which is spoken by you? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,20);</script>For you bring certain strange
things to our ears. We want to know therefore what these things mean.”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(17,21);</script>Now all the Athenians
and the strangers living there spent their time in nothing else, but
either to tell or to hear some new thing.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,22);</script>Paul stood in the
middle of the Areopagus, and said, “You men of Athens, I perceive that
you are very religious in all things. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,23);</script>For as I passed along, and
observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this
inscription: ‘TO AN UNKNOWN GOD.’ What therefore you worship in
ignorance, this I announce to you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,24);</script>The God who made the world and
all things in it, he, being Lord of heaven and earth, doesn’t dwell in
temples made with hands, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,25);</script>neither is he served by men’s
hands, as though he needed anything, seeing he himself gives to all life
and breath, and all things. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,26);</script>He made from one blood every
nation of men to dwell on all the surface of the earth, having determined
appointed seasons, and the boundaries of their dwellings, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,27);</script>that they should seek the Lord,
if perhaps they might reach out for him and find him, though he is not far
from each one of us. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,28);</script>‘For in him we live, and move,
and have our being.’ As some of your own poets have said, ‘For we are
also his offspring.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,29);</script>Being then the offspring of God,
we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold, or silver, or
stone, engraved by art and design of man. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,30);</script>The times of ignorance therefore
God overlooked. But now he commands that all people everywhere should
repent, <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,31);</script>because he has
appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the
man whom he has ordained; of which he has given assurance to all men, in
that he has raised him from the dead.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,32);</script>Now when they heard
of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked; but others said, “We want
to hear you again concerning this.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,33);</script>Thus Paul went out
from among them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,34);</script>But
certain men joined with him, and believed, among whom also was Dionysius
the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,1);</script>After these things
Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,2);</script>He found a certain Jew named
Aquila, a man of Pontus by race, who had recently come from Italy, with
his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart
from Rome. He came to them, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,3);</script>and because he practiced the same
trade, he lived with them and worked, for by trade they were tent makers.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,4);</script>He reasoned in the
synagogue every Sabbath, and persuaded Jews and Greeks. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,5);</script>But when Silas and Timothy came
down from Macedonia, Paul was compelled by the Spirit, testifying to the
Jews that Jesus was the Christ. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,6);</script>When they opposed him and
blasphemed, he shook out his clothing and said to them, “Your blood be
on your own heads! I am clean. From now on, I will go to the Gentiles!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,7);</script>He departed there, and
went into the house of a certain man named Justus, one who worshiped God,
whose house was next door to the synagogue. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,8);</script>Crispus, the ruler of the
synagogue, believed in the Lord with all his house. Many of the
Corinthians, when they heard, believed and were baptized. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,9);</script>The Lord said to Paul in the
night by a vision, <span class="j">“Don’t be afraid, but speak and
don’t be silent; <script type="text/javascript">cj(18,10);</script>for I
am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you, for I have many
people in this city.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,11);</script>He lived there a year
and six months, teaching the word of God among them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,12);</script>But when Gallio was proconsul of
Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him
before the judgment seat, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,13);</script>saying, “This man persuades
men to worship God contrary to the law.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,14);</script>But when Paul was
about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, “If indeed it were a
matter of wrong or of wicked crime, you Jews, it would be reasonable that
I should bear with you; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,15);</script>but if they are questions about
words and names and your own law, look to it yourselves. For I don’t
want to be a judge of these matters.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,16);</script>He drove them from the judgment
seat.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,17);</script>Then all the Greeks
laid hold on Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before
the judgment seat. Gallio didn’t care about any of these things.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,18);</script>Paul, having stayed
after this many more days, took his leave of the <a
href="#N67">brothers,</a> and sailed from there for Syria, together with
Priscilla and Aquila. He shaved his head in Cenchreae, for he had a vow.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,19);</script>He came to Ephesus, and
he left them there; but he himself entered into the synagogue, and
reasoned with the Jews. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,20);</script>When they asked him to stay with
them a longer time, he declined; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,21);</script>but taking his leave of them,
and saying, “I must by all means keep this coming feast in Jerusalem,
but I will return again to you if God wills,” he set sail from Ephesus.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,22);</script>When he had landed at
Caesarea, he went up and greeted the assembly, and went down to Antioch.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,23);</script>Having spent some time
there, he departed, and went through the region of Galatia, and Phrygia,
in order, establishing all the disciples. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,24);</script>Now a certain Jew named Apollos,
an Alexandrian by race, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus. He was mighty in
the Scriptures. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,25);</script>This man
had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit,
he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, although he
knew only the baptism of John. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,26);</script>He began to speak boldly in the
synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside,
and explained to him the way of God more accurately.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,27);</script>When he had
determined to pass over into Achaia, the brothers encouraged him, and
wrote to the disciples to receive him. When he had come, he greatly helped
those who had believed through grace; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,28);</script>for he powerfully refuted the
Jews, publicly showing by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,1);</script>It happened that,
while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul, having passed through the upper
country, came to Ephesus, and found certain disciples. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,2);</script>He said to them, “Did you
receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?”
<p>They said to him, “No, we haven’t even heard that there is a Holy
Spirit.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,3);</script>He said, “Into what
then were you baptized?”
<p>They said, “Into John’s baptism.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,4);</script>Paul said, “John
indeed baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying to the people that
they should believe in the one who would come after him, that is, in
Jesus.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,5);</script>When they heard this,
they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,6);</script>When Paul had laid his hands on
them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke with other languages
and prophesied. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,7);</script>They were
about twelve men in all. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,8);</script>He entered into the synagogue,
and spoke boldly for a period of three months, reasoning and persuading
about the things concerning the Kingdom of God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,9);</script>But when some were
hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude,
he departed from them, and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the
school of Tyrannus. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,10);</script>This
continued for two years, so that all those who lived in Asia heard the
word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,11);</script>God worked special
miracles by the hands of Paul, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,12);</script>so that even handkerchiefs or
aprons were carried away from his body to the sick, and the evil spirits
went out. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,13);</script>But some of
the itinerant Jews, exorcists, took on themselves to invoke over those who
had the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, “We adjure you
by Jesus whom Paul preaches.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,14);</script>There were seven sons of one
Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, who did this.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,15);</script>The evil spirit
answered, “Jesus I know, and Paul I know, but who are you?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,16);</script>The man in whom the evil spirit
was leaped on them, and overpowered them, and prevailed against them, so
that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,17);</script>This became known to all, both
Jews and Greeks, who lived at Ephesus. Fear fell on them all, and the name
of the Lord Jesus was magnified. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,18);</script>Many also of those who had
believed came, confessing, and declaring their deeds. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,19);</script>Many of those who practiced
magical arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of
all. They counted their price, and found it to be <a href="#N68">fifty
thousand pieces of silver.</a> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,20);</script>So the word of the Lord was
growing and becoming mighty.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,21);</script>Now after these
things had ended, Paul determined in the spirit, when he had passed
through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, “After I have
been there, I must also see Rome.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,22);</script>Having sent into
Macedonia two of those who served him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself
stayed in Asia for a while. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,23);</script>About that time there arose no
small stir concerning the Way. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,24);</script>For a certain man named
Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought no
little business to the craftsmen, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,25);</script>whom he gathered together, with
the workmen of like occupation, and said, “Sirs, you know that by this
business we have our wealth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,26);</script>You see and hear, that not at
Ephesus alone, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and
turned away many people, saying that they are no gods, that are made with
hands. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,27);</script>Not only is there
danger that this our trade come into disrepute, but also that the temple
of the great goddess Artemis will be counted as nothing, and her majesty
destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worships.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,28);</script>When they heard this
they were filled with anger, and cried out, saying, “Great is Artemis of
the Ephesians!” <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,29);</script>The
whole city was filled with confusion, and they rushed with one accord into
the theater, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia,
Paul’s companions in travel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,30);</script>When Paul wanted to enter in to
the people, the disciples didn’t allow him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,31);</script>Certain also of the Asiarchs,
being his friends, sent to him and begged him not to venture into the
theater. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,32);</script>Some therefore
cried one thing, and some another, for the assembly was in confusion. Most
of them didn’t know why they had come together. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,33);</script>They brought Alexander out of
the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. Alexander beckoned with his
hand, and would have made a defense to the people. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,34);</script>But when they perceived that he
was a Jew, all with one voice for a time of about two hours cried out,
“Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,35);</script>When the town clerk
had quieted the multitude, he said, “You men of Ephesus, what man is
there who doesn’t know that the city of the Ephesians is temple keeper
of the great goddess Artemis, and of the image which fell down from Zeus?
<script type="text/javascript">cb(19,36);</script>Seeing then that these
things can’t be denied, you ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rash.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(19,37);</script>For you have brought
these men here, who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of your
goddess. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,38);</script>If therefore
Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a matter against anyone,
the courts are open, and there are proconsuls. Let them press charges
against one another. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,39);</script>But
if you seek anything about other matters, it will be settled in the
regular assembly. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,40);</script>For
indeed we are in danger of being accused concerning this day’s riot,
there being no cause. Concerning it, we wouldn’t be able to give an
account of this commotion.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,41);</script>When he had thus spoken, he
dismissed the assembly.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,1);</script>After the uproar had
ceased, Paul sent for the disciples, took leave of them, and departed to
go into Macedonia. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,2);</script>When
he had gone through those parts, and had encouraged them with many words,
he came into Greece. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,3);</script>When
he had spent three months there, and a plot was made against him by Jews
as he was about to set sail for Syria, he determined to return through
Macedonia. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,4);</script>These
accompanied him as far as Asia: Sopater of Beroea; Aristarchus and
Secundus of the Thessalonians; Gaius of Derbe; Timothy; and Tychicus and
Trophimus of Asia. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,5);</script>But
these had gone ahead, and were waiting for us at Troas. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,6);</script>We sailed away from Philippi
after the days of Unleavened Bread, and came to them at Troas in five
days, where we stayed seven days.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,7);</script>On the first day of
the week, when the disciples were gathered together to break bread, Paul
talked with them, intending to depart on the next day, and continued his
speech until midnight. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,8);</script>There were many lights in the
upper room where <a href="#N69">we</a> were gathered together. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,9);</script>A certain young man named
Eutychus sat in the window, weighed down with deep sleep. As Paul spoke
still longer, being weighed down by his sleep, he fell down from the third
story, and was taken up dead. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,10);</script>Paul went down, and fell upon
him, and embracing him said, “Don’t be troubled, for his life is in
him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,11);</script>When he had gone up,
and had broken bread, and eaten, and had talked with them a long while,
even until break of day, he departed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,12);</script>They brought the boy in alive,
and were greatly comforted.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,13);</script>But we who went ahead
to the ship set sail for Assos, intending to take Paul aboard there, for
he had so arranged, intending himself to go by land. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,14);</script>When he met us at Assos, we took
him aboard, and came to Mitylene. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,15);</script>Sailing from there, we came the
following day opposite Chios. The next day we touched at Samos and stayed
at Trogyllium, and the day after we came to Miletus. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,16);</script>For Paul had determined to sail
past Ephesus, that he might not have to spend time in Asia; for he was
hastening, if it were possible for him, to be in Jerusalem on the day of
Pentecost.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,17);</script>From Miletus he sent
to Ephesus, and called to himself the elders of the assembly. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,18);</script>When they had come to him, he
said to them, “You yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot
in Asia, how I was with you all the time, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,19);</script>serving the Lord with all
humility, with many tears, and with trials which happened to me by the
plots of the Jews; <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,20);</script>how I
didn’t shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable,
teaching you publicly and from house to house, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,21);</script>testifying both to Jews and to
Greeks repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus.<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N70">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,22);</script>Now, behold, I go bound by the
Spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,23);</script>except that the Holy Spirit
testifies in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions wait for me.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(20,24);</script>But these things don’t
count; nor do I hold my life dear to myself, so that I may finish my race
with joy, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to fully
testify to the Good News of the grace of God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,25);</script>“Now, behold, I
know that you all, among whom I went about preaching the Kingdom of God,
will see my face no more. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,26);</script>Therefore I testify to you this
day that I am clean from the blood of all men, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,27);</script>for I didn’t shrink from
declaring to you the whole counsel of God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,28);</script>Take heed, therefore, to
yourselves, and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you
overseers, to shepherd the assembly of <a href="#N71">the Lord and</a> God
which he purchased with his own blood. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,29);</script>For I know that after my
departure, vicious wolves will enter in among you, not sparing the flock.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(20,30);</script>Men will arise from
among your own selves, speaking perverse things, to draw away the
disciples after them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,31);</script>Therefore watch, remembering
that for a period of three years I didn’t cease to admonish everyone
night and day with tears. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,32);</script>Now, <a
href="#N72">brothers,</a> I entrust you to God, and to the word of his
grace, which is able to build up, and to give you the inheritance among
all those who are sanctified. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,33);</script>I coveted no one’s silver, or
gold, or clothing. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,34);</script>You
yourselves know that these hands served my necessities, and those who were
with me. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,35);</script>In all things I
gave you an example, that so laboring you ought to help the weak, and to
remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, <span
class="j">‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’</span>”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,36);</script>When he had spoken
these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,37);</script>They all wept a lot, and fell on
Paul’s neck and kissed him, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,38);</script>sorrowing most of all because of
the word which he had spoken, that they should see his face no more. And
they accompanied him to the ship.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,1);</script>When it happened that
we had parted from them and had set sail, we came with a straight course
to Cos, and the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,2);</script>Having found a ship crossing over
to Phoenicia, we went aboard, and set sail. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,3);</script>When we had come in sight of
Cyprus, leaving it on the left hand, we sailed to Syria, and landed at
Tyre, for there the ship was to unload her cargo. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,4);</script>Having found disciples, we stayed
there seven days. These said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should
not go up to Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,5);</script>When it happened that we had
accomplished the days, we departed and went on our journey. They all, with
wives and children, brought us on our way until we were out of the city.
Kneeling down on the beach, we prayed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,6);</script>After saying goodbye to each
other, we went on board the ship, and they returned home again.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,7);</script>When we had finished
the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais. We greeted the brothers,
and stayed with them one day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,8);</script>On the next day, we, who were
Paul’s companions, departed, and came to Caesarea.
<p>We entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the
seven, and stayed with him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,9);</script>Now this man had four virgin
daughters who prophesied. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,10);</script>As we stayed there some days, a
certain prophet named Agabus came down from Judea. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,11);</script>Coming to us, and taking
Paul’s belt, he bound his own feet and hands, and said, “Thus says the
Holy Spirit: ‘So will the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man who owns this
belt, and will deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,12);</script>When we heard these
things, both we and they of that place begged him not to go up to
Jerusalem. <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,13);</script>Then Paul
answered, “What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am
ready not only to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of
the Lord Jesus.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,14);</script>When he would not be
persuaded, we ceased, saying, “The Lord’s will be done.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,15);</script>After these days we
took up our baggage and went up to Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,16);</script>Some of the disciples from
Caesarea also went with us, bringing one Mnason of Cyprus, an early
disciple, with whom we would stay.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,17);</script>When we had come to
Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,18);</script>The day following, Paul went in
with us to James; and all the elders were present. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,19);</script>When he had greeted them, he
reported one by one the things which God had worked among the Gentiles
through his ministry. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,20);</script>They, when they heard it,
glorified God. They said to him, “You see, brother, how many thousands
there are among the Jews of those who have believed, and they are all
zealous for the law. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,21);</script>They have been informed about
you, that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake
Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children neither to walk after
the customs. <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,22);</script>What then?
The assembly must certainly meet, for they will hear that you have come.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(21,23);</script>Therefore do what we
tell you. We have four men who have taken a vow. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,24);</script>Take them, and purify yourself
with them, and pay their expenses for them, that they may shave their
heads. Then all will know that there is no truth in the things that they
have been informed about you, but that you yourself also walk keeping the
law. <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,25);</script>But concerning the
Gentiles who believe, we have written our decision that they should
observe no such thing, except that they should keep themselves from food
offered to idols, from blood, from strangled things, and from sexual
immorality.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,26);</script>Then Paul took the
men, and the next day, purified himself and went with them into the
temple, declaring the fulfillment of the days of purification, until the
offering was offered for every one of them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,27);</script>When the seven days were almost
completed, the Jews from Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up
all the multitude and laid hands on him, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,28);</script>crying out, “Men of Israel,
help! This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against the people,
and the law, and this place. Moreover, he also brought Greeks into the
temple, and has defiled this holy place!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,29);</script>For they had seen Trophimus, the
Ephesian, with him in the city, and they supposed that Paul had brought
him into the temple.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,30);</script>All the city was
moved, and the people ran together. They seized Paul and dragged him out
of the temple. Immediately the doors were shut. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,31);</script>As they were trying to kill him,
news came up to the commanding officer of the regiment that all Jerusalem
was in an uproar. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,32);</script>Immediately he took soldiers and
centurions, and ran down to them. They, when they saw the chief captain
and the soldiers, stopped beating Paul. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,33);</script>Then the commanding officer came
near, arrested him, commanded him to be bound with two chains, and
inquired who he was and what he had done. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,34);</script>Some shouted one thing, and some
another, among the crowd. When he couldn’t find out the truth because of
the noise, he commanded him to be brought into the barracks.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,35);</script>When he came to the
stairs, it happened that he was carried by the soldiers because of the
violence of the crowd; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,36);</script>for the multitude of the people
followed after, crying out, “Away with him!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,37);</script>As Paul was about to be brought
into the barracks, he asked the commanding officer, “May I speak to
you?”
<p>He said, “Do you know Greek? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,38);</script>Aren’t you then the Egyptian,
who before these days stirred up to sedition and led out into the
wilderness the four thousand men of the Assassins?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,39);</script>But Paul said, “I
am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city. I
beg you, allow me to speak to the people.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,40);</script>When he had given him
permission, Paul, standing on the stairs, beckoned with his hand to the
people. When there was a great silence, he spoke to them in the Hebrew
language, saying,
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,1);</script>“Brothers and
fathers, listen to the defense which I now make to you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,2);</script>When they heard that
he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, they were even more quiet. He
said, <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,3);</script>“I am indeed a
Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city at the feet of
Gamaliel, instructed according to the strict tradition of the law of our
fathers, being zealous for God, even as you all are this day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,4);</script>I persecuted this Way to the
death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,5);</script>As also the high priest and all
the council of the elders testify, from whom also I received letters to
the brothers, and traveled to Damascus to bring them also who were there
to Jerusalem in bonds to be punished. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,6);</script>It happened that, as I made my
journey, and came close to Damascus, about noon, suddenly there shone from
the sky a great light around me. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,7);</script>I fell to the ground, and heard a
voice saying to me, <span class="j">‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting
me?’</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,8);</script>I answered,
‘Who are you, Lord?’ He said to me, <span class="j">‘I am Jesus of
Nazareth, whom you persecute.’</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,9);</script>“Those who were with
me indeed saw the light and were afraid, but they didn’t understand the
voice of him who spoke to me. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,10);</script>I said, ‘What shall I do,
Lord?’ The Lord said to me, <span class="j">‘Arise, and go into
Damascus. There you will be told about all things which are appointed for
you to do.’</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,11);</script>When I couldn’t see for the
glory of that light, being led by the hand of those who were with me, I
came into Damascus. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,12);</script>One
Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well reported of by all the
Jews who lived in Damascus, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,13);</script>came to me, and standing by me
said to me, ‘Brother Saul, receive your sight!’ In that very hour I
looked up at him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,14);</script>He
said, ‘The God of our fathers has appointed you to know his will, and to
see the Righteous One, and to hear a voice from his mouth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,15);</script>For you will be a witness for
him to all men of what you have seen and heard. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,16);</script>Now why do you wait? Arise, be
baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord.’
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,17);</script>“It happened that,
when I had returned to Jerusalem, and while I prayed in the temple, I fell
into a trance, <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,18);</script>and saw
him saying to me, <span class="j">‘Hurry and get out of Jerusalem
quickly, because they will not receive testimony concerning me from
you.’</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,19);</script>I said,
‘Lord, they themselves know that I imprisoned and beat in every
synagogue those who believed in you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,20);</script>When the blood of Stephen, your
witness, was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting to his death,
and guarding the cloaks of those who killed him.’
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,21);</script>“He said to me,
<span class="j">‘Depart, for I will send you out far from here to the
Gentiles.’</span>”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,22);</script>They listened to him
until he said that; then they lifted up their voice, and said, “Rid the
earth of this fellow, for he isn’t fit to live!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,23);</script>As they cried out,
and threw off their cloaks, and threw dust into the air, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,24);</script>the commanding officer commanded
him to be brought into the barracks, ordering him to be examined by
scourging, that he might know for what crime they shouted against him like
that. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,25);</script>When they had tied
him up with thongs, Paul asked the centurion who stood by, “Is it lawful
for you to scourge a man who is a Roman, and not found guilty?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,26);</script>When the centurion
heard it, he went to the commanding officer and told him, “Watch what
you are about to do, for this man is a Roman!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,27);</script>The commanding
officer came and asked him, “Tell me, are you a Roman?”
<p>He said, “Yes.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,28);</script>The commanding
officer answered, “I bought my citizenship for a great price.”
<p>Paul said, “But I was born a Roman.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,29);</script>Immediately those who
were about to examine him departed from him, and the commanding officer
also was afraid when he realized that he was a Roman, because he had bound
him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,30);</script>But on the next
day, desiring to know the truth about why he was accused by the Jews, he
freed him from the bonds, and commanded the chief priests and all the
council to come together, and brought Paul down and set him before them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,1);</script>Paul, looking
steadfastly at the council, said, “Brothers, I have lived before God in
all good conscience until this day.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,2);</script>The high priest,
Ananias, commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,3);</script>Then Paul said to him,
“God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! Do you sit to judge me
according to the law, and command me to be struck contrary to the law?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,4);</script>Those who stood by
said, “Do you malign God’s high priest?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,5);</script>Paul said, “I
didn’t know, brothers, that he was high priest. For it is written,
‘You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.’”<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N73">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,6);</script>But when Paul perceived that the
one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the
council, “Men and brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees.
Concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I am being judged!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,7);</script>When he had said this,
an argument arose between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the assembly
was divided. <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,8);</script>For the
Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit; but
the Pharisees confess all of these. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,9);</script>A great clamor arose, and some of
the scribes of the Pharisees part stood up, and contended, saying, “We
find no evil in this man. But if a spirit or angel has spoken to him,
let’s not fight against God!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,10);</script>When a great argument
arose, the commanding officer, fearing that Paul would be torn in pieces
by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from
among them, and bring him into the barracks.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,11);</script>The following night,
the Lord stood by him, and said, <span class="j">“Cheer up, Paul, for as
you have testified about me at Jerusalem, so you must testify also at
Rome.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,12);</script>When it was day, some
of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying
that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,13);</script>There were more than forty
people who had made this conspiracy. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,14);</script>They came to the chief priests
and the elders, and said, “We have bound ourselves under a great curse,
to taste nothing until we have killed Paul. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,15);</script>Now therefore, you with the
council inform the commanding officer that he should bring him down to you
tomorrow, as though you were going to judge his case more exactly. We are
ready to kill him before he comes near.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,16);</script>But Paul’s
sister’s son heard of their lying in wait, and he came and entered into
the barracks and told Paul. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,17);</script>Paul summoned one of the
centurions, and said, “Bring this young man to the commanding officer,
for he has something to tell him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,18);</script>So he took him, and
brought him to the commanding officer, and said, “Paul, the prisoner,
summoned me and asked me to bring this young man to you, who has something
to tell you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,19);</script>The commanding
officer took him by the hand, and going aside, asked him privately,
“What is it that you have to tell me?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,20);</script>He said, “The Jews
have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow, as
though intending to inquire somewhat more accurately concerning him.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(23,21);</script>Therefore don’t yield
to them, for more than forty men lie in wait for him, who have bound
themselves under a curse neither to eat nor to drink until they have
killed him. Now they are ready, looking for the promise from you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,22);</script>So the commanding
officer let the young man go, charging him, “Tell no one that you have
revealed these things to me.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,23);</script>He called to himself two of the
centurions, and said, “Prepare two hundred soldiers to go as far as
Caesarea, with seventy horsemen, and two hundred men armed with spears, at
<a href="#N74">the third hour of the night</a>.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,24);</script>He asked them to provide
animals, that they might set Paul on one, and bring him safely to Felix
the governor. <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,25);</script>He wrote a
letter like this:
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,26);</script>“Claudius Lysias to
the most excellent governor Felix: Greetings.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,27);</script>“This man was
seized by the Jews, and was about to be killed by them, when I came with
the soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,28);</script>Desiring to know the cause why
they accused him, I brought him down to their council. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,29);</script>I found him to be accused about
questions of their law, but not to be charged with anything worthy of
death or of imprisonment. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,30);</script>When I was told that the Jews
lay in wait for the man, I sent him to you immediately, charging his
accusers also to bring their accusations against him before you.
Farewell.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,31);</script>So the soldiers,
carrying out their orders, took Paul and brought him by night to
Antipatris. <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,32);</script>But on the
next day they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the
barracks. <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,33);</script>When they came
to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented
Paul to him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,34);</script>When the
governor had read it, he asked what province he was from. When he
understood that he was from Cilicia, he said, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,35);</script>“I will hear you fully when
your accusers also arrive.” He commanded that he be kept in Herod’s
palace.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,1);</script>After five days, the
high priest, Ananias, came down with certain elders and an orator, one
Tertullus. They informed the governor against Paul. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,2);</script>When he was called, Tertullus
began to accuse him, saying, “Seeing that by you we enjoy much peace,
and that excellent measures are coming to this nation, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,3);</script>we accept it in all ways and in
all places, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,4);</script>But, that I don’t delay you, I
entreat you to bear with us and hear a few words. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,5);</script>For we have found this man to be
a plague, an instigator of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the
world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,6);</script>He even tried to profane the
temple, and we arrested him.<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a

type="text/javascript">cb(24,7);</script><font color="#0000ff"

type="text/javascript">cb(24,8);</script><font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N77">*</a></sup></font>By examining him yourself
you may ascertain all these things of which we accuse him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,9);</script>The Jews also joined
in the attack, affirming that these things were so. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,10);</script>When the governor had beckoned
to him to speak, Paul answered, “Because I know that you have been a
judge of this nation for many years, I cheerfully make my defense, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,11);</script>seeing that you can recognize
that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at
Jerusalem. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,12);</script>In the temple
they didn’t find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd, either
in the synagogues, or in the city. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,13);</script>Nor can they prove to you the
things of which they now accuse me. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,14);</script>But this I confess to you, that
after the Way, which they call a sect, so I serve the God of our fathers,
believing all things which are according to the law, and which are written
in the prophets; <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,15);</script>having
hope toward God, which these also themselves look for, that there will be
a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,16);</script>Herein I also practice always
having a conscience void of offense toward God and men. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,17);</script>Now after some years, I came to
bring gifts for the needy to my nation, and offerings; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,18);</script>amid which certain Jews from
Asia found me purified in the temple, not with a mob, nor with turmoil.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(24,19);</script>They ought to have been
here before you, and to make accusation, if they had anything against me.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(24,20);</script>Or else let these men
themselves say what injustice they found in me when I stood before the
council, <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,21);</script>unless it is
for this one thing that I cried standing among them, ‘Concerning the
resurrection of the dead I am being judged before you today!’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,22);</script>But Felix, having
more exact knowledge concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, “When
Lysias, the commanding officer, comes down, I will decide your case.”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(24,23);</script>He ordered the centurion
that Paul should be kept in custody, and should have some privileges, and
not to forbid any of his friends to serve him or to visit him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,24);</script>But after some days, Felix came
with Drusilla, his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, and heard
him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,25);</script>As he reasoned about
righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was
terrified, and answered, “Go your way for this time, and when it is
convenient for me, I will summon you.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,26);</script>Meanwhile, he also hoped that
money would be given to him by Paul, that he might release him. Therefore
also he sent for him more often, and talked with him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,27);</script>But when two years were
fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, and desiring to gain
favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul in bonds.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,1);</script>Festus therefore,
having come into the province, after three days went up to Jerusalem from
Caesarea. <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,2);</script>Then the high
priest and the principal men of the Jews informed him against Paul, and
they begged him, <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,3);</script>asking a
favor against him, that he would summon him to Jerusalem; plotting to kill
him on the way. <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,4);</script>However
Festus answered that Paul should be kept in custody at Caesarea, and that
he himself was about to depart shortly. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,5);</script>“Let them therefore,” said
he, “that are in power among you go down with me, and if there is
anything wrong in the man, let them accuse him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,6);</script>When he had stayed
among them more than ten days, he went down to Caesarea, and on the next
day he sat on the judgment seat, and commanded Paul to be brought. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,7);</script>When he had come, the Jews who
had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing against him many
and grievous charges which they could not prove, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,8);</script>while he said in his defense,
“Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor
against Caesar, have I sinned at all.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,9);</script>But Festus, desiring
to gain favor with the Jews, answered Paul and said, “Are you willing to
go up to Jerusalem, and be judged by me there concerning these things?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,10);</script>But Paul said, “I
am standing before Caesar’s judgment seat, where I ought to be tried. I
have done no wrong to the Jews, as you also know very well. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,11);</script>For if I have done wrong, and
have committed anything worthy of death, I don’t refuse to die; but if
none of those things is true that they accuse me of, no one can give me up
to them. I appeal to Caesar!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,12);</script>Then Festus, when he
had conferred with the council, answered, “You have appealed to Caesar.
To Caesar you shall go.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,13);</script>Now when some days
had passed, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea, and greeted
Festus. <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,14);</script>As he stayed
there many days, Festus laid Paul’s case before the king, saying,
“There is a certain man left a prisoner by Felix; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,15);</script>about whom, when I was at
Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me,
asking for a sentence against him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,16);</script>To whom I answered that it is
not the custom of the Romans to give up any man to destruction, before the
accused has met the accusers face to face, and has had opportunity to make
his defense concerning the matter laid against him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,17);</script>When therefore they had come
together here, I didn’t delay, but on the next day sat on the judgment
seat, and commanded the man to be brought. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,18);</script>Concerning whom, when the
accusers stood up, they brought no charge of such things as I supposed;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(25,19);</script>but had certain
questions against him about their own religion, and about one Jesus, who
was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,20);</script>Being perplexed how to inquire
concerning these things, I asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem
and there be judged concerning these matters. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,21);</script>But when Paul had appealed to be
kept for the decision of the emperor, I commanded him to be kept until I
could send him to Caesar.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,22);</script>Agrippa said to
Festus, “I also would like to hear the man myself.”
<p>“Tomorrow,” he said, “you shall hear him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,23);</script>So on the next day,
when Agrippa and Bernice had come with great pomp, and they had entered
into the place of hearing with the commanding officers and principal men
of the city, at the command of Festus, Paul was brought in. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,24);</script>Festus said, “King Agrippa,
and all men who are here present with us, you see this man, about whom all
the multitude of the Jews petitioned me, both at Jerusalem and here,
crying that he ought not to live any longer. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,25);</script>But when I found that he had
committed nothing worthy of death, and as he himself appealed to the
emperor I determined to send him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,26);</script>Of whom I have no certain thing
to write to my lord. Therefore I have brought him forth before you, and
especially before you, King Agrippa, that, after examination, I may have
something to write. <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,27);</script>For
it seems to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not to also specify
the charges against him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,1);</script>Agrippa said to Paul,
“You may speak for yourself.”
<p>Then Paul stretched out his hand, and made his defense. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,2);</script>“I think myself happy, King
Agrippa, that I am to make my defense before you this day concerning all
the things that I am accused by the Jews, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,3);</script>especially because you are expert
in all customs and questions which are among the Jews. Therefore I beg you
to hear me patiently.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,4);</script>“Indeed, all the
Jews know my way of life from my youth up, which was from the beginning
among my own nation and at Jerusalem; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,5);</script>having known me from the first,
if they are willing to testify, that after the strictest sect of our
religion I lived a Pharisee. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,6);</script>Now I stand here to be judged for
the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,7);</script>which our twelve tribes,
earnestly serving night and day, hope to attain. Concerning this hope I am
accused by the Jews, King Agrippa! <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,8);</script>Why is it judged incredible with
you, if God does raise the dead?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,9);</script>“I myself most
certainly thought that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of
Jesus of Nazareth. <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,10);</script>This
I also did in Jerusalem. I both shut up many of the saints in prisons,
having received authority from the chief priests, and when they were put
to death I gave my vote against them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,11);</script>Punishing them often in all the
synagogues, I tried to make them blaspheme. Being exceedingly enraged
against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,12);</script>“Whereupon as I
traveled to Damascus with the authority and commission from the chief
priests, <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,13);</script>at noon, O
king, I saw on the way a light from the sky, brighter than the sun,
shining around me and those who traveled with me. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,14);</script>When we had all fallen to the
earth, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language, <span
class="j">‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to
kick against the goads.’</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,15);</script>“I said, ‘Who are
you, Lord?’
<p>“He said, <span class="j">‘I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(26,16);</script>But arise, and stand on
your feet, for I have appeared to you for this purpose: to appoint you a
servant and a witness both of the things which you have seen, and of the
things which I will reveal to you; <script
type="text/javascript">cj(26,17);</script>delivering you from the people,
and from the Gentiles, to whom I send you, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(26,18);</script>to open their eyes, that they
may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that
they may receive remission of sins and an inheritance among those who are
sanctified by faith in me.’</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,19);</script>“Therefore, King
Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,20);</script>but declared first to them of
Damascus, at Jerusalem, and throughout all the country of Judea, and also
to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, doing works
worthy of repentance. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,21);</script>For this reason the Jews seized
me in the temple, and tried to kill me. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,22);</script>Having therefore obtained the
help that is from God, I stand to this day testifying both to small and
great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would happen,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(26,23);</script>how the Christ must
suffer, and how, by the resurrection of the dead, he would be first to
proclaim light both to these people and to the Gentiles.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,24);</script>As he thus made his
defense, Festus said with a loud voice, “Paul, you are crazy! Your great
learning is driving you insane!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,25);</script>But he said, “I am
not crazy, most excellent Festus, but boldly declare words of truth and
reasonableness. <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,26);</script>For the
king knows of these things, to whom also I speak freely. For I am
persuaded that none of these things is hidden from him, for this has not
been done in a corner. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,27);</script>King Agrippa, do you believe the
prophets? I know that you believe.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,28);</script>Agrippa said to Paul,
“With a little persuasion are you trying to make me a Christian?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,29);</script>Paul said, “I pray
to God, that whether with little or with much, not only you, but also all
that hear me this day, might become such as I am, except for these
bonds.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,30);</script>The king rose up with
the governor, and Bernice, and those who sat with them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,31);</script>When they had withdrawn, they
spoke one to another, saying, “This man does nothing worthy of death or
of bonds.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,32);</script>Agrippa
said to Festus, “This man might have been set free if he had not
appealed to Caesar.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,1);</script>When it was determined
that we should sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other
prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of the Augustan band. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,2);</script>Embarking in a ship of
Adramyttium, which was about to sail to places on the coast of Asia, we
put to sea; Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(27,3);</script>The next day, we touched
at Sidon. Julius treated Paul kindly, and gave him permission to go to his
friends and refresh himself. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,4);</script>Putting to sea from there, we
sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,5);</script>When we had sailed across the sea
which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(27,6);</script>There the centurion found
a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy, and he put us on board. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,7);</script>When we had sailed slowly many
days, and had come with difficulty opposite Cnidus, the wind not allowing
us further, we sailed under the lee of Crete, opposite Salmone. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,8);</script>With difficulty sailing along it
we came to a certain place called Fair Havens, near the city of Lasea.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,9);</script>When much time had
passed and the voyage was now dangerous, because the Fast had now already
gone by, Paul admonished them, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,10);</script>and said to them, “Sirs, I
perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of
the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,11);</script>But the centurion gave more heed
to the master and to the owner of the ship than to those things which were
spoken by Paul. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,12);</script>Because
the haven was not suitable to winter in, the majority advised going to sea
from there, if by any means they could reach Phoenix, and winter there,
which is a port of Crete, looking northeast and southeast.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,13);</script>When the south wind
blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed
anchor and sailed along Crete, close to shore. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,14);</script>But before long, a stormy wind
beat down from shore, which is called <a href="#N78">Euroclydon.</a>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(27,15);</script>When the ship was
caught, and couldn’t face the wind, we gave way to it, and were driven
along. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,16);</script>Running under the
lee of a small island called Clauda, we were able, with difficulty, to
secure the boat. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,17);</script>After
they had hoisted it up, they used cables to help reinforce the ship.
Fearing that they would run aground on the Syrtis sand bars, they lowered
the sea anchor, and so were driven along. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,18);</script>As we labored exceedingly with
the storm, the next day they began to throw things overboard. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,19);</script>On the third day, they threw out
the ship’s tackle with their own hands. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,20);</script>When neither sun nor stars shone
on us for many days, and no small storm pressed on us, all hope that we
would be saved was now taken away.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,21);</script>When they had been
long without food, Paul stood up in the middle of them, and said, “Sirs,
you should have listened to me, and not have set sail from Crete, and have
gotten this injury and loss. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,22);</script>Now I exhort you to cheer up,
for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,23);</script>For there stood by me this night
an angel, belonging to the God whose I am and whom I serve, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,24);</script>saying, ‘Don’t be afraid,
Paul. You must stand before Caesar. Behold, God has granted you all those
who sail with you.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,25);</script>Therefore, sirs, cheer up! For I
believe God, that it will be just as it has been spoken to me. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,26);</script>But we must run aground on a
certain island.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,27);</script>But when the
fourteenth night had come, as we were driven back and forth in the
Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors surmised that they were drawing
near to some land. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,28);</script>They
took soundings, and found <a href="#N79">twenty fathoms.</a> After a
little while, they took soundings again, and found <a href="#N80">fifteen
fathoms.</a> <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,29);</script>Fearing
that we would run aground on rocky ground, they let go four anchors from
the stern, and wished for daylight. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,30);</script>As the sailors were trying to
flee out of the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea, pretending
that they would lay out anchors from the bow, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,31);</script>Paul said to the centurion and
to the soldiers, “Unless these stay in the ship, you can’t be
saved.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,32);</script>Then the
soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat, and let it fall off.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,33);</script>While the day was
coming on, Paul begged them all to take some food, saying, “This day is
the fourteenth day that you wait and continue fasting, having taken
nothing. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,34);</script>Therefore I beg
you to take some food, for this is for your safety; for not a hair will
perish from any of your heads.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,35);</script>When he had said this, and had
taken bread, he gave thanks to God in the presence of all, and he broke
it, and began to eat. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,36);</script>Then they all cheered up, and
they also took food. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,37);</script>In
all, we were two hundred seventy-six souls on the ship. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,38);</script>When they had eaten enough, they
lightened the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,39);</script>When it was day, they didn’t
recognize the land, but they noticed a certain bay with a beach, and they
decided to try to drive the ship onto it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,40);</script>Casting off the anchors, they
left them in the sea, at the same time untying the rudder ropes. Hoisting
up the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,41);</script>But coming to a place where two
seas met, they ran the vessel aground. The bow struck and remained
immovable, but the stern began to break up by the violence of the waves.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,42);</script>The soldiers’
counsel was to kill the prisoners, so that none of them would swim out and
escape. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,43);</script>But the
centurion, desiring to save Paul, stopped them from their purpose, and
commanded that those who could swim should throw themselves overboard
first to go toward the land; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,44);</script>and the rest should follow, some
on planks, and some on other things from the ship. So it happened that
they all escaped safely to the land.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,1);</script>When we had escaped,
then <a href="#N81">they</a> learned that the island was called Malta.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(28,2);</script>The natives showed us
uncommon kindness; for they kindled a fire, and received us all, because
of the present rain, and because of the cold. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,3);</script>But when Paul had gathered a
bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out because of
the heat, and fastened on his hand. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,4);</script>When the natives saw the creature
hanging from his hand, they said one to another, “No doubt this man is a
murderer, whom, though he has escaped from the sea, yet Justice has not
allowed to live.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,5);</script>However he shook off the creature
into the fire, and wasn’t harmed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,6);</script>But they expected that he would
have swollen or fallen down dead suddenly, but when they watched for a
long time and saw nothing bad happen to him, they changed their minds, and
said that he was a god.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,7);</script>Now in the
neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the
island, named Publius, who received us, and courteously entertained us for
three days. <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,8);</script>It happened
that the father of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery. Paul entered
in to him, prayed, and laying his hands on him, healed him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,9);</script>Then when this was done, the rest
also who had diseases in the island came, and were cured. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,10);</script>They also honored us with many
honors, and when we sailed, they put on board the things that we needed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,11);</script>After three months,
we set sail in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island,
whose sign was “The Twin Brothers.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,12);</script>Touching at Syracuse, we stayed
there three days. <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,13);</script>From
there we circled around and arrived at Rhegium. After one day, a south
wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,14);</script>where we found <a
href="#N82">brothers,</a> and were entreated to stay with them for seven
days. So we came to Rome. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,15);</script>From there the brothers, when
they heard of us, came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The
Three Taverns. When Paul saw them, he thanked God, and took courage.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(28,16);</script>When we entered into
Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard,
but Paul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier who guarded him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,17);</script>It happened that
after three days Paul called together those who were the leaders of the
Jews. When they had come together, he said to them, “I, brothers, though
I had done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers,
still was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(28,18);</script>who, when they had
examined me, desired to set me free, because there was no cause of death
in me. <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,19);</script>But when the Jews
spoke against it, I was constrained to appeal to Caesar, not that I had
anything about which to accuse my nation. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,20);</script>For this cause therefore I asked
to see you and to speak with you. For because of the hope of Israel I am
bound with this chain.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,21);</script>They said to him,
“We neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor did any of
the brothers come here and report or speak any evil of you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,22);</script>But we desire to hear from you
what you think. For, as concerning this sect, it is known to us that
everywhere it is spoken against.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,23);</script>When they had
appointed him a day, many people came to him at his lodging. He explained
to them, testifying about the Kingdom of God, and persuading them
concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses and from the prophets, from
morning until evening. <script
