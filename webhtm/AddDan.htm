The Book of Daniel (Translated from the Greek Septuagint)
</h1><p>
 <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,1);</script>In the third year of the
reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to
Jerusalem and besieged it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,2);</script>The Lord gave Jehoiakim king of
Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of God’s house; and he
carried them into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he
brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,3);</script>The king spoke to
Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring in certain of the
children of Israel, even of the royal line and of the nobles, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,4);</script>youths in whom there was no
blemish, but who were well-favored and skillful in all wisdom, and endowed
with knowledge and understanding science, and such as had the ability to
stand in the king’s palace; and that he should teach them the learning
and the language of the Chaldeans. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,5);</script>The king appointed for them a
daily portion of the king’s delicacies and of the wine which he drank,
so that they would be nourished for three years and at its end they would
stand before the king. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,6);</script>Now
among these were, of the children of Judah: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and
Azariah. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,7);</script>The prince of the
eunuchs gave names to them: to Daniel, he gave the name of Belteshazzar;
and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah,
of Abednego. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,8);</script>But Daniel
decided in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king’s
delicacies, nor with the wine which he drank; therefore he requested of
the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,9);</script>Now God caused Daniel
to find kindness and compassion in the sight of the prince of the eunuchs.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,10);</script>The prince of the eunuchs
said to Daniel, “I fear my lord the king, who has appointed your food
and your drink, for why should he see your faces looking worse than the
youths who are of your own age? So would you endanger my head with the
king.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,11);</script>Then Daniel said
to the steward, whom the prince of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel,
Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,12);</script>“Test your servants, I beg you,
for ten days; and let them give us roots to eat and water to drink.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,13);</script>Then let our faces be
examined before you, and the face of the youths who eat of the king’s
delicacies; and as you see, deal with your servants.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,14);</script>So he listened to them in this
matter and tested them for ten days. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,15);</script>At the end of ten days their
faces appeared fairer and they were fatter in flesh than all the youths
who ate of the king’s delicacies. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,16);</script>So the steward took away their
delicacies and the wine that they should drink, and gave them roots.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,17);</script>Now as for these four
youths, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom; and
Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,18);</script>At the end of the days which the
king had appointed for bringing them in, the prince of the eunuchs brought
them in before Nebuchadnezzar. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,19);</script>The king talked with them; and
among them all none was found like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah;
therefore they stood before the king. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,20);</script>In every matter of wisdom and
understanding, concerning which the king inquired of them, he found them
ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters who were in all his
realm. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,21);</script>Daniel continued
even to the first year of king Cyrus.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,1);</script>In the second year of
the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams; and his spirit
was troubled and his sleep went from him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,2);</script>Then the king commanded to call
the magicians, the enchanters, the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, to tell
the king his dreams. So they came in and stood before the king.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,3);</script>The king said to them,
“I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream.”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,4);</script>Then the Chaldeans spoke
to the king in the Syrian language, “O king, live forever! Tell your
servants the dream and we will show the interpretation.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,5);</script>The king answered the Chaldeans,
“The thing is forgotten by me; if you don’t make it known to me, the
dream and its interpretation, you shall be cut in pieces and your houses
shall be made a dunghill. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,6);</script>But if you show the dream and its
interpretation, you shall receive from me gifts and rewards and great
honor; therefore show me the dream and its interpretation.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,7);</script>They answered the second time and
said, “Let the king tell his servants the dream and we will show the
interpretation.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,8);</script>The
king answered, “I know with certainty that you are stalling for time,
because you see the thing is forgotten by me. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,9);</script>But if you don’t make known to
me the dream, there is but one law for you: for you have prepared lying
and corrupt words to speak before me, until the time be changed; therefore
tell me the dream and I shall know that you can show me its
interpretation.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,10);</script>The
Chaldeans answered before the king and said, “There is not a man on
earth who can reveal the king’s mind, because no king, lord, or ruler
has asked such a thing of any magician, or enchanter, or Chaldean. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,11);</script>It is an unusual thing that the
king requires, and there is no one who can reveal it to the king, except
the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,12);</script>For this reason, the
king was angry and very furious, and he commanded the destruction of all
the wise men of Babylon. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,13);</script>So the decree went forth and the
wise men were to be slain; and they sought Daniel and his companions to be
slain. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,14);</script>Then Daniel
returned answer with counsel and prudence to Arioch the captain of the
king’s guard, who had gone forth to kill the wise men of Babylon;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,15);</script>he answered Arioch the
king’s captain, “Why is the decree so urgent from the king?” Then
Arioch made the thing known to Daniel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,16);</script>Daniel went in and requested of
the king, that if he would appoint him a time, he would show the king the
interpretation.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,17);</script>Then Daniel went to
his house and made the matter known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his
companions, <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,18);</script>so that they
would ask for mercies from the God of heaven concerning this secret; so
that Daniel and his companions would not perish with the rest of the wise
men of Babylon. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,19);</script>Then was
the secret revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night. Then Daniel
blessed the God of heaven. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,20);</script>Daniel answered,
<dl>
<dt>“Blessed be the name of God
<dd>forever and ever;
<dd>for wisdom and might are his.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,21);</script>He changes the times
and the seasons;
<dd>he removes kings and sets up kings;
<dd>he gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those who have
understanding;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,22);</script>he reveals the deep
and secret things;
<dd>he knows what is in the darkness,
<dd>and the light dwells with him.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,23);</script>I thank you and
praise you, the God of my fathers,
<dd>who has given me wisdom and might,
<dd>and has now made known to me what we desired of you;
<dd>for you have made known to us the king’s mind.”
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,24);</script>Therefore Daniel went
in to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of
Babylon; he went and said this to him: “Don’t destroy the wise men of
Babylon; bring me in before the king and I will reveal the interpretation
to the king.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,25);</script>Then
Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste and said this to him,
“I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Judah, who will
make known to the king the interpretation.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,26);</script>The king answered
Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, “Are you able to make known to me
the dream which I have seen, and its interpretation?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,27);</script>Daniel answered before
the king and said, “The secret which the king has demanded neither wise
men, enchanters, magicians, nor soothsayers, can reveal to the king;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,28);</script>but there is a God in
heaven who reveals secrets, and he has made known to the king
Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in latter days; your dream and the visions of
your head on your bed are such as these.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,29);</script>“As for you, O king,
your thoughts came into your mind on your bed, what should happen
hereafter; and he who reveals secrets has made known to you what shall
happen. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,30);</script>But as for me,
this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any
living, but to the intent that the interpretation may be made known to the
king, and that you may know the thoughts of your heart.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,31);</script>“You, O king, saw,
and behold, a great image. This image, which was mighty and whose
brightness was excellent, stood before you; and its aspect was awesome.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,32);</script>As for this image, its
head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and
its thighs of brass, <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,33);</script>its
legs of iron, its feet part of iron and part of clay. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,34);</script>You looked on until a stone was
cut out without hands; it struck the image on its feet that were of iron
and clay and broke them in pieces. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,35);</script>Then the iron, the clay, the
brass, the silver, and the gold, was broken in pieces together and became
like the chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them
away, so that no place was found for them; and the stone that struck the
image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,36);</script>This is the dream and we will
tell its interpretation before the king.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,37);</script>“You, O king, are
king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power,
and the strength and the glory; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,38);</script>and wherever the children of men
dwell, he has given the animals of the field and the birds of the sky into
your hand and has made you to rule over them all; you are the head of
gold. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,39);</script>After you another
kingdom shall arise inferior to you; and another third kingdom of brass,
which shall bear rule over all the earth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,40);</script>The fourth kingdom shall be
strong as iron, because iron breaks in pieces and subdues all things; and
as iron crushes all these, so shall it break in pieces and crush. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,41);</script>Whereas you saw the feet and
toes, part of potters’ clay and part of iron, it shall be a divided
kingdom; but there shall be in it the strength of iron, because you saw
the iron mixed with miry clay. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,42);</script>As the toes of the feet were part
of iron and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly
broken. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,43);</script>Whereas you saw
the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the
offspring of men; but they shall not cling to one another, even as iron
does not mingle with clay.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,44);</script>“In the days of
those kings, the God of heaven shall set up a kingdom which shall never be
destroyed, nor shall its sovereignty be left to another people; but it
shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand
forever. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,45);</script>Because you saw
that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke
in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the
great God has made known to the king what shall happen hereafter; and the
dream is certain and its interpretation sure.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,46);</script>Then the king
Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face and worshiped Daniel, and he commanded
that they should offer an oblation and fragrant incense to him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,47);</script>The king answered Daniel and
said, “Truly, your God is the God of gods and the Lord of kings and a
revealer of secrets, since you have been able to reveal this secret.”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,48);</script>Then the king made Daniel
great and gave him many great gifts, and he made him ruler over the whole
province of Babylon and the chief governor over all the wise men of
Babylon. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,49);</script>Daniel requested
of the king, and so he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the
affairs of the province of Babylon; but Daniel was in the gate of the king.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,1);</script>Nebuchadnezzar the king
made an image of gold, whose height was sixty cubits and its breadth six
cubits; he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,2);</script>Then Nebuchadnezzar the
king sent to gather together the satraps, the deputies, and the governors,
the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all the
rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image, which
Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,3);</script>Then the satraps, the deputies,
and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counselors, the
sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces were gathered together for
the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and
they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,4);</script>Then the herald cried
aloud, “To you it is commanded, peoples, nations, and languages, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,5);</script>that whenever you hear the sound
of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe, and all kinds of music, you
fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has
set up; <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,6);</script>and whoever
doesn’t fall down and worship shall the same hour be cast into the midst
of a burning fiery furnace.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,7);</script>Therefore at that time, when all
the peoples heard the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe,
and all kinds of music, all the peoples, the nations, and the languages,
fell down and worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had
set up.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,8);</script>Therefore at that time
certain Chaldeans came near and brought accusation against the Jews.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,9);</script>They spoke and said to
Nebuchadnezzar the king, “O king, live for ever. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,10);</script>You, O king, have made a decree,
that every man who hears the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp,
pipe, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden
image; <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,11);</script>and whoever
doesn’t fall down and worship shall be cast into the midst of a burning
fiery furnace. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,12);</script>There are
certain Jews, whom you have appointed over the affairs of the province of
Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; these men, O king, have
disregarded you; they don’t serve your gods, nor worship the golden
image which you have set up.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,13);</script>Then Nebuchadnezzar in
his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then
they brought these men before the king. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,14);</script>Nebuchadnezzar answered them,
“Is it on purpose, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you don’t
serve my god, nor worship the golden image which I have set up? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,15);</script>If you are now ready, whenever
you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe, and all
kinds of music, to fall down and worship the image which I have made, it
is well. But if you don’t worship, you shall be cast the same hour into
the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that god who shall
deliver you out of my hands?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,16);</script>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego
answered the king, “Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in
this matter. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,17);</script>If it be so,
our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery
furnace; and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,18);</script>But if not, be it known to you, O
king, that we will not serve your gods, nor worship the golden image which
you have set up.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,19);</script>Then Nebuchadnezzar
was full of fury, and the form of his appearance was changed against
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Therefore he spoke and commanded that
they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was usually heated.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,20);</script>He commanded certain
mighty men, who were in his army, to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,
and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,21);</script>Then these men were bound in
their pants, their tunics, and their mantles, and their other garments,
and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,22);</script>Therefore because the king’s
commandment was urgent and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the
fire killed those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,23);</script>These three men, Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery
furnace.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,24);</script>And they walked in the
midst of the fire, praising God and blessing the Lord. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,25);</script>Then Azariah stood up and prayed
in this way; and opening his mouth in the midst of the fire, he said,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,26);</script>“Blessed are you, O
Lord God of our fathers; your name is worthy to be praised and glorified
for evermore: <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,27);</script>For you are
righteous in all the things which you have done to us; yes, true are all
your works, your ways are right, and all your judgments are truth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,28);</script>In all the things which you have
brought upon us and upon the holy city of our fathers, even Jerusalem, you
have executed true judgment; for according to truth and judgment you
brought all these things upon us because of our sins. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,29);</script>For we have sinned and committed
iniquity, departing from you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,30);</script>In all things have we trespassed
and not obeyed your commandments, nor kept them, neither have we done as
you have commanded us, so that it might go well with us. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,31);</script>Therefore all that you have
brought upon us and everything which you have done to us, you have done in
true judgment. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,32);</script>And you
delivered us into the hands of lawless enemies, most hateful forsakers of
God, and to an unjust king, the most wicked in all the world. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,33);</script>And now we cannot open our
mouths; we have become a shame and a reproach to your servants and to
those who worship you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,34);</script>Yet do not deliver us up
completely, for your name’s sake, nor completely annul your covenant.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,35);</script>And do not cause your
mercy to depart from us, for your beloved Abraham’s sake, for your
servant Isaac’s sake, and for your holy Israel’s sake, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,36);</script>to whom you have spoken and
promised that you would multiply their seed as the stars of heaven and as
the sand which lies upon the seashore. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,37);</script>For we, O Lord, have become less
than any nation and are oppressed this day in all the world because of our
sins. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,38);</script>Neither is there at
this time any prince, or prophet, or leader, or burnt offering, or
sacrifice, or oblation, or incense, or place, to sacrifice before you in
order to find mercy. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,39);</script>Nevertheless, with a contrite
heart and a humble spirit, let us be accepted. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,40);</script>Just as in the burnt offerings of
rams and bullocks, and just as in ten thousands of fat lambs, so let it be
with our sacrifice in your sight on this day; and grant that we may
completely follow you, for those who put their trust in you shall not be
confounded. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,41);</script>And now we
follow you with all our heart; we fear you and seek your face. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,42);</script>Do not put us to shame, but deal
with us according to your loving kindness and according to the multitude
of your mercies. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,43);</script>Deliver
us also according to your marvelous works and give glory to your name, O
Lord; and let all those who do harm to your servants be ashamed; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,44);</script>and let them be confounded in all
their power and might, and let their strength be broken; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,45);</script>and let them know that you are
God, the only God, and glorious over the whole world.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,46);</script>And the king’s
servants, who put them in, continued to make the oven hot with resin,
pitch, tow, and small wood, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,47);</script>so that the flame streamed forth
above the furnace for forty nine cubits. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,48);</script>And it passed through and burned
those Chaldeans it found around the furnace. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,49);</script>But the angel of the Lord came
down into the oven, together with Azariah and his peers, and drove the
flame of the fire out of the oven, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,50);</script>and made the middle of the
furnace like a moist whistling wind, so that the fire didn’t touch them
at all and neither hurt nor troubled them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,51);</script>Then the three, as out of one
mouth, praised, glorified, and blessed God in the furnace, saying:
<dl>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,52);</script>“Blessed are you, O
Lord God of our fathers;
<dd>and praised and exalted above all for ever.
<dt>And blessed is your glorious and holy name;
<dd>and praised and exalted above all for ever.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,53);</script>Blessed are you in
the temple of your holy glory;
<dd>and praised and glorified above all for ever.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,54);</script>Blessed are you on
the glorious throne of your kingdom;
<dd>and praised and glorified above all for ever.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,55);</script>Blessed are you, who
beholds the abyss while sitting upon the cherubims;
<dd>and praised and exalted above all for ever.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,56);</script>Blessed are you in
the firmament of heaven;
<dd>and above all praised and glorified for ever.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,57);</script>All works of the

</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,91);</script>Then Nebuchadnezzar
the king was astonished and rose up in haste. He spoke and said to his
counselors, “Didn’t we cast three men bound into the midst of the
fire?” They answered the king, “True, O king.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,92);</script>He answered, “Look, I see four
men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they are unharmed; and
the aspect of the fourth is like a son of god!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,93);</script>Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to
the mouth of the burning fiery furnace. He spoke and said, “Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego, you servants of the Most High God, come forth and
come here. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came forth out of the
midst of the fire.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,94);</script>The satraps, the
deputies, and the governors, and the king’s counselors, who were
gathered together, saw these men, that the fire had no power on their
bodies, nor was the hair of their head singed, neither were their pants
changed, nor had the smell of fire passed onto them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,95);</script>Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said,
“Blessed is the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his
angel and delivered his servants who trusted in him and have changed the
king’s word and have yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor
worship any god, except their own God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,96);</script>Therefore I make a decree: that
every people, nation, and language, who speaks anything evil against the
God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces and their
houses shall be made a dunghill, because there is no other god who is able
to deliver in this way.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,97);</script>Then the king promoted Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,1);</script><font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N1">*</a></sup></font>“Nebuchadnezzar the king,
to all the peoples, nations, and languages, who dwell in all the earth:
Peace be multiplied to you.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,2);</script>“It has seemed good
to me to reveal the signs and wonders which the Most High God has worked
toward me. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,3);</script>How great are
his signs and how mighty are his wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting
kingdom and his dominion is from generation to generation.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,4);</script>“I, Nebuchadnezzar,
was at peace in my house and flourishing in my palace. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,5);</script>I saw a dream which made me
afraid; and the thoughts on my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,6);</script>Therefore I made a decree
to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, so that they might make
known to me the interpretation of the dream. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,7);</script>Then the magicians, the
enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers came in; and I told the
dream to them, but they didn’t make known to me its interpretation.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,8);</script>But at last Daniel came in
before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god,
and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and I told the dream to him,
saying:<br>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,9);</script>‘Belteshazzar, master of
the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you
and no secret troubles you, tell me the visions of my dream which I have
seen and its interpretation. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,10);</script>Thus were the visions of my head
on my bed: I saw, and behold, a tree in the midst of the earth and its
height was great. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,11);</script>The
tree grew and was strong and its height reached to the sky and its sight
to the end of all the earth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,12);</script>The leaves of it were beautiful
and its fruit plentiful, and in it was food for all; the animals of the
field had shadow under it, and the birds of the sky lived in its branches,
and all flesh was fed from it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,13);</script>I saw in the visions of my head
on my bed, and behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from the sky.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,14);</script>“‘He cried aloud,
and said thus, “Cut down the tree and cut off its branches, shake off
its leaves and scatter its fruit; let the animals get away from under it
and the birds from its branches. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,15);</script>Nevertheless leave the stump of
its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender
grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of the sky; and let his
portion be with the animals in the grass of the earth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,16);</script>Let his heart be changed from
man’s, and let an animal’s heart be given to him; and let seven times
pass over him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,17);</script>This
sentence is by decree of the watchers, and this demand by the word of the
holy ones; to the intent that the living may know that the Most High rules
in the kingdom of men and gives it to whomever he will and sets up over it
the lowest of men.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,18);</script>This dream I, king
Nebuchadnezzar, have seen; and you, Belteshazzar, declare the
interpretation, because all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to
make known to me the interpretation; but you are able, for the spirit of
the holy gods is in you.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,19);</script>Then Daniel, whose
name was Belteshazzar, was stricken mute for a while and his thoughts
troubled him. The king answered, “Belteshazzar, don’t let the dream or
the interpretation trouble you.”
<p>Belteshazzar answered, “My lord, the dream is for those who hate you
and its interpretation is for your adversaries. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,20);</script>The tree that you saw, which grew
and was strong, whose height reached to the sky and its sight to all the
earth, <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,21);</script>whose leaves were
beautiful and its fruit plentiful, and in it was food for all; under which
the animals of the field lived, and on whose branches the birds of the sky
had their habitation; <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,22);</script>it
is you, O king, who has grown and become strong; for your greatness is
grown and reaches to the sky, and your dominion to the end of the earth.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,23);</script>Whereas the king saw a
watcher and a holy one coming down from the sky, and saying, ‘Cut down
the tree, and destroy it; nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the
earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the
field, and let it be wet with the dew of the sky; and let his portion be
with the animals of the field, until seven times pass over him.’
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,24);</script>“This is the
interpretation, O king, and it is the decree of the Most High, which has
come upon my lord the king, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,25);</script>that you shall be driven from men
and your dwelling shall be with the animals of the field and you shall be
made to eat grass as oxen, and shall be wet with the dew of the sky, and
seven times shall pass over you; until you know that the Most High rules
in the kingdom of men and gives it to whomever he will. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,26);</script>Whereas they commanded to leave
the stump of the roots of the tree, your kingdom shall be safeguarded for
you, after you have understood that the heavens rule. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,27);</script>Therefore, O king, let my counsel
be acceptable to you and break away from your sins by means of
righteousness, and from your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; so
that there may be a lengthening of your tranquility.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,28);</script>All this came on the king
Nebuchadnezzar.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,29);</script>At the end of twelve
months he was walking in the royal palace of Babylon. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,30);</script>The king spoke and said, “Is
this not great Babylon, which I have built for the royal dwelling place by
the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,31);</script>While the word was in the
king’s mouth, there fell a voice from the sky, saying, “O king
Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken: The kingdom is separated from you,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,32);</script>and you shall be driven
from men; and your dwelling shall be with the animals of the field; you
shall be made to eat grass as oxen; and seven times shall pass over you,
until you know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men and gives it
to whomever he will.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,33);</script>The same hour this was fulfilled
for Nebuchadnezzar; and he was driven from men, and ate grass as oxen, and
his body was wet with the dew of the sky, until his hair was grown like
eagles’ feathers and his nails like birds’ claws.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,34);</script>“At the end of the
days, I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up my eyes to heaven and my understanding
returned to me, and I blessed the Most High and I praised and honored him
who lives forever; for his dominion is an everlasting dominion and his
kingdom from generation to generation. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,35);</script>All the inhabitants of the earth
count as nothing; and he does according to his will in the army of heaven,
and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand or say
to him, ‘What are you doing?’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,36);</script>At the same time my understanding
returned to me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and brightness
returned to me; and my counselors and my lords searched for me; and I was
established in my kingdom and excellent greatness was added to me. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,37);</script>Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and
extol and honor the King of heaven; for all his works are Truth and his
ways Justice; and those who walk in pride, he is able to abase.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,1);</script>Belshazzar the king
made a great feast for a thousand of his lords, and he drank wine before
the thousand. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,2);</script>Belshazzar,
while he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels
which Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the Temple which was in
Jerusalem; so that the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines,
might drink from them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,3);</script>Then they brought the golden
vessels, which were taken out of the Temple of God’s house which was at
Jerusalem; and the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines, drank
from them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,4);</script>They drank wine
and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood,
and of stone.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,5);</script>In the same hour, the
fingers of a man’s hand came forth and wrote, opposite the lamp stand,
on the plaster of the wall of the king’s palace; and the king saw the
part of the hand that wrote. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,6);</script>Then the king’s face was changed
in him and his thoughts troubled him; and the joints of his thighs were
loosened and his knees struck one against another. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,7);</script>The king cried aloud to bring in
the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. The king spoke and
said to the wise men of Babylon, “Whoever shall read this writing and
show me its interpretation shall be clothed with purple and have a chain
of gold around his neck and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,8);</script>Then all the king’s
wise men came in; but they could not read the writing, nor make known to
the king the interpretation. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,9);</script>Then king Belshazzar was greatly
troubled and his face was changed in him, and his lords were perplexed.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(5,10);</script>Now the queen, because of
the words of the king and his lords, came into the banquet house. The
queen spoke and said, “O king, live forever; don’t let your thoughts
trouble you, nor let your face be changed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,11);</script>There is a man in your kingdom,
in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and, in the days of your father,
light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, were
found in him; and the king Nebuchadnezzar your father, the king, I say,
your father, made him master of the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and
soothsayers, <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,12);</script>because an
excellent spirit and knowledge and understanding, interpreting dreams and
revealing dark judgments and dissolving doubts, were found in the same
Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called and he
will show the interpretation.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,13);</script>Then Daniel was
brought in before the king. The king spoke and said to Daniel, “Are you
that Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the
king my father brought out of Judah? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,14);</script>I have heard of you, that the
spirit of the gods is in you, and that light and understanding and
excellent wisdom are found in you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,15);</script>Now the wise men, the enchanters,
have been brought in before me, so that they would read this writing and
make known to me its interpretation; but they could not show the
interpretation of the thing. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,16);</script>But I have heard of you, that you
can give interpretations and dissolve doubts; now if you can read the
writing and make known to me its interpretation, you shall be clothed with
purple and have a chain of gold around your neck and shall be the third
ruler in the kingdom.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,17);</script>Then Daniel answered
before the king, “Let your gifts be for yourself and give your rewards
to another; nevertheless, I will read the writing to the king and make
known to him the interpretation. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,18);</script>You, king, the Most High God gave
Nebuchadnezzar your father the kingdom and greatness and glory and
majesty; <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,19);</script>and because of
the greatness that he gave him, all the peoples, nations, and languages
trembled and feared before him. Whom he would, he killed, and whom he
would, he kept alive; and whom he would, he raised up, and whom he would,
he put down. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,20);</script>But when his
heart was lifted up and his spirit was hardened, so that he behaved
proudly, he was deposed from his kingly throne and they took his glory
from him; <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,21);</script>and he was
driven from the sons of men and his heart was made like the animals’,
and his dwelling was with the wild donkeys; he was fed with grass like
oxen and his body was wet with the dew of the sky; until he knew that the
Most High God rules in the kingdom of men, and that he sets up over it
whomever he will. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,22);</script>You,
his son, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, though you knew all
this, <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,23);</script>but have lifted up
yourself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of
his House before you; and you and your lords, your wives and your
concubines, have drunk wine from them; and you have praised the gods of
silver and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which do not see, nor
hear, nor know; yet the God in whose hand your breath is, and whose are
all your ways, you have not glorified. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,24);</script>Then the part of the hand was
sent from before him, and this writing was inscribed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,25);</script>This is the writing that was
inscribed: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,26);</script>This is the interpretation of the
thing: MENE; God has numbered your kingdom and brought it to an end;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(5,27);</script>TEKEL; you are weighed in
the balances and are found wanting. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,28);</script>PERES; your kingdom is divided
and given to the Medes and Persians.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,29);</script>Then Belshazzar
commanded, and they clothed Daniel with purple and put a chain of gold
around his neck and made proclamation concerning him, so that he would be
the third ruler in the kingdom. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,30);</script>In that night Belshazzar the
Chaldean king was slain. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,31);</script>Darius the Mede received the
kingdom; he was about sixty-two years old.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,1);</script>It pleased Darius to
set over the kingdom one hundred twenty satraps, who would be throughout
the whole kingdom, <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,2);</script>and
over them three presidents, of whom Daniel was one; so that these satraps
might give account to them, and so that the king would suffer no loss.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(6,3);</script>Then this Daniel was
distinguished above the presidents and the satraps because an excellent
spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,4);</script>Then the presidents and
the satraps sought to find grounds against Daniel concerning the kingdom;
but they could find no grounds nor fault, because he was faithful, neither
was there any error or fault found in him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,5);</script>Then these men said, “We shall
not find any grounds against this Daniel, unless we find it against him
concerning the law of his God.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,6);</script>Then these presidents and satraps
assembled together before the king and said this to him, “King Darius,
live forever. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,7);</script>All the
presidents of the kingdom, the deputies and the satraps, the counselors
and the governors, have consulted together to establish a royal statute
and to make a strong prohibition, that whoever shall ask a petition of any
god or man for thirty days, except of you, O king, he shall be cast into
the den of lions. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,8);</script>Now, O
king, establish the prohibition and sign the writing, so that it cannot be
changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians which doesn’t
alter.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,9);</script>Therefore king
Darius signed the writing and the prohibition.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,10);</script>When Daniel knew that
the writing was signed, he went into his house, (now his windows were open
in his room facing Jerusalem,) and he kneeled on his knees three times a
day, and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as he did before. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,11);</script>Then these men assembled together
and found Daniel making petition and supplication before his God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,12);</script>Then they came near and spoke
before the king concerning the king’s prohibition: “Haven’t you
signed a prohibition, so that every man who shall make petition to any god
or man within thirty days, except to you, O king, shall be cast into the
den of lions?” The king answered, “The thing is true, according to the
law of the Medes and Persians which doesn’t alter.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,13);</script>Then they answered and said
before the king, “That Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity
of Judah, disregards you, O king, and the prohibition which you have
signed, but makes his petition three times a day.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,14);</script>Then the king, when he
heard these words, was very displeased and set his heart on Daniel to
deliver him; and he labored until the going down of the sun to rescue him.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(6,15);</script>Then these men assembled
together before the king and said to the king, “Know, O king, that it is
a law of the Medes and Persians that no prohibition or statute which the
king establishes may be changed.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,16);</script>Then the king commanded, and they
brought Daniel and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spoke and
said to Daniel, “Your God, whom you serve continually, he will deliver
you.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,17);</script>A stone was
brought and laid on the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his
own signet and with the signet of his lords; that nothing might be changed
concerning Daniel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,18);</script>Then the king went to
his palace and passed the night fasting; no instruments of music were
brought before him; and his sleep fled from him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,19);</script>Then the king arose very early in
the morning and went in haste to the den of lions. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,20);</script>When he came near to the den, he
cried to Daniel with a lamentable voice. The king spoke and said to
Daniel, “Daniel, servant of the living God, is your God, whom you serve
continually, able to deliver you from the lions?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,21);</script>Then Daniel said to the king,
“O king, live forever. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,22);</script>My God has sent his angel and has
shut the lions’ mouths and they have not hurt me; because innocence was
found in me before him; and also before you, O king, have I done no
wrong.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,23);</script>Then was the
king exceeding glad and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of
the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no kind of harm was
found in him because he had trusted in his God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,24);</script>The king commanded, and they
brought those men who had accused Daniel and they cast them into the den
of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions overcame
them and broke all their bones in pieces, before they reached the bottom
of the den.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,25);</script>Then king Darius wrote
to all the peoples, nations, and languages, who dwell in all the earth:
“Peace be multiplied to you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,26);</script>I make a decree, that in all the
dominion of my kingdom men shall tremble and fear before the God of
Daniel; for he is the living God and steadfast forever, His kingdom is
that which shall not be destroyed; and his dominion shall be even to the
end. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,27);</script>He delivers and
rescues, and he works signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who has
delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,28);</script>So this Daniel prospered in the
reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,1);</script>In the first year of
Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream and visions in his head on
his bed; then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matter. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,2);</script>Daniel spoke and said, “I saw in
my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of the sky broke forth on
the great sea. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,3);</script>Four great
animals came up from the sea, different one from another. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,4);</script>The first was like a lion and had
eagle’s wings; I watched as its wings were plucked and it was lifted up
from the earth and made to stand on two feet like a man; and a man’s
heart was given to it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,5);</script>Behold, another animal, a second,
like a bear; and it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its
mouth between its teeth; and they said this to it, ‘Arise, devour much
flesh!’ <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,6);</script>After this I
saw, and behold, another, like a leopard, which had on its back four wings
of a bird; the animal had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,7);</script>After this I saw in the
night visions, and behold, a fourth animal, awesome and powerful and
exceedingly strong; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in
pieces and stamped the residue with its feet; and it was different from
all the animals that were before it; and it had ten horns. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,8);</script>I considered the horns, and
behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which
three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots; and behold, in this
horn were eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth speaking great things.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,9);</script>I watched as thrones were
placed, and one who was ancient of days sat; his clothing was white as
snow and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames
and its wheels burning fire. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,10);</script>A fiery stream issued and came
forth from before him; thousands of thousands ministered to him, and ten
thousand times ten thousand stood before him. The judgment was set and the
books were opened. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,11);</script>I saw,
at that time, what became of the voice of the great words which the horn
spoke; I watched even as the animal was slain and its body destroyed and
it was given to be burned with fire. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,12);</script>As for the rest of the animals,
their dominion was taken away, yet their lives were prolonged for a season
and a time.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,13);</script>“I saw in the night
visions, and behold, there came with the clouds of the sky one like a son
of man, and he came even to the ancient of days, and they brought him near
before him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,14);</script>He was given
dominion and glory and a kingdom, so that all the peoples, nations, and
languages would serve him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which
shall not pass away, and his kingdom is that which shall not be destroyed.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,15);</script>As for me, Daniel, my
spirit was grieved in the midst of my body and the visions of my head
troubled me. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,16);</script>I came near
to one of those who stood by and asked him the truth concerning all this.
So he told me and made known to me the interpretation of these things.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,17);</script>“‘These great
animals, which are four, are four kings, who shall arise out of the earth.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,18);</script>But the saints of the
Most High shall receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever, even
forever and ever.’ <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,19);</script>Then
I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth animal, which was
different from all of them and exceedingly terrible, whose teeth were of
iron and its nails of brass; which devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped
the residue with its feet; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,20);</script>and concerning the ten horns
which were on its head, and the other horn which came up, and before which
three fell, and even that horn which had eyes and a mouth which spoke
great things, whose appearance was more powerful than its peers. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,21);</script>I watched as the same horn made
war with the saints and prevailed against them; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,22);</script>until the ancient of days came,
and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High, and the time came
for the saints to possess the kingdom. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,23);</script>Thus he said, ‘The fourth
animal shall be a fourth kingdom on earth, which shall be different from
all the kingdoms and shall devour the whole earth and shall tread it down
and break it in pieces. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,24);</script>As for the ten horns, out of this
kingdom ten kings shall arise; and another shall arise after them; and he
shall be different from the former, and he shall put down three kings.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,25);</script>He shall speak words
against the Most High and shall wear out the saints of the Most High; and
he shall think to change the times and the law; and they shall be given
into his hand until a time and times and half a time. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,26);</script>But the judgment shall be set;
and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it to the
end. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,27);</script>The kingdom and the
dominion and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole sky shall be
given to the people of the saints of the Most High. His kingdom is an
everlasting kingdom and all dominions shall serve and obey him.’
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,28);</script>Here is the end of the
matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts troubled me greatly and my face was
changed in me; but I kept the matter in my heart.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,1);</script>In the third year of
the reign of king Belshazzar, a vision appeared to me, even to me, Daniel,
after that which appeared to me at first. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,2);</script>I saw in a vision; and it came to
pass, when I saw, that I was in Susa the palatial city, which is in the
province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river Ulai.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,3);</script>Then I lifted up my
eyes and saw, and behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two
horns; and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and
the higher one came up last. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,4);</script>I saw the ram advancing westward,
and northward, and southward; and no animals could stand before him,
neither was there any who could deliver out of his hand; but he did
according to his will and magnified himself. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,5);</script>As I was considering, behold, a
male goat came from the west over the surface of the whole earth and
didn’t touch the ground; and the goat had a prominent horn between his
eyes. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,6);</script>He came to the ram
that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the river, and ran
against him in the fury of his power. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,7);</script>I saw him come close to the ram,
and he was moved with anger against him, and struck the ram and broke his
two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him; but he
cast him down to the ground and trampled on him; and there was none who
could deliver the ram out of his hand. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,8);</script>The male goat magnified himself
exceedingly; and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and
instead of it there came up four prominent horns toward the four winds of
the sky.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,9);</script>Out of one of them came
forth a little horn, which grew exceeding great, toward the south and
toward the east and toward the glorious land. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,10);</script>It grew great, even before the
multitude of heaven; and some of the multitude and of the stars it cast
down to the ground and trampled on them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,11);</script>Yes, it magnified itself, even
before the prince of the multitude; and it took away from him the
continual burnt offering, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,12);</script>And a multitude was given
over to it, together with the continual burnt offering by reason of
transgression; and it cast down truth to the ground, and it did as it
pleased and prospered. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,13);</script>Then I heard a holy one speaking;
and another holy one said to that certain one who spoke, “How long shall
be the vision concerning the continual burnt offering, and the
transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the multitude
to be trodden under foot?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,14);</script>He said to me, “To two thousand
and three hundred evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary shall be
cleansed.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,15);</script>It happened
when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, that I sought to understand
it; and behold, there stood before me the appearance of a man. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,16);</script>I heard a man’s voice between
the banks of the Ulai, which called and said, “Gabriel, give this man an
understanding of the vision.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,17);</script>So he came near where I stood;
and when he came, I was frightened and fell on my face; but he said to me,
“Understand, son of man; for the vision belongs to the time of the
end.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,18);</script>Now as he was
speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground;
but he touched me and set me upright.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,19);</script>He said, “Behold, I
will give you knowledge of what shall be in the latter time of the
indignation; for it belongs to the appointed time of the end. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,20);</script>The ram, which you saw, had two
horns; they are the kings of Media and Persia. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,21);</script>The rough male goat is the
kingship of Greece; and the great horn which is between his eyes is the
first king. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,22);</script>As for that
which was broken, in the place where four stood up, four kingdoms shall
rise up out of the nation, but not with his power. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,23);</script>In the latter time of their
kingdom, when the transgressors have reached their fullness, a king of
fierce countenance, and understanding dark judgments, shall rise up.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,24);</script>His power shall be
mighty, but not by his own power; and he shall destroy astonishingly and
shall prosper and do his pleasure; and he shall destroy the mighty ones
and the holy people. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,25);</script>Through his tactics, he shall
cause craftiness to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in
his heart, and in their security he shall destroy many; he shall also rise
up against the prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,26);</script>The vision of the
evenings and mornings which has been told is true; but seal up the vision;
for it belongs to many days to come.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,27);</script>I, Daniel, fainted and
was sick for some days; then I rose up and did the king’s business; and
I wondered at the vision, but none understood it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,1);</script>In the first year of
Darius the son of Ahasuerus, offspring of the Medes, who was made king
over the realm of the Chaldeans, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,2);</script>in the first year of his reign, I,
Daniel, understood from the books the number of the years about which the
word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah the prophet, to accomplish the desolations
of Jerusalem, even seventy years. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,3);</script>I set my face towards the Lord
God, to seek by prayer and petitions, with fasting and sackcloth and ashes.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,4);</script>I prayed to Yahweh my
God, and made confession and said, “Oh, Lord, the great and dreadful
God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness with those who love him and
keep his commandments, <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,5);</script>we
have sinned and have dealt perversely and have done wickedly and have
rebelled, even turning aside from your precepts and from your ordinances;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,6);</script>neither have we listened
to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our
princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,7);</script>Lord, righteousness belongs to
you, but confusion of face to us, and on this day, to the men of Judah and
to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to all Israel, who are near and who
are far off, through all the countries where you have driven them, because
of their trespass that they have trespassed against you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,8);</script>Lord, confusion of face belongs to
us, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have
sinned against you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,9);</script>To the
Lord our God belong mercies and forgiveness, for we have rebelled against
him; <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,10);</script>neither have we
obeyed the voice of Yahweh our God to walk in his laws, which he set
before us by his servants the prophets. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,11);</script>Yes, all Israel have transgressed
your law, even turning aside so that they would not obey your voice:
therefore has the curse been poured out on us and the oath that is written
in the law of Moses the servant of God; for we have sinned against him.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,12);</script>He has confirmed his
words, which he spoke against us and against our judges who judged us, by
bringing on us a great evil; for under the whole sky has not been done as
has been done upon Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,13);</script>As it is written in the law of
Moses, so all this evil has come upon us; yet have we not entreated the
favor of Yahweh our God, so that we would turn from our iniquities and
have discernment in your truth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,14);</script>Therefore Yahweh has watched over
the evil and brought it on us; for Yahweh our God is righteous in all his
works which he does and we have not obeyed his voice. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,15);</script>Now, Lord our God, who brought
your people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and made
yourself renowned as on this day, we have sinned, we have done wickedly.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,16);</script>Lord, according to all
your righteousness, let your anger and please let your wrath be turned
away from your city Jerusalem, your holy mountain; because, for our sins
and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and your people have
become a reproach to all who are around us. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,17);</script>Now therefore, our God, listen to
the prayer of your servant and to his petitions and cause your face to
shine on your sanctuary which is desolate, for the Lord’s sake. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,18);</script>My God, turn your ear and hear;
open your eyes and see our desolations and the city which is called by
your name; for we do not present our petitions before you for our
righteousness, but for your great mercies’ sake. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,19);</script>Lord, hear; Lord, forgive; Lord,
listen and do; don’t defer, for your own sake, my God, because your city
and your people are called by your name.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,20);</script>While I was speaking
and praying and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and
presenting my supplication before Yahweh my God for the holy mountain of
my God, <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,21);</script>yes, while I was
speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the
beginning, who was made to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the
evening offering.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,22);</script>He instructed me and
talked with me and said, “Daniel, I have now come forth to give you
wisdom and understanding. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,23);</script>At the beginning of your
petitions, the commandment went forth and I have come to tell you; for you
are greatly beloved; therefore consider the matter and understand the
vision. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,24);</script>Seventy weeks of
years are decreed on your people and on your holy city, to finish
disobedience and to make an end of sins and to make reconciliation for
iniquity and to bring in everlasting righteousness and to seal up vision
and prophecy and to anoint the most holy. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,25);</script>Know therefore and discern that
from the going forth of the commandment to restore and build Jerusalem, to
the arrival of the anointed one, the prince, shall be seven weeks, and
also sixty-two weeks; and so it shall be built again, with street and
moat, even in troubled times. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,26);</script>After the sixty-two weeks, the
anointed one shall be cut off and shall have nothing; and the people of
the prince who shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and
its end shall be with a flood, and even to the end shall be war;
desolations are determined. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,27);</script>He shall make a firm covenant
with many for one week; and in the midst of the week he shall cause the
sacrifice and the offering to cease; and on the wing of abominations shall
come one who makes desolate; and even to the full end, what is determined
shall be poured out on the desolate.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,1);</script>In the third year of
Cyrus king of Persia, something was revealed to Daniel, whose name was
Belteshazzar; and the thing was true, even a great warfare; and he
understood the thing and had understanding of the vision. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,2);</script>In those days I, Daniel, was
mourning three whole weeks. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,3);</script>I ate no pleasant bread, neither
came meat nor wine into my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all,
until three whole weeks were fulfilled. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,4);</script>In the twentieth-fourth day of
the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is
Hiddekel, <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,5);</script>I lifted up my
eyes and looked, and behold, a man clothed in linen, whose thighs were
adorned with pure gold of Uphaz; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,6);</script>his body also was like beryl, and
his face like the appearance of lightning and his eyes like flaming
torches, and his arms and his feet like burnished brass, and the voice of
his words like the voice of a multitude. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,7);</script>I, Daniel, alone saw the vision;
for the men who were with me didn’t see the vision; but a great quaking
fell on them and they fled to hide themselves. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,8);</script>So, I was left alone and saw this
great vision and there remained no strength in me; for my wholesomeness
was turned in me into corruption and I retained no strength. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,9);</script>Yet I heard the voice of his
words; and when I heard the voice of his words, I then fell into a deep
sleep on my face, with my face toward the ground. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,10);</script>Behold, a hand touched me, which
set me on my knees and on the palms of my hands. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,11);</script>He said to me, “Daniel, you
man greatly beloved, understand the words which I speak to you and stand
upright; for to you am I now sent.” When he had spoken this word to me,
I stood trembling. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,12);</script>Then
he said to me, “Don’t be afraid, Daniel; for from the first day that
you set your heart to understand and to humble yourself before your God,
your words were heard; and I have come for your words’ sake. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,13);</script>But the prince of the kingdom of
Persia withstood me twenty-one days; but, behold, Michael, one of the
chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of
Persia. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,14);</script>Now I have come
to make you understand what shall happen to your people in the latter
days; for the vision is for yet many days.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,15);</script>And when he had spoken to me
according to these words, I set my face toward the ground and was mute.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(10,16);</script>Behold, one in the
likeness of the sons of men touched my lips; then I opened my mouth and
spoke and said to him who stood before me, “My lord, by reason of the
vision, my sorrows are turned on me and I retain no strength. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,17);</script>For how can the servant of you
my lord, talk with you my lord? For, as for me, immediately there remained
no strength in me, neither was there breath left in me.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,18);</script>Then there touched me again one
like the appearance of a man and he strengthened me. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,19);</script>He said, “Greatly beloved man,
don’t be afraid. Peace be to you, be strong, yes, be strong.” When he
spoke to me, I was strengthened and said, “Let my lord speak; for you
have strengthened me.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,20);</script>Then he said, “Do you know why
I have come to you? Now I will return to fight with the prince of Persia.
When I go forth, behold, the prince of Greece shall come. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,21);</script>But I will tell you that which
is inscribed in the writing of truth; and there is none who holds with me
against these, but Michael your prince.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,1);</script>“As for me, in the first year
of Darius the Mede, I rose up to confirm and strengthen him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,2);</script>Now I will show you the truth.
Behold, there shall rise up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth
shall be far richer than them all; and when he has grown strong through
his riches, he shall stir up all against the realm of Greece. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,3);</script>A mighty king shall rise up, who
shall rule with great dominion and do according to his will. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,4);</script>When he shall rise up, his
kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of the
sky, but not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion with which he
ruled; for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others besides these.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,5);</script>“The king of the
south shall be strong, and one of his princes; and he shall be strong
above him and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,6);</script>At the end of years, they
shall join themselves together; and the daughter of the king of the south
shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement; but she shall
not retain the strength of her arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm;
but she shall be given up, and those who brought her, and he who became
the father of her, and he who strengthened her in those times.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,7);</script>“But out of a shoot
from her roots shall rise up one in his place, who shall come to the army,
and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal
against them and shall prevail. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,8);</script>Also their gods, with their
molten images and with their goodly vessels of silver and of gold, he
shall carry captive into Egypt; and he shall refrain some years from the
king of the north. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,9);</script>He
shall come into the realm of the king of the south, but he shall return
into his own land. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,10);</script>His
sons shall war and shall assemble a multitude of great forces, which shall
advance and overflow and pass through; and they shall return and war, even
to his fortress. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,11);</script>The
king of the south shall be moved with anger and shall come forth and fight
with him, even with the king of the north; and he shall set forth a great
multitude, and the multitude shall be given into his hand. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,12);</script>The multitude shall be lifted
up, and his heart shall be exalted; and he shall cast down tens of
thousands, but he shall not prevail. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,13);</script>The king of the north shall
return and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former; and he
shall advance at the end of the times, even of years, with a great army
and with much wealth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,14);</script>“In those times,
many shall rise up against the king of the south; also the children of the
violent among your people shall lift themselves up to establish the
vision; but they shall fall. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,15);</script>So the king of the north shall
come and cast up a mound and take a well-fortified city; and the forces of
the south shall not stand, neither his chosen people, neither shall there
be any strength to stand. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,16);</script>But he who comes against him
shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him; and
he shall stand in the glorious land and in his hand shall be destruction.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,17);</script>He shall set his face to
come with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him;
thus shall he do; and he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting
her; but she shall not stand, nor be for him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,18);</script>“After this he
shall turn his face to the islands and shall take many; but a prince shall
cause the reproach offered by him to cease; yes, moreover, he shall cause
his reproach to turn on him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,19);</script>Then he shall turn his face
toward the fortresses of his own land; but he shall stumble and fall and
shall not be found. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,20);</script>Then
one shall rise up in his place who will cause a tax collector to pass
through the kingdom to maintain its glory; but within a few days he shall
be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,21);</script>“In his place shall
rise up a contemptible person, to whom they had not given the honor of the
kingdom; but he shall arrive in a time of security and shall obtain the
kingdom by flatteries. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,22);</script>The overwhelming forces shall be
overwhelmed from before him and shall be broken; yes, also the prince of
the covenant. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,23);</script>After the
treaty made with him, he shall work deceitfully; for he shall rise up and
shall become strong with a small people. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,24);</script>In a time of security, he shall
advance even on the richest places of the province; and he shall do what
his fathers have not done, nor his fathers’ fathers; he shall scatter
among them prey and spoil and wealth; yes, he shall devise his schemes
against the strongholds, even for a time.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,25);</script>“He shall stir up
his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army;
and the king of the south shall war in battle with an exceeding great and
mighty army; but he shall not stand, for they shall devise schemes against
him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,26);</script>Yes, those who eat
of his delicacies shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow; and many
shall fall down slain. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,27);</script>As for both these kings, their
hearts shall be set to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one
table; but it shall not succeed; for the end shall yet be at the time
appointed. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,28);</script>Then he shall
return into his land with great wealth; and his heart shall be against the
holy covenant; and he shall do as he pleases and return to his own land.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,29);</script>“At the time
appointed, he shall return and advance into the south; but it shall not be
in the latter time as it was in the former. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,30);</script>For ships of Kittim shall come
against him; therefore he shall be grieved, and shall return and have
indignation against the holy covenant, and shall do as he pleases; he
shall even return and give support to those who forsake the holy covenant.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,31);</script>Forces shall rise on his
behalf, and they shall profane the sanctuary, even the fortress, and shall
take away the continual burnt offering, and they shall set up the
abomination which makes desolate. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,32);</script>Those who do wickedly against
the covenant, he shall pervert by flatteries; but the people who know
their God shall be strong and do exploits. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,33);</script>Those who are wise among the
people shall instruct many; yet they shall fall by the sword and by flame,
by captivity and by spoil, for many days. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,34);</script>Now when they shall fall, they
shall be helped with a little help; but many shall join themselves to them
with flatteries. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,35);</script>Some of
those who are wise shall fall, to refine them, and to purify and to make
them white, even to the time of the end; because it is yet for the time
appointed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,36);</script>“The king shall do
according to his will; and he shall exalt himself and magnify himself
above every god, and shall speak astonishing things against the God of
gods; and he shall prosper until the indignation be completed; for that
which is determined shall be done. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,37);</script>Neither shall he regard the gods
of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god; for he shall
magnify himself above all. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,38);</script>But in his place, he shall honor
the god of fortresses; and a god whom his fathers didn’t know he shall
honor with gold and silver and with precious stones and pleasant things.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,39);</script>He shall deal with the
strongest fortresses by the help of a foreign god; whoever acknowledges
him he will increase with glory; and he shall cause them to rule over many
and shall divide the land for a price.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,40);</script>“At the time of the
end, the king of the south shall contend with him; and the king of the
north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots and with
horsemen and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and
shall overflow and pass through. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,41);</script>He shall enter also into the
glorious land, and many countries shall be overthrown; but these shall be
delivered out of his hand: Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children
of Ammon. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,42);</script>He shall
stretch forth his hand also on the countries; and the land of Egypt shall
not escape. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,43);</script>But he shall
have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the
precious things of Egypt; and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at
his steps. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,44);</script>But news out
of the east and out of the north shall trouble him; and he shall go forth
with great fury to destroy and utterly to sweep away many. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,45);</script>He shall plant the tents of his
palace between the sea and the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come
to his end and none shall help him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,1);</script>“At that time
Michael shall rise up, the great prince who stands for the children of
your people; and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since
there was a nation even to that same time; and at that time your people
shall be delivered, everyone who shall be found written in the book.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(12,2);</script>Many of those who sleep
in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life and some to
shame and everlasting contempt. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,3);</script>Those who are wise shall shine as
the brightness of the heavens; and those who turn many to righteousness as
the stars forever and ever. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,4);</script>But you, Daniel, shut up the
words and seal the book, even to the time of the end; many shall run back
and forth, and knowledge shall be increased.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,5);</script>Then I, Daniel, looked
and behold, there stood another two, the one on the brink of the river on
this side, and the other on the brink of the river on that side. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,6);</script>One said to the man clothed in
linen, who was above the waters of the river, “How long shall it be to
the end of these wonders?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,7);</script>I heard the man clothed in linen,
who was above the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and
his left hand to heaven and swore by him who lives forever, say that it
shall be for a time, times, and a half; and when they have made an end of
breaking in pieces the power of the holy people, all these things shall be
finished. <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,8);</script>I heard, but I
didn’t understand; then I said, “My lord, what shall be the result of
these things?” <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,9);</script>He said,
“Go your way, Daniel; for the words are shut up and sealed until the
time of the end. <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,10);</script>Many
shall purify themselves and make themselves white and be refined; but the
wicked shall do wickedly; and none of the wicked shall understand; but
those who are wise shall understand. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,11);</script>From the time that the continual
burnt offering shall be taken away, and the abomination that makes
desolate set up, there shall be one thousand two hundred ninety days.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(12,12);</script>Blessed is he who waits
and comes to the one thousand three hundred thirty-five days. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,13);</script>But you, go your way until the
end; for you shall rest and shall stand in your allotted place at the end
of days.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,1);</script>There dwelt a man in
Babylon, called Joakim. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,2);</script>And he took a wife, whose name
was Susanna, the daughter of Hilkiah, a very fair woman and one who feared
the Lord. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,3);</script>Her parents
also were righteous and taught their daughter according to the law of
Moses. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,4);</script>Now Joakim was a
great rich man and had a beautiful garden next to his house; and the Jews
turned to him for help, because he was more honorable than all others.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,5);</script>The same year, two of
the elders of the people were appointed to be judges, such ones as the
Lord spoke of, “Wickedness came from Babylon, from ancient judges, who
seemed to govern the people.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,6);</script>These spent much time at
Joakim’s house, and all those who had any lawsuits came to them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,7);</script>Now when the people departed away
at noon, Susanna went into her husband’s garden to walk. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,8);</script>And the two elders saw her going
in every day and walking, so that their lust was inflamed toward her.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,9);</script>And they perverted their
own mind and turned away their eyes, so that they would not look to
heaven, nor remember just judgments. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,10);</script>And although they both were
wounded with her love, yet each dared not show the other his grief.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,11);</script>For they were ashamed to
declare their lust, that they desired to have to do with her. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,12);</script>Yet they watched diligently from
day to day to see her. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,13);</script>And the one said to the other,
“Let us go home now, for it is dinner time.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,14);</script>So when they had gone out, they
each parted from the other, and turning back again they came to the same
place; and after they had asked each another the reason, they acknowledged
their lust, then they both appointed themselves a time when they might
find her alone.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,15);</script>And it happened, as
they watched for a fitting time, that she went in as before with two maids
only, and she intended to wash herself in the garden, for it was hot.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,16);</script>And there was no one
there except the two elders, who had hidden themselves and watched her.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,17);</script>Then she said to her
maids, “Bring me oil and washing balls and shut the garden doors, so
that I may wash myself.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,18);</script>And they did as she asked them,
and shut the garden doors, and went out themselves through private doors
to fetch the things that she had commanded them; but they didn’t see the
elders, because they were hidden. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,19);</script>Now when the maids were gone,
the two elders rose up and ran to her, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,20);</script>“Behold, the garden doors are
shut, so that no man can see us, and we are in love with you; therefore
consent to us and lie with us. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,21);</script>If you will not, we will bear
witness against you that a young man was with you, and therefore you sent
your maids away from you.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,22);</script>Then Susanna sighed and said,
“I am hemmed in on every side; for if I do this thing, it is death to
me; and if I do not do it, I cannot escape your hands. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,23);</script>It is better for me to fall into
your hands and not do it, than to sin in the sight of the Lord.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,24);</script>With that, Susanna cried with a
loud voice, and the two elders cried out against her. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,25);</script>Then the one ran and opened the
garden door. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,26);</script>So when the
servants of the house heard the cry in the garden, they rushed in through
the private door to see what had happened to her. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,27);</script>But, when the elders had
declared their story, the servants were greatly ashamed, for there was
never such a report made of Susanna.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,28);</script>And it came to pass
the next day, when the people were assembled before her husband Joakim,
that the two elders also came, full of mischievous imagination against
Susanna to put her to death; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,29);</script>And they said before the people,
“Send for Susanna, the daughter of Hilkiah, Joakim’s wife.” And so
they sent for her. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,30);</script>So
she came with her father and mother, her children, and all her kindred.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,31);</script>Now, Susanna was a very
delicate woman and beautiful to behold. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,32);</script>And these wicked men commanded
her to uncover her face, (for she was covered,) that they might be filled
with her beauty. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,33);</script>Therefore her friends and all
that saw her wept. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,34);</script>Then
the two elders stood up in the midst of the people and laid their hands
upon her head. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,35);</script>And she
looked up toward heaven weeping, for her heart trusted in the Lord.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,36);</script>And the elders said,
“As we walked in the garden alone, this woman came in with two maids and
shut the garden doors and sent the maids away. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,37);</script>Then a young man, who was hidden
there, came to her and lay with her. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,38);</script>Then, standing in a corner of
the garden, we saw this wickedness and ran towards them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,39);</script>And when we saw them together,
the man we could not hold, for he was stronger than us, and he opened the
door and leaped out. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,40);</script>But
having taken this woman, we asked her who the young man was, but she would
not tell us; to these things we testify.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,41);</script>Then the assembly believed them
because they were the elders and judges of the people; so they condemned
her to death.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,42);</script>Then Susanna cried
out with a loud voice and said, “O everlasting God, who knows the
secrets and knows all things before they be: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,43);</script>You know that they have borne
false witness against me, and behold I must die; though I never did such
things as these men have maliciously invented against me.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,44);</script>And the Lord heard her voice.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,45);</script>Therefore when she was
led to be put to death, the Lord raised up the holy spirit of a young
youth whose name was Daniel, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,46);</script>who cried with a loud voice,
“I am free of the blood of this woman.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,47);</script>Then all the people turned
toward him and said, “What do these words you have spoken mean?”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,48);</script>So, standing in their
midst, he said, “Are you such fools, you sons of Israel, that you have
condemned a daughter of Israel without examination or knowledge of the
truth? <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,49);</script>Return again to
the place of judgment, for they have borne false witness against her.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,50);</script>Therefore all the
people returned again in haste, and the elders said to him, “Come, sit
down among us and teach us, since that God has given you the honor of an
elder.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,51);</script>Then Daniel
said to them, “Put these two aside, one far from another, and I will
examine them.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,52);</script>So,
when they were put apart one from another, he called one of them and said
to him, “O you who has grown old in wickedness, now your sins, which you
have committed before this time, have come to light. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,53);</script>For you have pronounced false
judgment and have condemned the innocent and have let the guilty go free;
even though the Lord says, ‘The innocent and righteous you shall not
slay.’ <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,54);</script>Now then, if
you saw her, tell me, under what tree did you see them consorting
together?” He answered, “Under a mastick tree.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,55);</script>And Daniel said, “Very well;
you have lied against your own head; for even now the angel of God has
received the sentence of God to cut you in two.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,56);</script>So he put him aside and
commanded them to bring the other, and he said to him, “O you, offspring
of Canaan and not of Judah, beauty has deceived you and lust has perverted
your heart. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,57);</script>Thus have
you dealt with the daughters of Israel, and they out of fear consorted
with you; but the daughter of Judah would not tolerate your wickedness.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,58);</script>Now therefore, tell me,
under what tree did you find them consorting together?” He answered,
“Under an holm tree.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,59);</script>Then Daniel said to him,
“Well, you also have lied against your own head; for the angel of God
waits with the sword to cut you in two, that he may destroy you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,60);</script>With that all the
assembly cried out with a loud voice and praised God, who saves those who
trust in him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,61);</script>And they
arose against the two elders, for Daniel had convicted them of false
witness by their own mouth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,62);</script>And, according to the law of
Moses, they did to them in the same way as they maliciously intended to do
to their neighbor; and they put them to death. Thus, innocent blood was
saved that same day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,63);</script>Therefore Hilkiah and his wife
praised God for their daughter Susanna, with Joakim her husband and all
their kindred, because there was no dishonesty found in her. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,64);</script>From that day forth, Daniel had
a great reputation in the sight of the people.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,1);</script>And king Astyages was
gathered to his fathers, and Cyrus of Persia received his kingdom. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,2);</script>And Daniel conversed with the
king and was honored above all his friends. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,3);</script>Now the Babylons had an idol,
called Bel, and every day twelve great measures of fine flour and forty
sheep and six vessels of wine were spent upon him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,4);</script>And the king worshipped it and
went daily to adore it; but Daniel worshipped his own God. And the king
said to him, “Why do you not worship Bel?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,5);</script>He answered and said, “Because
I may not worship idols made with hands, but only the living God, who has
created the heaven and the earth and has sovereignty over all flesh.”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(14,6);</script>Then the king said to
him, “Do you not think that Bel is a living God? Do you not see how much
he eats and drinks every day?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,7);</script>Then Daniel smiled and said, “O
king, be not deceived; for this is only clay within and brass without, and
never ate or drank anything.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,8);</script>So the king was angry and called
for his priests, and said to them, “If you do not tell me who it is that
devours these expenses, you shall die! <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,9);</script>But, if you can prove to me that
Bel devours them, then Daniel shall die, for he has spoken blasphemy
against Bel.” And Daniel said to the king, “Let it be according to
your word.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,10);</script>Now the priests of
Bel were seventy, besides their wives and children. And the king went with
Daniel into the temple of Bel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,11);</script>So Bel’s priests said, “Lo,
we go out; but you, O king, set out the meat and prepare the wine, and
shut the door fast and seal it with your own signet; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,12);</script>And tomorrow when you come in,
if you do not find that Bel has eaten all, we will suffer death, or else
Daniel, who speaks falsely against us.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,13);</script>And they had little concern
about it because under the table they had made a private entrance, whereby
they entered in continually and consumed those things. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,14);</script>So when they had gone, the king
set out the meats before Bel. Now Daniel had commanded his servants to
bring ashes, and those they strewed throughout the entire temple in the
presence of the king alone; then they went out and shut the door, and
sealed it with the king’s signet, and so departed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,15);</script>Now in the night the priests
with their wives and children came, as they were accustomed to do, and
they ate and drank it all.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,16);</script>In the early morning
the king arose, and Daniel with him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,17);</script>And the king said, “Daniel,
are the seals whole?” And he said, “Yes, O king, they are whole.”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(14,18);</script>And as soon as he had
opened the door, the king looked upon the table and cried with a loud
voice, “Great you are, O Bel, and with you is no deceit at all!”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(14,19);</script>Then Daniel laughed, and
held the king back so that he would not go in, and he said, “Behold now
the pavement, and mark well whose footsteps these are.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,20);</script>And the king said, “I see the
footsteps of men, women, and children.” And then the king was angry,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(14,21);</script>and he took the priests
with their wives and children, who showed him the private doors where they
came in and consumed such things as were on the table. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,22);</script>Therefore the king slew them,
and delivered Bel into Daniel’s power, who destroyed him and his temple.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,23);</script>And in that same
place there was a great dragon, which they of Babylon worshipped. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,24);</script>And the king said to Daniel,
“Will you also say that this is of brass? Lo, he lives, he eats and
drinks; you cannot say that he is no living god; therefore, worship
him.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,25);</script>Then Daniel said
to the king, “I will worship the Lord my God; for he is the living God.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(14,26);</script>But give me permission,
O king, and I shall slay this dragon without sword or staff.” The king
said, “I give you permission.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,27);</script>Then Daniel took pitch and fat
and hair, and boiled them together, and made lumps thereof; this he put in
the dragon’s mouth, and so the dragon burst apart; and Daniel said,
“Lo, these are the gods you worship.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,28);</script>When they of Babylon
heard this, they took great indignation and conspired against the king,
saying, “The king has become a Jew and he has destroyed Bel; he has
slain the dragon and put the priests to death.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,29);</script>So they came to the king and
said, “Deliver Daniel to us or else we will destroy you and your
house.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,30);</script>Now when the
king saw that they pressed him severely, being constrained, he delivered
Daniel to them; <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,31);</script>they
cast him into the lions’ den, where he was for six days. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,32);</script>And in the den there were seven
lions, and they had given them every day two carcasses and two sheep,
which then were not given to them, to the intent that they might devour
Daniel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,33);</script>Now there was among
the Jews a prophet, called Habbakuk, who had made pottage and had broken
bread in a bowl, and was going into the field, to bring it to the reapers.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(14,34);</script>But the angel of the
Lord said to Habbakuk, “Go, carry the dinner that you have into Babylon
to Daniel, who is in the lions’ den.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,35);</script>And Habbakuk said, “Lord, I
never saw Babylon; neither do I know where the den is.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,36);</script>Then the angel of the Lord took
him by the crown, and carried him by the hair of his head, and through the
vehemence of his spirit set him in Babylon over the den. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,37);</script>And Habbakuk cried, saying, “O
Daniel, Daniel, take the dinner which God has sent you.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,38);</script>And Daniel said, “You have
remembered me, O God; neither have you forsaken those who seek you and
love you.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,39);</script>So Daniel
arose and ate; and the angel of the Lord set Habbakuk in his own place
again immediately.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,40);</script>Upon the seventh day
the king went to bewail Daniel; and when he came to the den, he looked in,
and behold, Daniel was sitting. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,41);</script>Then the king cried with a loud
voice, saying, “Great are you, Lord God of Daniel, and there is no other
beside you!” <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,42);</script>And he
drew him out, and cast those who were the cause of his destruction into
the den; and they were devoured in a moment before his face.

The Greek Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate number chapter 4, verses 1-3 as
