Deuteronomy
</h1><p>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,1);</script>These are the words which
Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan in the wilderness, in the
Arabah over against Suph, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and
Hazeroth, and Dizahab. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,2);</script>It
is eleven days’ journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to Kadesh
Barnea. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,3);</script>It happened in the
fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that
Moses spoke to the children of Israel, according to all that <a
href="#N1">Yahweh</a> had given him in commandment to them; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,4);</script>after he had struck Sihon the king
of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who
lived in Ashtaroth, at Edrei. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,5);</script>Beyond the Jordan, in the land of
Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,6);</script>“Yahweh our <a
href="#N2">God</a> spoke to us in Horeb, saying, You have lived long
enough in this mountain: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,7);</script>turn, and take your journey, and
go to the hill country of the Amorites, and to all the places near there,
in the Arabah, in the hill country, and in the lowland, and in the South,
and by the seashore, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as
the great river, the river Euphrates. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,8);</script>Behold, I have set the land before
you: go in and possess the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers, to
Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give to them and to their seed after
them.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,9);</script>I spoke to you at that
time, saying, “I am not able to bear you myself alone: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,10);</script>Yahweh your God has multiplied
you, and behold, you are this day as the stars of the sky for multitude.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,11);</script>Yahweh, the God of your
fathers, make you a thousand times as many as you are, and bless you, as
he has promised you! <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,12);</script>How
can I myself alone bear your encumbrance, and your burden, and your
strife? <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,13);</script>Take wise men of
understanding and well known according to your tribes, and I will make
them heads over you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,14);</script>You answered me, and
said, “The thing which you have spoken is good to do.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,15);</script>So I took the heads of your
tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains of
thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains
of tens, and officers, according to your tribes. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,16);</script>I commanded your judges at that
time, saying, “Hear cases between your brothers, and judge righteously
between a man and his brother, and the foreigner who is living with him.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,17);</script>You shall not show
partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small and the great alike; you
shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God’s. The
case that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear
it.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,18);</script>I commanded you at
that time all the things which you should do. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,19);</script>We traveled from Horeb, and went
through all that great and terrible wilderness which you saw, by the way
to the hill country of the Amorites, as Yahweh our God commanded us; and
we came to Kadesh Barnea. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,20);</script>I said to you, “You have come
to the hill country of the Amorites, which Yahweh our God gives to us.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,21);</script>Behold, Yahweh your God
has set the land before you: go up, take possession, as Yahweh, the God of
your fathers, has spoken to you; don’t be afraid, neither be dismayed.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,22);</script>You came near to me
everyone of you, and said, “Let us send men before us, that they may
search the land for us, and bring us word again of the way by which we
must go up, and the cities to which we shall come.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,23);</script>The thing pleased me
well; and I took twelve men of you, one man for every tribe: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,24);</script>and they turned and went up into
the hill country, and came to the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,25);</script>They took of the fruit of
the land in their hands, and brought it down to us, and brought us word
again, and said, “It is a good land which Yahweh our God gives to us.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,26);</script>Yet you wouldn’t go
up, but rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh your God: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,27);</script>and you murmured in your tents,
and said, “Because Yahweh hated us, he has brought us forth out of the
land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,28);</script>Where are we going up?
our brothers have made our heart to melt, saying, ‘The people are
greater and taller than we; the cities are great and fortified up to the
sky; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,29);</script>Then I said to you,
“Don’t dread, neither be afraid of them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,30);</script>Yahweh your God who goes before
you, he will fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt
before your eyes, <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,31);</script>and in
the wilderness, where you have seen how that Yahweh your God bore you, as
a man does bear his son, in all the way that you went, until you came to
this place.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,32);</script>Yet in this thing you
didn’t believe Yahweh your God, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,33);</script>who went before you in the way,
to seek you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to show
you by what way you should go, and in the cloud by day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,34);</script>Yahweh heard the voice of your
words, and was angry, and swore, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,35);</script>“Surely not one of these men of
this evil generation shall see the good land, which I swore to give to
your fathers, <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,36);</script>except
Caleb the son of Jephunneh: he shall see it; and to him will I give the
land that he has trodden on, and to his children, because he has wholly
followed Yahweh.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,37);</script>Also Yahweh was angry
with me for your sakes, saying, “You also shall not go in there: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,38);</script>Joshua the son of Nun, who stands
before you, he shall go in there: encourage you him; for he shall cause
Israel to inherit it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,39);</script>Moreover your little ones, whom
you said should be a prey, and your children, who this day have no
knowledge of good or evil, they shall go in there, and to them will I give
it, and they shall possess it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,40);</script>But as for you, turn, and take
your journey into the wilderness by the way to the <a href="#N3">Red
Sea</a>.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,41);</script>Then you answered and
said to me, “We have sinned against Yahweh, we will go up and fight,
according to all that Yahweh our God commanded us.” Every man of you put
on his weapons of war, and presumed to go up into the hill country.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,42);</script>Yahweh said to me,
“Tell them, ‘Don’t go up, neither fight; for I am not among you;
lest you be struck before your enemies.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,43);</script>So I spoke to you, and
you didn’t listen; but you rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh,
and were presumptuous, and went up into the hill country. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,44);</script>The Amorites, who lived in that
hill country, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and beat
you down in Seir, even to Hormah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,45);</script>You returned and wept before
Yahweh; but Yahweh didn’t listen to your voice, nor gave ear to you.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,46);</script>So you stayed in Kadesh
many days, according to the days that you remained.
<p> <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,1);</script>Then we turned, and
took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the <a href="#N4">Red
Sea</a>, as Yahweh spoke to me; and we encircled Mount Seir many days.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,2);</script>Yahweh spoke to me,
saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,3);</script>“You have
encircled this mountain long enough. Turn northward. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,4);</script>Command the people, saying, ‘You
are to pass through the border of your brothers the children of Esau, who
dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you: take good heed to
yourselves therefore; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,5);</script>don’t contend with them; for I
will not give you of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the
foot to tread on; because I have given Mount Seir to Esau for a
possession. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,6);</script>You shall
purchase food of them for money, that you may eat; and you shall also buy
water of them for money, that you may drink.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,7);</script>For Yahweh your God has
blessed you in all the work of your hand; he has known your walking
through this great wilderness: these forty years Yahweh your God has been
with you; you have lacked nothing.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,8);</script>So we passed by from
our brothers the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir, from the way of the
Arabah from Elath and from Ezion Geber. We turned and passed by the way of
the wilderness of Moab.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,9);</script>Yahweh said to me,
“Don’t bother Moab, neither contend with them in battle; for I will
not give you of his land for a possession; because I have given Ar to the
children of Lot for a possession.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,10);</script>(The Emim lived
therein before, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,11);</script>these also are accounted Rephaim,
as the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,12);</script>The Horites also lived in Seir
before, but the children of Esau succeeded them; and they destroyed them
from before them, and lived in their place; as Israel did to the land of
his possession, which Yahweh gave to them.)
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,13);</script>“Now rise up, and
cross over the brook Zered.” We went over the brook Zered. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,14);</script>The days in which we came from
Kadesh Barnea, until we had come over the brook Zered, were thirty-eight
years; until all the generation of the men of war were consumed from the
midst of the camp, as Yahweh swore to them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,15);</script>Moreover the hand of Yahweh was
against them, to destroy them from the midst of the camp, until they were
consumed. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,16);</script>So it happened,
when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,17);</script>that Yahweh spoke to me,
saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,18);</script>“You are this
day to pass over Ar, the border of Moab: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,19);</script>and when you come near over
against the children of Ammon, don’t bother them, nor contend with them;
for I will not give you of the land of the children of Ammon for a
possession; because I have given it to the children of Lot for a
possession.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,20);</script>(That also is
accounted a land of Rephaim: Rephaim lived therein before; but the
Ammonites call them Zamzummim, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,21);</script>a people great, and many, and
tall, as the Anakim; but Yahweh destroyed them before them; and they
succeeded them, and lived in their place; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,22);</script>as he did for the children of
Esau, who dwell in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them;
and they succeeded them, and lived in their place even to this day:
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,23);</script>and the Avvim, who lived
in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim, who came forth out of Caphtor,
destroyed them, and lived in their place.)
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,24);</script>“Rise up, take your
journey, and pass over the valley of the Arnon: behold, I have given into
your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land; begin to
possess it, and contend with him in battle. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,25);</script>This day will I begin to put the
dread of you and the fear of you on the peoples who are under the whole
sky, who shall hear the report of you, and shall tremble, and be in
anguish because of you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,26);</script>I sent messengers out
of the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of
peace, saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,27);</script>“Let me
pass through your land: I will go along by the highway, I will turn
neither to the right hand nor to the left. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,28);</script>You shall sell me food for money,
that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only let me
pass through on my feet, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,29);</script>as the children of Esau who dwell
in Seir, and the Moabites who dwell in Ar, did to me; until I shall pass
over the Jordan into the land which Yahweh our God gives us.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,30);</script>But Sihon king of Heshbon would
not let us pass by him; for Yahweh your God hardened his spirit, and made
his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into your hand, as at this
day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,31);</script>Yahweh said to me,
“Behold, I have begun to deliver up Sihon and his land before you: begin
to possess, that you may inherit his land.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,32);</script>Then Sihon came out against us,
he and all his people, to battle at Jahaz. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,33);</script>Yahweh our God delivered him up
before us; and we struck him, and his sons, and all his people. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,34);</script>We took all his cities at that
time, and utterly destroyed every inhabited city, with the women and the
little ones; we left none remaining: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,35);</script>only the livestock we took for a
prey to ourselves, with the spoil of the cities which we had taken.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,36);</script>From Aroer, which is on
the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the valley,
even to Gilead, there was not a city too high for us; Yahweh our God
delivered up all before us: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,37);</script>only to the land of the children
of Ammon you didn’t come near; all the side of the river Jabbok, and the
cities of the hill country, and wherever Yahweh our God forbade us.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,1);</script>Then we turned, and
went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us,
he and all his people, to battle at Edrei. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,2);</script>Yahweh said to me, “Don’t fear
him; for I have delivered him, and all his people, and his land, into your
hand; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites,
who lived at Heshbon.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,3);</script>So Yahweh our God
delivered into our hand Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people:
and we struck him until none was left to him remaining. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,4);</script>We took all his cities at that
time; there was not a city which we didn’t take from them; sixty cities,
all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,5);</script>All these were cities fortified
with high walls, gates, and bars; besides the unwalled towns a great many.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,6);</script>We utterly destroyed them,
as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every inhabited
city, with the women and the little ones. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,7);</script>But all the livestock, and the
spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,8);</script>We took the land at that time out
of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan,
from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,9);</script>(The Sidonians call Hermon Sirion,
and the Amorites call it Senir.) <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,10);</script>We took all the cities of the
plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, to Salecah and Edrei, cities of the
kingdom of Og in Bashan. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,11);</script>(For only Og king of Bashan
remained of the remnant of the Rephaim; behold, his bedstead was a
bedstead of iron; isn’t it in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? nine
cubits was its length, and four cubits its breadth, after the cubit of a
man.) <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,12);</script>This land we took
in possession at that time: from Aroer, which is by the valley of the
Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead, and its cities, gave I to the
Reubenites and to the Gadites: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,13);</script>and the rest of Gilead, and all
Bashan, the kingdom of Og, gave I to the half-tribe of Manasseh; all the
region of Argob, even all Bashan. (The same is called the land of Rephaim.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,14);</script>Jair the son of Manasseh
took all the region of Argob, to the border of the Geshurites and the
Maacathites, and called them, even Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth
Jair, to this day.) <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,15);</script>I
gave Gilead to Machir. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,16);</script>To
the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the valley of
the Arnon, the middle of the valley, and its border, even to the river
Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,17);</script>the Arabah also, and the Jordan
and its border, from Chinnereth even to the sea of the Arabah, the Salt
Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah eastward.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,18);</script>I commanded you at
that time, saying, “Yahweh your God has given you this land to possess
it: you shall pass over armed before your brothers the children of Israel,
all the men of valor. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,19);</script>But
your wives, and your little ones, and your livestock, (I know that you
have much livestock), shall live in your cities which I have given you,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,20);</script>until Yahweh gives rest
to your brothers, as to you, and they also possess the land which Yahweh
your God gives them beyond the Jordan: then you shall return every man to
his possession, which I have given you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,21);</script>I commanded Joshua at
that time, saying, “Your eyes have seen all that Yahweh your God has
done to these two kings: so shall Yahweh do to all the kingdoms where you
go over. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,22);</script>You shall not
fear them; for Yahweh your God, he it is who fights for you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,23);</script>I begged Yahweh at
that time, saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,24);</script>“<a
href="#N5">Lord</a> Yahweh, you have begun to show your servant your
greatness, and your strong hand: for what god is there in heaven or in
earth, that can do according to your works, and according to your mighty
acts? <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,25);</script>Please let me go
over and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan, that goodly
mountain, and Lebanon.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,26);</script>But Yahweh was angry
with me for your sakes, and didn’t listen to me; and Yahweh said to me,
“Let it suffice you; speak no more to me of this matter. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,27);</script>Go up to the top of Pisgah, and
lift up your eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward,
and see with your eyes: for you shall not go over this Jordan. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,28);</script>But commission Joshua, and
encourage him, and strengthen him; for he shall go over before this
people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which you shall
see.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,29);</script>So we stayed in
the valley over against Beth Peor.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,1);</script>Now, Israel, listen to
the statutes and to the ordinances, which I teach you, to do them; that
you may live, and go in and possess the land which Yahweh, the God of your
fathers, gives you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,2);</script>You
shall not add to the word which I command you, neither shall you diminish
from it, that you may keep the commandments of Yahweh your God which I
command you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,3);</script>Your eyes
have seen what Yahweh did because of Baal Peor; for all the men who
followed Baal Peor, Yahweh your God has destroyed them from the midst of
you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,4);</script>But you who were
faithful to Yahweh your God are all alive this day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,5);</script>Behold, I have taught you statutes
and ordinances, even as Yahweh my God commanded me, that you should do so
in the midst of the land where you go in to possess it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,6);</script>Keep therefore and do them; for
this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples,
who shall hear all these statutes, and say, “Surely this great nation is
a wise and understanding people.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,7);</script>For what great nation is there,
that has a god so near to them, as Yahweh our God is whenever we call on
him? <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,8);</script>What great nation is
there, that has statutes and ordinances so righteous as all this law,
which I set before you this day?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,9);</script>Only take heed to
yourself, and keep your soul diligently, lest you forget the things which
your eyes saw, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your
life; but make them known to your children and your children’s children;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,10);</script>the day that you stood
before Yahweh your God in Horeb, when Yahweh said to me, “Assemble me
the people, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to
fear me all the days that they live on the earth, and that they may teach
their children.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,11);</script>You
came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire
to the heart of the sky, with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,12);</script>Yahweh spoke to you out of the
midst of the fire: you heard the voice of words, but you saw no form; you
only heard a voice. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,13);</script>He
declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even the
ten commandments; and he wrote them on two tables of stone. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,14);</script>Yahweh commanded me at that time
to teach you statutes and ordinances, that you might do them in the land
where you go over to possess it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,15);</script>Take therefore good heed to
yourselves; for you saw no kind of form on the day that Yahweh spoke to
you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,16);</script>Lest you corrupt yourselves, and
make yourself an engraved image in the form of any figure, the likeness of
male or female, <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,17);</script>the
likeness of any animal that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged
bird that flies in the sky, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,18);</script>the likeness of anything that
creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under
the earth; <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,19);</script>and lest you
lift up your eyes to the sky, and when you see the sun and the moon and
the stars, even all the army of the sky, you are drawn away and worship
them, and serve them, which Yahweh your God has allotted to all the
peoples under the whole sky. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,20);</script>But Yahweh has taken you, and
brought you forth out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be to him a
people of inheritance, as at this day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,21);</script>Furthermore Yahweh was angry with
me for your sakes, and swore that I should not go over the Jordan, and
that I should not go in to that good land, which Yahweh your God gives you
for an inheritance: <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,22);</script>but I
must die in this land, I must not go over the Jordan; but you shall go
over, and possess that good land. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,23);</script>Take heed to yourselves, lest you
forget the covenant of Yahweh your God, which he made with you, and make
you an engraved image in the form of anything which Yahweh your God has
forbidden you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,24);</script>For Yahweh
your God is a devouring fire, a jealous God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,25);</script>When you shall father children,
and children’s children, and you shall have been long in the land, and
shall corrupt yourselves, and make an engraved image in the form of
anything, and shall do that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh your God,
to provoke him to anger; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,26);</script>I call heaven and earth to
witness against you this day, that you shall soon utterly perish from off
the land whereunto you go over the Jordan to possess it; you shall not
prolong your days on it, but shall utterly be destroyed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,27);</script>Yahweh will scatter you among the
peoples, and you shall be left few in number among the nations, where
Yahweh shall lead you away. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,28);</script>There you shall serve gods, the
work of men’s hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor
eat, nor smell. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,29);</script>But from
there you shall seek Yahweh your God, and you shall find him, when you
search after him with all your heart and with all your soul. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,30);</script>When you are in oppression, and
all these things have come on you, in the latter days you shall return to
Yahweh your God, and listen to his voice: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,31);</script>for Yahweh your God is a merciful
God; he will not fail you, neither destroy you, nor forget the covenant of
your fathers which he swore to them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,32);</script>For ask now of the days that are
past, which were before you, since the day that God created man on the
earth, and from the one end of the sky to the other, whether there has
been anything as this great thing is, or has been heard like it? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,33);</script>Did a people ever hear the voice
of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as you have heard, and live?
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,34);</script>Or has God tried to go
and take a nation for himself from the midst of another nation, by trials,
by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by an
outstretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that Yahweh your
God did for you in Egypt before your eyes? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,35);</script>It was shown to you so that you
might know that Yahweh is God. There is no one else besides him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,36);</script>Out of heaven he made you to hear
his voice, that he might instruct you: and on earth he made you to see his
great fire; and you heard his words out of the midst of the fire. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,37);</script>Because he loved your fathers,
therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought you out with his
presence, with his great power, out of Egypt; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,38);</script>to drive out nations from before
you greater and mightier than you, to bring you in, to give you their land
for an inheritance, as at this day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,39);</script>Know therefore this day, and lay
it to your heart, that Yahweh he is God in heaven above and on the earth
beneath; there is none else. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,40);</script>You shall keep his statutes, and
his commandments, which I command you this day, that it may go well with
you, and with your children after you, and that you may prolong your days
in the land, which Yahweh your God gives you, forever. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,41);</script>Then Moses set apart three cities
beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,42);</script>that the manslayer might flee
there, who kills his neighbor unawares, and didn’t hate him in time
past; and that fleeing to one of these cities he might live: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,43);</script>Bezer in the wilderness, in the
plain country, for the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, for the Gadites;
and Golan in Bashan, for the Manassites. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,44);</script>This is the law which Moses set
before the children of Israel: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,45);</script>these are the testimonies, and
the statutes, and the ordinances, which Moses spoke to the children of
Israel, when they came forth out of Egypt, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,46);</script>beyond the Jordan, in the valley
over against Beth Peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who
lived at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel struck, when they
came forth out of Egypt. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,47);</script>They took his land in possession,
and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who were
beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,48);</script>from Aroer, which is on the edge
of the valley of the Arnon, even to Mount Sion (the same is Hermon),
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,49);</script>and all the Arabah beyond
the Jordan eastward, even to the sea of the Arabah, under the slopes of
Pisgah.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,1);</script>Moses called to all
Israel, and said to them, Hear, Israel, the statutes and the ordinances
which I speak in your ears this day, that you may learn them, and observe
to do them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,2);</script>Yahweh our God
made a covenant with us in Horeb. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,3);</script>Yahweh didn’t make this covenant
with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this
day. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,4);</script>Yahweh spoke with you
face to face on the mountain out of the midst of the fire, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,5);</script>(I stood between Yahweh and you at
that time, to show you the word of Yahweh: for you were afraid because of
the fire, and didn’t go up onto the mountain;) saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,6);</script>“I am Yahweh your God, who
brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,7);</script>“You shall have no
other gods before me.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,8);</script>“You shall not make
an engraved image for yourself, any likeness of what is in heaven above,
or what is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:
<script type="text/javascript">cb(5,9);</script>you shall not bow down
yourself to them, nor serve them; for I, Yahweh, your God, am a jealous
God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, and on the
third and on the fourth generation of those who hate me; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,10);</script>and showing loving kindness to
thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,11);</script>“You shall not take
the name of Yahweh your God in vain: for Yahweh will not hold him
guiltless who takes his name in vain.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,12);</script>“Observe the Sabbath
day, to keep it holy, as Yahweh your God commanded you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,13);</script>You shall labor six days, and do
all your work; <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,14);</script>but the
seventh day is a Sabbath to Yahweh your God, in which you shall not do any
work, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor
your female servant, nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor any of your
livestock, nor your stranger who is within your gates; that your male
servant and your female servant may rest as well as you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,15);</script>You shall remember that you were
a servant in the land of Egypt, and Yahweh your God brought you out of
there by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm: therefore Yahweh your
God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,16);</script>“Honor your father
and your mother, as Yahweh your God commanded you; that your days may be
long, and that it may go well with you, in the land which Yahweh your God
gives you.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,17);</script>“You shall not
murder.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,18);</script>“Neither shall you
commit adultery.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,19);</script>“Neither shall you
steal.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,20);</script>“Neither shall you
give false testimony against your neighbor.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,21);</script>“Neither shall you
covet your neighbor’s wife; neither shall you desire your neighbor’s
house, his field, or his male servant, or his female servant, his ox, or
his donkey, or anything that is your neighbor’s.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,22);</script>These words Yahweh
spoke to all your assembly on the mountain out of the midst of the fire,
of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added
no more. He wrote them on two tables of stone, and gave them to me.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(5,23);</script>It happened, when you
heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, while the mountain was
burning with fire, that you came near to me, even all the heads of your
tribes, and your elders; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,24);</script>and you said, “Behold, Yahweh
our God has shown us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his
voice out of the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God does
speak with man, and he lives. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,25);</script>Now therefore why should we die?
For this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of Yahweh our
God any more, then we shall die. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,26);</script>For who is there of all flesh,
that has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of
the fire, as we have, and lived? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,27);</script>Go near, and hear all that Yahweh
our God shall say: and tell us all that Yahweh our God shall tell you; and
we will hear it, and do it.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,28);</script>Yahweh heard the voice
of your words, when you spoke to me; and Yahweh said to me, “I have
heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken to
you: they have well said all that they have spoken. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,29);</script>Oh that there were such a heart
in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always,
that it might be well with them, and with their children forever!
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,30);</script>“Go tell them,
Return to your tents. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,31);</script>But
as for you, stand here by me, and I will tell you all the commandment, and
the statutes, and the ordinances, which you shall teach them, that they
may do them in the land which I give them to possess it.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,32);</script>You shall observe to
do therefore as Yahweh your God has commanded you: you shall not turn
aside to the right hand or to the left. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,33);</script>You shall walk in all the way
which Yahweh your God has commanded you, that you may live, and that it
may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days in the land which
you shall possess.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,1);</script>Now this is the
commandment, the statutes, and the ordinances, which Yahweh your God
commanded to teach you, that you might do them in the land where you go
over to possess it; <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,2);</script>that
you might fear Yahweh your God, to keep all his statutes and his
commandments, which I command you, you, and your son, and your son’s
son, all the days of your life; and that your days may be prolonged.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(6,3);</script>Hear therefore, Israel,
and observe to do it; that it may be well with you, and that you may
increase mightily, as Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has promised to
you, in a land flowing with milk and honey. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,4);</script>Hear, Israel: Yahweh is our God;
Yahweh is one: <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,5);</script>and you
shall love Yahweh your God with all your heart, and with all your soul,
and with all your might. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,6);</script>These words, which I command you
this day, shall be on your heart; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,7);</script>and you shall teach them
diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your
house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you
rise up. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,8);</script>You shall bind
them for a sign on your hand, and they shall be for symbols between your
eyes. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,9);</script>You shall write them
on the door posts of your house, and on your gates. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,10);</script>It shall be, when Yahweh your God
shall bring you into the land which he swore to your fathers, to Abraham,
to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give you, great and goodly cities, which you
didn’t build, <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,11);</script>and
houses full of all good things, which you didn’t fill, and cisterns dug
out, which you didn’t dig, vineyards and olive trees, which you didn’t
plant, and you shall eat and be full; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,12);</script>then beware lest you forget
Yahweh, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house
of bondage. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,13);</script>You shall
fear Yahweh your God; and you shall serve him, and shall swear by his
name. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,14);</script>You shall not go
after other gods, of the gods of the peoples who are around you; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,15);</script>for Yahweh your God in the midst
of you is a jealous God; lest the anger of Yahweh your God be kindled
against you, and he destroy you from off the face of the earth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,16);</script>You shall not tempt Yahweh your
God, as you tempted him in Massah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,17);</script>You shall diligently keep the
commandments of Yahweh your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes,
which he has commanded you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,18);</script>You shall do that which is right
and good in the sight of Yahweh; that it may be well with you, and that
you may go in and possess the good land which Yahweh swore to your
fathers, <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,19);</script>to thrust out
all your enemies from before you, as Yahweh has spoken.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,20);</script>When your son asks you
in time to come, saying, “What do the testimonies, the statutes, and the
ordinances, which Yahweh our God has commanded you mean?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,21);</script>then you shall tell your son,
“We were Pharaoh’s bondservants in Egypt: and Yahweh brought us out of
Egypt with a mighty hand; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,22);</script>and Yahweh showed great and
awesome signs and wonders on Egypt, on Pharaoh, and on all his house,
before our eyes; <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,23);</script>and he
brought us out from there, that he might bring us in, to give us the land
which he swore to our fathers. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,24);</script>Yahweh commanded us to do all
these statutes, to fear Yahweh our God, for our good always, that he might
preserve us alive, as at this day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,25);</script>It shall be righteousness to us,
if we observe to do all this commandment before Yahweh our God, as he has
commanded us.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,1);</script>When Yahweh your God
shall bring you into the land where you go to possess it, and shall cast
out many nations before you, the Hittite, and the Girgashite, and the
Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the
Jebusite, seven nations greater and mightier than you; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,2);</script>and when Yahweh your God shall
deliver them up before you, and you shall strike them; then you shall
utterly destroy them: you shall make no covenant with them, nor show mercy
to them; <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,3);</script>neither shall you
make marriages with them; your daughter you shall not give to his son, nor
shall you take his daughter for your son. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,4);</script>For he will turn away your son
from following me, that they may serve other gods: so the anger of Yahweh
would be kindled against you, and he would destroy you quickly. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,5);</script>But you shall deal with them like
this: you shall break down their altars, and dash their pillars in pieces,
and cut down their Asherim, and burn their engraved images with fire.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,6);</script>For you are a holy people
to Yahweh your God: Yahweh your God has chosen you to be a people for his
own possession, above all peoples who are on the face of the earth.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,7);</script>Yahweh didn’t set his
love on you, nor choose you, because you were more in number than any
people; for you were the fewest of all peoples: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,8);</script>but because Yahweh loves you, and
because he would keep the oath which he swore to your fathers, has Yahweh
brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of
bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,9);</script>Know therefore that Yahweh your
God, he is God, the faithful God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness
with them who love him and keep his commandments to a thousand
generations, <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,10);</script>and repays
those who hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to
him who hates him, he will repay him to his face. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,11);</script>You shall therefore keep the
commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which I command you
this day, to do them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,12);</script>It
shall happen, because you listen to these ordinances, and keep and do
them, that Yahweh your God will keep with you the covenant and the loving
kindness which he swore to your fathers: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,13);</script>and he will love you, and bless
you, and multiply you; he will also bless the fruit of your body and the
fruit of your ground, your grain and your new wine and your oil, the
increase of your livestock and the young of your flock, in the land which
he swore to your fathers to give you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,14);</script>You shall be blessed above all
peoples: there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your
livestock. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,15);</script>Yahweh will
take away from you all sickness; and none of the evil diseases of Egypt,
which you know, he will put on you, but will lay them on all those who
hate you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,16);</script>You shall
consume all the peoples whom Yahweh your God shall deliver to you; your
eye shall not pity them: neither shall you serve their gods; for that will
be a snare to you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,17);</script>If you
shall say in your heart, “These nations are more than I; how can I
dispossess them?” <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,18);</script>you
shall not be afraid of them: you shall well remember what Yahweh your God
did to Pharaoh, and to all Egypt; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,19);</script>the great trials which your eyes
saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the
outstretched arm, by which Yahweh your God brought you out: so shall
Yahweh your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,20);</script>Moreover Yahweh your God will
send the hornet among them, until those who are left, and hide themselves,
perish from before you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,21);</script>You shall not be scared of them;
for Yahweh your God is in the midst of you, a great and awesome God.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,22);</script>Yahweh your God will cast
out those nations before you by little and little: you may not consume
them at once, lest the animals of the field increase on you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,23);</script>But Yahweh your God will deliver
them up before you, and will confuse them with a great confusion, until
they be destroyed. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,24);</script>He
will deliver their kings into your hand, and you shall make their name to
perish from under the sky: no man shall be able to stand before you, until
you have destroyed them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,25);</script>You shall burn the engraved
images of their gods with fire. You shall not covet the silver or the gold
that is on them, nor take it for yourself, lest you be snared in it; for
it is an abomination to Yahweh your God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,26);</script>You shall not bring an
abomination into your house, and become a devoted thing like it. You shall
utterly detest it, and you shall utterly abhor it; for it is a devoted
thing.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,1);</script>You shall observe to do
all the commandment which I command you this day, that you may live, and
multiply, and go in and possess the land which Yahweh swore to your
fathers. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,2);</script>You shall
remember all the way which Yahweh your God has led you these forty years
in the wilderness, that he might humble you, to prove you, to know what
was in your heart, whether you would keep his commandments, or not.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,3);</script>He humbled you, and
allowed you to be hungry, and fed you with manna, which you didn’t know,
neither did your fathers know; that he might make you know that man does
not live by bread only, but man lives by everything that proceeds out of
the mouth of Yahweh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,4);</script>Your
clothing didn’t grow old on you, neither did your foot swell, these
forty years. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,5);</script>You shall
consider in your heart that as a man chastens his son, so Yahweh your God
chastens you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,6);</script>You shall
keep the commandments of Yahweh your God, to walk in his ways, and to fear
him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,7);</script>For Yahweh your God
brings you into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of springs, and
underground water flowing into valleys and hills; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,8);</script>a land of wheat and barley, and
vines and fig trees and pomegranates; a land of olive trees and honey;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,9);</script>a land in which you shall
eat bread without scarceness, you shall not lack anything in it; a land
whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills you may dig copper. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,10);</script>You shall eat and be full, and
you shall bless Yahweh your God for the good land which he has given you.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,11);</script>Beware lest you forget
Yahweh your God, in not keeping his commandments, and his ordinances, and
his statutes, which I command you this day: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,12);</script>lest, when you have eaten and are
full, and have built goodly houses, and lived therein; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,13);</script>and when your herds and your
flocks multiply, and your silver and your gold is multiplied, and all that
you have is multiplied; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,14);</script>then your heart be lifted up, and
you forget Yahweh your God, who brought you forth out of the land of
Egypt, out of the house of bondage; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,15);</script>who led you through the great and
terrible wilderness, with fiery serpents and scorpions, and thirsty ground
where there was no water; who brought you forth water out of the rock of
flint; <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,16);</script>who fed you in the
wilderness with manna, which your fathers didn’t know; that he might
humble you, and that he might prove you, to do you good at your latter
end: <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,17);</script>and lest you say in
your heart, “My power and the might of my hand has gotten me this
wealth.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,18);</script>But you shall
remember Yahweh your God, for it is he who gives you power to get wealth;
that he may establish his covenant which he swore to your fathers, as at
this day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,19);</script>It shall be, if you
shall forget Yahweh your God, and walk after other gods, and serve them,
and worship them, I testify against you this day that you shall surely
perish. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,20);</script>As the nations
that Yahweh makes to perish before you, so you shall perish; because you
wouldn’t listen to the voice of Yahweh your God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,1);</script>Hear, Israel: you are
to pass over the Jordan this day, to go in to dispossess nations greater
and mightier than yourself, cities great and fortified up to the sky,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,2);</script>a people great and tall,
the sons of the Anakim, whom you know, and of whom you have heard say,
“Who can stand before the sons of Anak?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,3);</script>Know therefore this day, that
Yahweh your God is he who goes over before you as a devouring fire; he
will destroy them, and he will bring them down before you: so you shall
drive them out, and make them to perish quickly, as Yahweh has spoken to
you.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,4);</script>Don’t say in your
heart, after Yahweh your God has thrust them out from before you, saying,
“For my righteousness Yahweh has brought me in to possess this land”;
because Yahweh drives them out before you because of the wickedness of
these nations. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,5);</script>Not for
your righteousness, or for the uprightness of your heart, do you go in to
possess their land; but for the wickedness of these nations Yahweh your
God does drive them out from before you, and that he may establish the
word which Yahweh swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to
Jacob. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,6);</script>Know therefore,
that Yahweh your God doesn’t give you this good land to possess it for
your righteousness; for you are a stiff-necked people. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,7);</script>Remember, don’t forget, how you
provoked Yahweh your God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that you
went forth out of the land of Egypt, until you came to this place, you
have been rebellious against Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,8);</script>Also in Horeb you provoked Yahweh
to wrath, and Yahweh was angry with you to destroy you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,9);</script>When I was gone up onto the
mountain to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant
which Yahweh made with you, then I stayed on the mountain forty days and
forty nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,10);</script>Yahweh delivered to me the two
tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them were all the
words which Yahweh spoke with you on the mountain out of the midst of the
fire in the day of the assembly.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,11);</script>It came to pass at the
end of forty days and forty nights, that Yahweh gave me the two tables of
stone, even the tables of the covenant. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,12);</script>Yahweh said to me, “Arise, get
down quickly from here; for your people whom you have brought out of Egypt
have corrupted themselves; they have quickly turned aside out of the way
which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,13);</script>Furthermore Yahweh
spoke to me, saying, “I have seen this people, and behold, it is a
stiff-necked people: <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,14);</script>let
me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under the
sky; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,15);</script>So I turned and came
down from the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire: and the
two tables of the covenant were in my two hands. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,16);</script>I looked, and behold, you had
sinned against Yahweh your God; you had made yourselves a molten calf: you
had turned aside quickly out of the way which Yahweh had commanded you.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,17);</script>I took hold of the two
tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and broke them before your
eyes. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,18);</script>I fell down before
Yahweh, as at the first, forty days and forty nights; I neither ate bread
nor drank water; because of all your sin which you sinned, in doing that
which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,19);</script>For I was afraid of the anger and
hot displeasure, with which Yahweh was angry against you to destroy you.
But Yahweh listened to me that time also. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,20);</script>Yahweh was very angry with Aaron
to destroy him: and I prayed for Aaron also at the same time. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,21);</script>I took your sin, the calf which
you had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, grinding it very
small, until it was as fine as dust: and I cast its dust into the brook
that descended out of the mountain. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,22);</script>At Taberah, and at Massah, and at
Kibroth Hattaavah, you provoked Yahweh to wrath. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,23);</script>When Yahweh sent you from Kadesh
Barnea, saying, “Go up and possess the land which I have given you”;
then you rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh your God, and you
didn’t believe him, nor listen to his voice. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,24);</script>You have been rebellious against
Yahweh from the day that I knew you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,25);</script>So I fell down before Yahweh the
forty days and forty nights that I fell down, because Yahweh had said he
would destroy you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,26);</script>I
prayed to Yahweh, and said, “Lord Yahweh, don’t destroy your people
and your inheritance, that you have redeemed through your greatness, that
you have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,27);</script>Remember your servants, Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob; don’t look to the stubbornness of this people, nor to
their wickedness, nor to their sin, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,28);</script>lest the land you brought us out
from say, ‘Because Yahweh was not able to bring them into the land which
he promised to them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to
kill them in the wilderness.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,29);</script>Yet they are your people and your
inheritance, which you brought out by your great power and by your
outstretched arm.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,1);</script>At that time Yahweh
said to me, “Cut two tables of stone like the first, and come up to me
onto the mountain, and make an ark of wood. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,2);</script>I will write on the tables the
words that were on the first tables which you broke, and you shall put
them in the ark.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,3);</script>So I
made an ark of acacia wood, and cut two tables of stone like the first,
and went up onto the mountain, having the two tables in my hand. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,4);</script>He wrote on the tables, according
to the first writing, the ten commandments, which Yahweh spoke to you on
the mountain out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and
Yahweh gave them to me. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,5);</script>I
turned and came down from the mountain, and put the tables in the ark
which I had made; and there they are as Yahweh commanded me. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,6);</script>(The children of Israel traveled
from Beeroth Bene Jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died, and there he was
buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest’s office in his
place. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,7);</script>From there they
traveled to Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of brooks of
water. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,8);</script>At that time
Yahweh set apart the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of
Yahweh, to stand before Yahweh to minister to him, and to bless in his
name, to this day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,9);</script>Therefore Levi has no portion nor
inheritance with his brothers; Yahweh is his inheritance, according as
Yahweh your God spoke to him.) <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,10);</script>I stayed on the mountain, as at
the first time, forty days and forty nights: and Yahweh listened to me
that time also; Yahweh would not destroy you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,11);</script>Yahweh said to me, “Arise,
take your journey before the people; and they shall go in and possess the
land, which I swore to their fathers to give to them.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,12);</script>Now, Israel, what
does Yahweh your God require of you, but to fear Yahweh your God, to walk
in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve Yahweh your God with all
your heart and with all your soul, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,13);</script>to keep the commandments of
Yahweh, and his statutes, which I command you this day for your good?
<script type="text/javascript">cb(10,14);</script>Behold, to Yahweh your
God belongs heaven and the heaven of heavens, the earth, with all that is
therein. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,15);</script>Only Yahweh had
a delight in your fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after
them, even you above all peoples, as at this day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,16);</script>Circumcise therefore the
foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiff-necked. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,17);</script>For Yahweh your God, he is God
of gods, and Lord of lords, the great God, the mighty, and the awesome,
who doesn’t respect persons, nor takes reward. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,18);</script>He does execute justice for the
fatherless and widow, and loves the foreigner, in giving him food and
clothing. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,19);</script>Therefore love
the foreigner; for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,20);</script>You shall fear Yahweh your God;
you shall serve him; and you shall cling to him, and you shall swear by
his name. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,21);</script>He is your
praise, and he is your God, who has done for you these great and awesome
things, which your eyes have seen. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,22);</script>Your fathers went down into
Egypt with seventy persons; and now Yahweh your God has made you as the
stars of the sky for multitude.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,1);</script>Therefore you shall
love Yahweh your God, and keep his instructions, and his statutes, and his
ordinances, and his commandments, always. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,2);</script>Know this day: for I don’t
speak with your children who have not known, and who have not seen the
chastisement of Yahweh your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his
outstretched arm, <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,3);</script>and his
signs, and his works, which he did in the midst of Egypt to Pharaoh the
king of Egypt, and to all his land; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,4);</script>and what he did to the army of
Egypt, to their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of
the <a href="#N6">Red Sea</a> to overflow them as they pursued after you,
and how Yahweh has destroyed them to this day; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,5);</script>and what he did to you in the
wilderness, until you came to this place; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,6);</script>and what he did to Dathan and
Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben; how the earth opened its
mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and
every living thing that followed them, in the midst of all Israel: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,7);</script>but your eyes have seen all the
great work of Yahweh which he did. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,8);</script>Therefore you shall keep all the
commandment which I command you this day, that you may be strong, and go
in and possess the land, where you go over to possess it; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,9);</script>and that you may prolong your
days in the land, which Yahweh swore to your fathers to give to them and
to their seed, a land flowing with milk and honey. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,10);</script>For the land, where you go in to
possess it, isn’t as the land of Egypt, that you came out from, where
you sowed your seed, and watered it with your foot, as a garden of herbs;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,11);</script>but the land, where you
go over to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys which drinks water
of the rain of the sky, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,12);</script>a land which Yahweh your God
cares for: the eyes of Yahweh your God are always on it, from the
beginning of the year even to the end of the year. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,13);</script>It shall happen, if you shall
listen diligently to my commandments which I command you this day, to love
Yahweh your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your
soul, <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,14);</script>that I will give
the rain of your land in its season, the former rain and the latter rain,
that you may gather in your grain, and your new wine, and your oil.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,15);</script>I will give grass in
your fields for your livestock, and you shall eat and be full. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,16);</script>Take heed to yourselves, lest
your heart be deceived, and you turn aside, and serve other gods, and
worship them; <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,17);</script>and the
anger of Yahweh be kindled against you, and he shut up the sky, so that
there shall be no rain, and the land shall not yield its fruit; and you
perish quickly from off the good land which Yahweh gives you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,18);</script>Therefore you shall lay up these
my words in your heart and in your soul; and you shall bind them for a
sign on your hand, and they shall be for symbols between your eyes.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,19);</script>You shall teach them
your children, talking of them, when you sit in your house, and when you
walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,20);</script>You shall write them on the door
posts of your house, and on your gates; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,21);</script>that your days may be
multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which Yahweh swore
to your fathers to give them, as the days of the heavens above the earth.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,22);</script>For if you shall
diligently keep all this commandment which I command you, to do it, to
love Yahweh your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cling to him;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,23);</script>then will Yahweh drive
out all these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess nations
greater and mightier than yourselves. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,24);</script>Every place whereon the sole of
your foot shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness, and Lebanon,
from the river, the river Euphrates, even to the hinder sea shall be your
border. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,25);</script>No man shall be
able to stand before you: Yahweh your God shall lay the fear of you and
the dread of you on all the land that you shall tread on, as he has spoken
to you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,26);</script>Behold, I set
before you this day a blessing and a curse: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,27);</script>the blessing, if you shall
listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God, which I command you this
day; <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,28);</script>and the curse, if
you shall not listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God, but turn
aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods,
which you have not known. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,29);</script>It shall happen, when Yahweh
your God shall bring you into the land where you go to possess it, that
you shall set the blessing on Mount Gerizim, and the curse on Mount Ebal.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,30);</script>Aren’t they beyond the
Jordan, behind the way of the going down of the sun, in the land of the
Canaanites who dwell in the Arabah, over against Gilgal, beside the oaks
of Moreh? <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,31);</script>For you are to
pass over the Jordan to go in to possess the land which Yahweh your God
gives you, and you shall possess it, and dwell therein. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,32);</script>You shall observe to do all the
statutes and the ordinances which I set before you this day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,1);</script>These are the statutes
and the ordinances which you shall observe to do in the land which Yahweh,
the God of your fathers, has given you to possess it, all the days that
you live on the earth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,2);</script>You shall surely destroy all the
places in which the nations that you shall dispossess served their gods,
on the high mountains, and on the hills, and under every green tree:
<script type="text/javascript">cb(12,3);</script>and you shall break down
their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and burn their Asherim
with fire; and you shall cut down the engraved images of their gods; and
you shall destroy their name out of that place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,4);</script>You shall not do so to Yahweh
your God. <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,5);</script>But to the
place which Yahweh your God shall choose out of all your tribes, to put
his name there, even to his habitation you shall seek, and there you shall
come; <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,6);</script>and there you shall
bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the
wave offering of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings,
and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,7);</script>and there you shall eat before
Yahweh your God, and you shall rejoice in all that you put your hand to,
you and your households, in which Yahweh your God has blessed you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,8);</script>You shall not do after all the
things that we do here this day, every man whatever is right in his own
eyes; <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,9);</script>for you haven’t
yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which Yahweh your God gives
you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,10);</script>But when you go
over the Jordan, and dwell in the land which Yahweh your God causes you to
inherit, and he gives you rest from all your enemies around you, so that
you dwell in safety; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,11);</script>then it shall happen that to the
place which Yahweh your God shall choose, to cause his name to dwell
there, there you shall bring all that I command you: your burnt offerings,
and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the wave offering of your hand, and
all your choice vows which you vow to Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,12);</script>You shall rejoice before Yahweh
your God, you, and your sons, and your daughters, and your male servants,
and your female servants, and the Levite who is within your gates, because
he has no portion nor inheritance with you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,13);</script>Take heed to yourself that you
don’t offer your burnt offerings in every place that you see; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,14);</script>but in the place which Yahweh
shall choose in one of your tribes, there you shall offer your burnt
offerings, and there you shall do all that I command you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,15);</script>Notwithstanding, you may kill
and eat flesh within all your gates, after all the desire of your soul,
according to the blessing of Yahweh your God which he has given you: the
unclean and the clean may eat of it, as of the gazelle, and as of the
hart. <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,16);</script>Only you shall not
eat the blood; you shall pour it out on the earth as water. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,17);</script>You may not eat within your
gates the tithe of your grain, or of your new wine, or of your oil, or the
firstborn of your herd or of your flock, nor any of your vows which you
vow, nor your freewill offerings, nor the wave offering of your hand;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(12,18);</script>but you shall eat them
before Yahweh your God in the place which Yahweh your God shall choose,
you, and your son, and your daughter, and your male servant, and your
female servant, and the Levite who is within your gates: and you shall
rejoice before Yahweh your God in all that you put your hand to. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,19);</script>Take heed to yourself that you
don’t forsake the Levite as long as you live in your land.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,20);</script>When Yahweh your God
shall enlarge your border, as he has promised you, and you shall say, “I
want to eat meat,” because your soul desires to eat meat; you may eat
meat, after all the desire of your soul. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,21);</script>If the place which Yahweh your
God shall choose, to put his name there, is too far from you, then you
shall kill of your herd and of your flock, which Yahweh has given you, as
I have commanded you; and you may eat within your gates, after all the
desire of your soul. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,22);</script>Even as the gazelle and as the
hart is eaten, so you shall eat of it: the unclean and the clean may eat
of it alike. <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,23);</script>Only be
sure that you don’t eat the blood: for the blood is the life; and you
shall not eat the life with the flesh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,24);</script>You shall not eat it; you shall
pour it out on the earth as water. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,25);</script>You shall not eat it; that it
may go well with you, and with your children after you, when you shall do
that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,26);</script>Only your holy things which you
have, and your vows, you shall take, and go to the place which Yahweh
shall choose: <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,27);</script>and you
shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, on the altar of
Yahweh your God; and the blood of your sacrifices shall be poured out on
the altar of Yahweh your God; and you shall eat the flesh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,28);</script>Observe and hear all these words
which I command you, that it may go well with you, and with your children
after you forever, when you do that which is good and right in the eyes of
Yahweh your God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,29);</script>When Yahweh your God
shall cut off the nations from before you, where you go in to dispossess
them, and you dispossess them, and dwell in their land; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,30);</script>take heed to yourself that you
not be ensnared to follow them, after that they are destroyed from before
you; and that you not inquire after their gods, saying, “How do these
nations serve their gods? I will do likewise.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,31);</script>You shall not do so to Yahweh
your God: for every abomination to Yahweh, which he hates, have they done
to their gods; for even their sons and their daughters do they burn in the
fire to their gods. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,32);</script>Whatever thing I command you,
that you shall observe to do: you shall not add thereto, nor diminish from
it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,1);</script>If there arise in the
midst of you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and he give you a sign or
a wonder, <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,2);</script>and the sign or
the wonder come to pass, of which he spoke to you, saying, “Let us go
after other gods” (which you have not known) “and let us serve
them”; <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,3);</script>you shall not
listen to the words of that prophet, or to that dreamer of dreams: for
Yahweh your God proves you, to know whether you love Yahweh your God with
all your heart and with all your soul. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,4);</script>You shall walk after Yahweh your
God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and you
shall serve him, and cling to him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,5);</script>That prophet, or that dreamer of
dreams, shall be put to death, because he has spoken rebellion against
Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed
you out of the house of bondage, to draw you aside out of the way which
Yahweh your God commanded you to walk in. So you shall put away the evil
from the midst of you.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,6);</script>If your brother, the
son of your mother, or your son, or your daughter, or the wife of your
bosom, or your friend, who is as your own soul, entice you secretly,
saying, “Let us go and serve other gods,” which you have not known,
you, nor your fathers; <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,7);</script>of
the gods of the peoples who are around you, near to you, or far off from
you, from the one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,8);</script>you shall not consent to
him, nor listen to him; neither shall your eye pity him, neither shall you
spare, neither shall you conceal him: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,9);</script>but you shall surely kill him;
your hand shall be first on him to put him to death, and afterwards the
hand of all the people. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,10);</script>You shall stone him to death
with stones, because he has sought to draw you away from Yahweh your God,
who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,11);</script>All Israel shall hear,
and fear, and shall not do any more such wickedness as this is in the
midst of you.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,12);</script>If you shall hear
tell concerning one of your cities, which Yahweh your God gives you to
dwell there, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,13);</script>Certain base fellows are gone
out from the midst of you, and have drawn away the inhabitants of their
city, saying, “Let us go and serve other gods,” which you have not
known; <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,14);</script>then you shall
inquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and, behold, if it be truth,
and the thing certain, that such abomination is done in the midst of you,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,15);</script>you shall surely strike
the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it
utterly, and all that is therein and its livestock, with the edge of the
sword. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,16);</script>You shall gather
all its spoil into the midst of its street, and shall burn with fire the
city, and all its spoil every whit, to Yahweh your God: and it shall be a
heap forever; it shall not be built again. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,17);</script>Nothing of the devoted thing
shall cling to your hand; that Yahweh may turn from the fierceness of his
anger, and show you mercy, and have compassion on you, and multiply you,
as he has sworn to your fathers; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,18);</script>when you shall listen to the
voice of Yahweh your God, to keep all his commandments which I command you
this day, to do that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh your God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,1);</script>You are the children
of Yahweh your God: you shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness
between your eyes for the dead. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,2);</script>For you are a holy people to
Yahweh your God, and Yahweh has chosen you to be a people for his own
possession, above all peoples who are on the face of the earth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,3);</script>You shall not eat any abominable
thing. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,4);</script>These are the
animals which you may eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,5);</script>the hart, and the gazelle, and
the roebuck, and the wild goat, and the ibex, and the antelope, and the
chamois. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,6);</script>Every animal
that parts the hoof, and has the hoof cloven in two and chews the cud,
among the animals, that may you eat. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,7);</script>Nevertheless these you shall not
eat of them that chew the cud, or of those who have the hoof cloven: the
camel, and the hare, and the rabbit; because they chew the cud but don’t
part the hoof, they are unclean to you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,8);</script>The pig, because it has a split
hoof but doesn’t chew the cud, is unclean to you: of their flesh you
shall not eat, and their carcasses you shall not touch. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,9);</script>These you may eat of all that are
in the waters: whatever has fins and scales may you eat; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,10);</script>and whatever doesn’t have fins
and scales you shall not eat; it is unclean to you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,11);</script>Of all clean birds you may eat.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(14,12);</script>But these are they of
which you shall not eat: the eagle, and the vulture, and the osprey,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(14,13);</script>and the red kite, and
the falcon, and the kite after its kind, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,14);</script>and every raven after its kind,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(14,15);</script>and the ostrich, and the
owl, and the seagull, and the hawk after its kind, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,16);</script>the little owl, and the great
owl, and the horned owl, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,17);</script>and the pelican, and the
vulture, and the cormorant, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,18);</script>and the stork, and the heron
after its kind, and the hoopoe, and the bat. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,19);</script>All winged creeping things are
unclean to you: they shall not be eaten. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,20);</script>Of all clean birds you may eat.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(14,21);</script>You shall not eat of
anything that dies of itself: you may give it to the foreigner living
among you who is within your gates, that he may eat it; or you may sell it
to a foreigner: for you are a holy people to Yahweh your God. You shall
not boil a young goat in its mother’s milk. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,22);</script>You shall surely tithe all the
increase of your seed, that which comes forth from the field year by year.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(14,23);</script>You shall eat before
Yahweh your God, in the place which he shall choose, to cause his name to
dwell there, the tithe of your grain, of your new wine, and of your oil,
and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock; that you may learn to
fear Yahweh your God always. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,24);</script>If the way is too long for you,
so that you are not able to carry it, because the place is too far from
you, which Yahweh your God shall choose, to set his name there, when
Yahweh your God shall bless you; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,25);</script>then you shall turn it into
money, and bind up the money in your hand, and shall go to the place which
Yahweh your God shall choose: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,26);</script>and you shall bestow the money
for whatever your soul desires, for cattle, or for sheep, or for wine, or
for strong drink, or for whatever your soul asks of you; and you shall eat
there before Yahweh your God, and you shall rejoice, you and your
household. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,27);</script>The Levite
who is within your gates, you shall not forsake him; for he has no portion
nor inheritance with you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,28);</script>At the end of every three years
you shall bring forth all the tithe of your increase in the same year, and
shall lay it up within your gates: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,29);</script>and the Levite, because he has
no portion nor inheritance with you, and the foreigner living among you,
and the fatherless, and the widow, who are within your gates, shall come,
and shall eat and be satisfied; that Yahweh your God may bless you in all
the work of your hand which you do.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,1);</script>At the end of every
seven years you shall make a release. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,2);</script>This is the way of the release:
every creditor shall release that which he has lent to his neighbor; he
shall not exact it of his neighbor and his brother; because Yahweh’s
release has been proclaimed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,3);</script>Of a foreigner you may exact it:
but whatever of your is with your brother your hand shall release. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,4);</script>However there shall be no poor
with you; (for Yahweh will surely bless you in the land which Yahweh your
God gives you for an inheritance to possess it;) <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,5);</script>if only you diligently listen to
the voice of Yahweh your God, to observe to do all this commandment which
I command you this day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,6);</script>For Yahweh your God will bless
you, as he promised you: and you shall lend to many nations, but you shall
not borrow; and you shall rule over many nations, but they shall not rule
over you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,7);</script>If a poor man,
one of your brothers, is with you within any of your gates in your land
which Yahweh your God gives you, you shall not harden your heart, nor shut
your hand from your poor brother; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,8);</script>but you shall surely open your
hand to him, and shall surely lend him sufficient for his need, which he
lacks. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,9);</script>Beware that there
not be a base thought in your heart, saying, “The seventh year, the year
of release, is at hand”; and your eye be evil against your poor brother,
and you give him nothing; and he cry to Yahweh against you, and it be sin
to you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,10);</script>You shall surely
give him, and your heart shall not be grieved when you give to him;
because that for this thing Yahweh your God will bless you in all your
work, and in all that you put your hand to. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,11);</script>For the poor will never cease
out of the land: therefore I command you, saying, You shall surely open
your hand to your brother, to your needy, and to your poor, in your land.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(15,12);</script>If your brother, a
Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman, is sold to you, and serves you six years;
then in the seventh year you shall let him go free from you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,13);</script>When you let him go free from
you, you shall not let him go empty: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,14);</script>you shall furnish him liberally
out of your flock, and out of your threshing floor, and out of your
winepress; as Yahweh your God has blessed you, you shall give to him.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(15,15);</script>You shall remember that
you were a bondservant in the land of Egypt, and Yahweh your God redeemed
you: therefore I command you this thing today. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,16);</script>It shall be, if he tells you,
“I will not go out from you”; because he loves you and your house,
because he is well with you; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,17);</script>then you shall take an awl, and
thrust it through his ear to the door, and he shall be your servant
forever. Also to your female servant you shall do likewise. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,18);</script>It shall not seem hard to you,
when you let him go free from you; for to the double of the hire of a
hireling has he served you six years: and Yahweh your God will bless you
in all that you do. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,19);</script>All
the firstborn males that are born of your herd and of your flock you shall
sanctify to Yahweh your God: you shall do no work with the firstborn of
your herd, nor shear the firstborn of your flock. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,20);</script>You shall eat it before Yahweh
your God year by year in the place which Yahweh shall choose, you and your
household. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,21);</script>If it has any
blemish, is lame or blind, or has any defect whatever, you shall not
sacrifice it to Yahweh your God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,22);</script>You shall eat it within your
gates: the unclean and the clean shall eat it alike, as the gazelle, and
as the hart. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,23);</script>Only you
shall not eat its blood; you shall pour it out on the ground as water.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,1);</script>Observe the month of
Abib, and keep the Passover to Yahweh your God; for in the month of Abib
Yahweh your God brought you forth out of Egypt by night. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,2);</script>You shall sacrifice the Passover
to Yahweh your God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which Yahweh
shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,3);</script>You shall eat no leavened bread
with it. You shall eat unleavened bread with it seven days, even the bread
of affliction; for you came forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that
you may remember the day when you came forth out of the land of Egypt all
the days of your life. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,4);</script>No
yeast shall be seen with you in all your borders seven days; neither shall
any of the flesh, which you sacrifice the first day at evening, remain all
night until the morning. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,5);</script>You may not sacrifice the
Passover within any of your gates, which Yahweh your God gives you;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(16,6);</script>but at the place which
Yahweh your God shall choose, to cause his name to dwell in, there you
shall sacrifice the Passover at evening, at the going down of the sun, at
the season that you came forth out of Egypt. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,7);</script>You shall roast and eat it in the
place which Yahweh your God shall choose: and you shall turn in the
morning, and go to your tents. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,8);</script>Six days you shall eat unleavened
bread. On the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to Yahweh your God;
you shall do no work. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,9);</script>You
shall count for yourselves seven weeks: from the time you begin to put the
sickle to the standing grain you shall begin to number seven weeks.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(16,10);</script>You shall keep the feast
of weeks to Yahweh your God with a tribute of a freewill offering of your
hand, which you shall give, according as Yahweh your God blesses you:
<script type="text/javascript">cb(16,11);</script>and you shall rejoice
before Yahweh your God, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your
male servant, and your female servant, and the Levite who is within your
gates, and the foreigner, and the fatherless, and the widow, who are in
the midst of you, in the place which Yahweh your God shall choose, to
cause his name to dwell there. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,12);</script>You shall remember that you were
a bondservant in Egypt: and you shall observe and do these statutes.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(16,13);</script>You shall keep the feast
of tents seven days, after that you have gathered in from your threshing
floor and from your winepress: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,14);</script>and you shall rejoice in your
feast, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your male servant, and
your female servant, and the Levite, and the foreigner, and the
fatherless, and the widow, who are within your gates. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,15);</script>You shall keep a feast to Yahweh
your God seven days in the place which Yahweh shall choose; because Yahweh
your God will bless you in all your increase, and in all the work of your
hands, and you shall be altogether joyful. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,16);</script>Three times in a year shall all
your males appear before Yahweh your God in the place which he shall
choose: in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and
in the feast of tents; and they shall not appear before Yahweh empty:
<script type="text/javascript">cb(16,17);</script>every man shall give as
he is able, according to the blessing of Yahweh your God which he has
given you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,18);</script>You shall
make judges and officers in all your gates, which Yahweh your God gives
you, according to your tribes; and they shall judge the people with
righteous judgment. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,19);</script>You
shall not wrest justice: you shall not respect persons; neither shall you
take a bribe; for a bribe does blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the
words of the righteous. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,20);</script>You shall follow that which is
altogether just, that you may live, and inherit the land which Yahweh your
God gives you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,21);</script>You shall
not plant for yourselves an Asherah of any kind of tree beside the altar
of Yahweh your God, which you shall make for yourselves. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,22);</script>Neither shall you set yourself
up a pillar; which Yahweh your God hates.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,1);</script>You shall not
sacrifice to Yahweh your God an ox, or a sheep, in which is a blemish, or
anything evil; for that is an abomination to Yahweh your God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,2);</script>If there is found in the midst of
you, within any of your gates which Yahweh your God gives you, man or
woman, who does that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh your God, in
transgressing his covenant, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,3);</script>and has gone and served other
gods, and worshiped them, or the sun, or the moon, or any of the army of
the sky, which I have not commanded; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,4);</script>and it be told you, and you have
heard of it, then you shall inquire diligently; and behold, if it be true,
and the thing certain, that such abomination is done in Israel, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,5);</script>then you shall bring forth that
man or that woman, who has done this evil thing, to your gates, even the
man or the woman; and you shall stone them to death with stones. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,6);</script>At the mouth of two witnesses, or
three witnesses, shall he who is to die be put to death; at the mouth of
one witness he shall not be put to death. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,7);</script>The hand of the witnesses shall
be first on him to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the
people. So you shall put away the evil from the midst of you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,8);</script>If there arises a matter too hard
for you in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and
between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy within your gates;
then you shall arise, and go up to the place which Yahweh your God shall
choose; <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,9);</script>and you shall
come to the priests the Levites, and to the judge who shall be in those
days: and you shall inquire; and they shall show you the sentence of
judgment. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,10);</script>You shall do
according to the tenor of the sentence which they shall show you from that
place which Yahweh shall choose; and you shall observe to do according to
all that they shall teach you: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,11);</script>according to the tenor of the
law which they shall teach you, and according to the judgment which they
shall tell you, you shall do; you shall not turn aside from the sentence
which they shall show you, to the right hand, nor to the left. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,12);</script>The man who does presumptuously,
in not listening to the priest who stands to minister there before Yahweh
your God, or to the judge, even that man shall die: and you shall put away
the evil from Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,13);</script>All the people shall hear, and
fear, and do no more presumptuously.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,14);</script>When you have come to
the land which Yahweh your God gives you, and shall possess it, and shall
dwell therein, and shall say, “I will set a king over me, like all the
nations that are around me”; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,15);</script>you shall surely set him king
over yourselves, whom Yahweh your God shall choose: one from among your
brothers you shall set king over you; you may not put a foreigner over
you, who is not your brother. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,16);</script>Only he shall not multiply
horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end
that he may multiply horses; because Yahweh has said to you, “You shall
not go back that way again.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,17);</script>Neither shall he multiply wives
to himself, that his heart not turn away: neither shall he greatly
multiply to himself silver and gold.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,18);</script>It shall be, when he
sits on the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this
law in a book, out of that which is before the priests the Levites:
<script type="text/javascript">cb(17,19);</script>and it shall be with
him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life; that he may learn
to fear Yahweh his God, to keep all the words of this law and these
statutes, to do them; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,20);</script>that his heart not be lifted up
above his brothers, and that he not turn aside from the commandment, to
the right hand, or to the left: to the end that he may prolong his days in
his kingdom, he and his children, in the midst of Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,1);</script>The priests the
Levites, all the tribe of Levi, shall have no portion nor inheritance with
Israel: they shall eat the offerings of Yahweh made by fire, and his
inheritance. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,2);</script>They shall
have no inheritance among their brothers: Yahweh is their inheritance, as
he has spoken to them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,3);</script>This shall be the priests’ due
from the people, from those who offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or
sheep, that they shall give to the priest the shoulder, and the two
cheeks, and the maw. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,4);</script>The
first fruits of your grain, of your new wine, and of your oil, and the
first of the fleece of your sheep, you shall give him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,5);</script>For Yahweh your God has chosen
him out of all your tribes, to stand to minister in the name of Yahweh,
him and his sons for ever. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,6);</script>If a Levite comes from any of
your gates out of all Israel, where he lives as a foreigner, and comes
with all the desire of his soul to the place which Yahweh shall choose;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,7);</script>then he shall minister in
the name of Yahweh his God, as all his brothers the Levites do, who stand
there before Yahweh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,8);</script>They
shall have like portions to eat, besides that which comes of the sale of
his patrimony. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,9);</script>When you
have come into the land which Yahweh your God gives you, you shall not
learn to do after the abominations of those nations. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,10);</script>There shall not be found with
you anyone who makes his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, one
who uses divination, one who practices sorcery, or an enchanter, or a
sorcerer, <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,11);</script>or a charmer,
or a consulter with a familiar spirit, or a wizard, or a necromancer.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,12);</script>For whoever does these
things is an abomination to Yahweh: and because of these abominations
Yahweh your God does drive them out from before you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,13);</script>You shall be perfect with Yahweh
your God. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,14);</script>For these
nations, that you shall dispossess, listen to those who practice sorcery,
and to diviners; but as for you, Yahweh your God has not allowed you so to
do. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,15);</script>Yahweh your God will
raise up to you a prophet from the midst of you, of your brothers, like
me. You shall listen to him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,16);</script>This is according to all that
you desired of Yahweh your God in Horeb in the day of the assembly,
saying, “Let me not hear again the voice of Yahweh my God, neither let
me see this great fire any more, that I not die.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,17);</script>Yahweh said to me,
“They have well said that which they have spoken. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,18);</script>I will raise them up a prophet
from among their brothers, like you; and I will put my words in his mouth,
and he shall speak to them all that I shall command him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,19);</script>It shall happen, that whoever
will not listen to my words which he shall speak in my name, I will
require it of him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,20);</script>But
the prophet, who shall speak a word presumptuously in my name, which I
have not commanded him to speak, or who shall speak in the name of other
gods, that same prophet shall die.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,21);</script>If you say in your
heart, “How shall we know the word which Yahweh has not spoken?”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,22);</script>when a prophet speaks in
the name of Yahweh, if the thing doesn’t follow, nor happen, that is the
thing which Yahweh has not spoken: the prophet has spoken it
presumptuously, you shall not be afraid of him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,1);</script>When Yahweh your God
shall cut off the nations, whose land Yahweh your God gives you, and you
succeed them, and dwell in their cities, and in their houses; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,2);</script>you shall set apart three cities
for you in the midst of your land, which Yahweh your God gives you to
possess it. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,3);</script>You shall
prepare you the way, and divide the borders of your land, which Yahweh
your God causes you to inherit, into three parts, that every manslayer may
flee there. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,4);</script>This is the
case of the manslayer, that shall flee there and live: whoever kills his
neighbor unawares, and didn’t hate him in time past; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,5);</script>as when a man goes into the
forest with his neighbor to chop wood, and his hand fetches a stroke with
the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slips from the handle, and
lights on his neighbor, so that he dies; he shall flee to one of these
cities and live: <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,6);</script>lest the
avenger of blood pursue the manslayer, while his heart is hot, and
overtake him, because the way is long, and strike him mortally; whereas he
was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he didn’t hate him in time past.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(19,7);</script>Therefore I command you,
saying, You shall set apart three cities for yourselves. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,8);</script>If Yahweh your God enlarges your
border, as he has sworn to your fathers, and gives you all the land which
he promised to give to your fathers; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,9);</script>if you keep all this commandment
to do it, which I command you this day, to love Yahweh your God, and to
walk ever in his ways; then you shall add three cities more for
yourselves, besides these three: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,10);</script>that innocent blood not be shed
in the midst of your land, which Yahweh your God gives you for an
inheritance, and so blood be on you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,11);</script>But if any man hates his
neighbor, and lies in wait for him, and rises up against him, and strikes
him mortally so that he dies, and he flees into one of these cities;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(19,12);</script>then the elders of his
city shall send and bring him there, and deliver him into the hand of the
avenger of blood, that he may die. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,13);</script>Your eye shall not pity him, but
you shall put away the innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well
with you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,14);</script>You shall not
remove your neighbor’s landmark, which they of old time have set, in
your inheritance which you shall inherit, in the land that Yahweh your God
gives you to possess it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,15);</script>One witness shall not rise up
against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sins:
at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall a
matter be established. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,16);</script>If an unrighteous witness rise
up against any man to testify against him of wrongdoing, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,17);</script>then both the men, between whom
the controversy is, shall stand before Yahweh, before the priests and the
judges who shall be in those days; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,18);</script>and the judges shall make
diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the witness is a false witness, and
has testified falsely against his brother; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,19);</script>then you shall do to him as he
had thought to do to his brother: so you shall put away the evil from the
midst of you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,20);</script>Those who
remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such
evil in the midst of you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,21);</script>Your eyes shall not pity: life
for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,1);</script>When you go forth to
battle against your enemies, and see horses, chariots, and a people more
than you, you shall not be afraid of them; for Yahweh your God is with
you, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,2);</script>It shall be, when you draw near
to the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak to the people,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(20,3);</script>and shall tell them,
“Hear, Israel, you draw near this day to battle against your enemies:
don’t let your heart faint; don’t be afraid, nor tremble, neither be
scared of them; <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,4);</script>for
Yahweh your God is he who goes with you, to fight for you against your
enemies, to save you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,5);</script>The officers shall
speak to the people, saying, “What man is there who has built a new
house, and has not dedicated it? Let him go and return to his house, lest
he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,6);</script>What man is there who has planted
a vineyard, and has not used its fruit? Let him go and return to his
house, lest he die in the battle, and another man use its fruit. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,7);</script>What man is there who has pledged
to be married a wife, and has not taken her? Let him go and return to his
house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,8);</script>The officers shall speak further
to the people, and they shall say, “What man is there who is fearful and
fainthearted? Let him go and return to his house, lest his brother’s
heart melt as his heart.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,9);</script>It shall be, when the officers
have made an end of speaking to the people, that they shall appoint
captains of armies at the head of the people.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,10);</script>When you draw near to
a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace to it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,11);</script>It shall be, if it makes you
answer of peace, and opens to you, then it shall be, that all the people
who are found therein shall become tributary to you, and shall serve you.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(20,12);</script>If it will make no peace
with you, but will make war against you, then you shall besiege it:
<script type="text/javascript">cb(20,13);</script>and when Yahweh your God
delivers it into your hand, you shall strike every male of it with the
edge of the sword: <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,14);</script>but
the women, and the little ones, and the livestock, and all that is in the
city, even all its spoil, you shall take for a prey to yourself; and you
shall eat the spoil of your enemies, which Yahweh your God has given you.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(20,15);</script>Thus you shall do to all
the cities which are very far off from you, which are not of the cities of
these nations. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,16);</script>But of
the cities of these peoples, that Yahweh your God gives you for an
inheritance, you shall save alive nothing that breathes; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,17);</script>but you shall utterly destroy
them: the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, the
Hivite, and the Jebusite; as Yahweh your God has commanded you; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,18);</script>that they not teach you to do
after all their abominations, which they have done to their gods; so would
you sin against Yahweh your God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,19);</script>When you shall besiege a city a
long time, in making war against it to take it, you shall not destroy its
trees by wielding an axe against them; for you may eat of them, and you
shall not cut them down; for is the tree of the field man, that it should
be besieged of you? <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,20);</script>Only
the trees of which you know that they are not trees for food, you shall
destroy and cut them down; and you shall build bulwarks against the city
that makes war with you, until it fall.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,1);</script>If one be found slain
in the land which Yahweh your God gives you to possess it, lying in the
field, and it isn’t known who has struck him; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,2);</script>then your elders and your judges
shall come forth, and they shall measure to the cities which are around
him who is slain: <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,3);</script>and it
shall be, that the city which is nearest to the slain man, even the elders
of that city shall take a heifer of the herd, which hasn’t been worked
with, and which has not drawn in the yoke; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,4);</script>and the elders of that city shall
bring down the heifer to a valley with running water, which is neither
plowed nor sown, and shall break the heifer’s neck there in the valley.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(21,5);</script>The priests the sons of
Levi shall come near; for them Yahweh your God has chosen to minister to
him, and to bless in the name of Yahweh; and according to their word shall
every controversy and every stroke be. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,6);</script>All the elders of that city, who
are nearest to the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer whose
neck was broken in the valley; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,7);</script>and they shall answer and say,
“Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(21,8);</script>Forgive, Yahweh, your
people Israel, whom you have redeemed, and don’t allow innocent blood in
the midst of your people Israel.” The blood shall be forgiven them.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(21,9);</script>So you shall put away the
innocent blood from the midst of you, when you shall do that which is
right in the eyes of Yahweh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,10);</script>When you go forth to
battle against your enemies, and Yahweh your God delivers them into your
hands, and you carry them away captive, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,11);</script>and see among the captives a
beautiful woman, and you have a desire to her, and would take her to you
as wife; <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,12);</script>then you shall
bring her home to your house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her
nails; <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,13);</script>and she shall put
the clothing of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in your
house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that
you shall go in to her, and be her husband, and she shall be your wife.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(21,14);</script>It shall be, if you have
no delight in her, then you shall let her go where she will; but you shall
not sell her at all for money, you shall not deal with her as a slave,
because you have humbled her. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,15);</script>If a man have two wives, the one
beloved, and the other hated, and they have borne him children, both the
beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn son be hers who was hated;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(21,16);</script>then it shall be, in the
day that he causes his sons to inherit that which he has, that he may not
make the son of the beloved the firstborn before the son of the hated, who
is the firstborn: <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,17);</script>but he
shall acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the hated, by giving him a
double portion of all that he has; for he is the beginning of his
strength; the right of the firstborn is his. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,18);</script>If a man have a stubborn and
rebellious son, who will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of
his mother, and, though they chasten him, will not listen to them; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,19);</script>then shall his father and his
mother lay hold on him, and bring him out to the elders of his city, and
to the gate of his place; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,20);</script>and they shall tell the elders
of his city, “This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey
our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,21);</script>All the men of his city shall
stone him to death with stones: so you shall put away the evil from the
midst of you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,22);</script>If a man have
committed a sin worthy of death, and he be put to death, and you hang him
on a tree; <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,23);</script>his body
shall not remain all night on the tree, but you shall surely bury him the
same day; for he who is hanged is accursed of God; that you don’t defile
your land which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,1);</script>You shall not see your
brother’s ox or his sheep go astray, and hide yourself from them: you
shall surely bring them again to your brother. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,2);</script>If your brother isn’t near to
you, or if you don’t know him, then you shall bring it home to your
house, and it shall be with you until your brother seek after it, and you
shall restore it to him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,3);</script>So you shall do with his donkey;
and so you shall do with his garment; and so you shall do with every lost
thing of your brother’s, which he has lost, and you have found: you may
not hide yourself. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,4);</script>You
shall not see your brother’s donkey or his ox fallen down by the way,
and hide yourself from them: you shall surely help him to lift them up
again. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,5);</script>A woman shall not
wear men’s clothing, neither shall a man put on women’s clothing; for
whoever does these things is an abomination to Yahweh your God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,6);</script>If a bird’s nest chance to be
before you in the way, in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or
eggs, and the hen sitting on the young, or on the eggs, you shall not take
the hen with the young: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,7);</script>you shall surely let the hen go,
but the young you may take to yourself; that it may be well with you, and
that you may prolong your days. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,8);</script>When you build a new house, then
you shall make a battlement for your roof, that you don’t bring blood on
your house, if any man fall from there. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,9);</script>You shall not sow your vineyard
with two kinds of seed, lest the whole fruit be forfeited, the seed which
you have sown, and the increase of the vineyard. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,10);</script>You shall not plow with an ox
and a donkey together. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,11);</script>You shall not wear a mixed
stuff, wool and linen together. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,12);</script>You shall make yourselves <a
href="#N7">fringes</a> on the four borders of your cloak, with which you
cover yourself.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,13);</script>If any man takes a
wife, and goes in to her, and hates her, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,14);</script>and accuses her of shameful
things, and brings up an evil name on her, and says, “I took this woman,
and when I came near to her, I didn’t find in her the tokens of
virginity”; <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,15);</script>then shall
the father of the young lady, and her mother, take and bring forth the
tokens of the young lady’s virginity to the elders of the city in the
gate; <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,16);</script>and the young
lady’s father shall tell the elders, “I gave my daughter to this man
to wife, and he hates her; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,17);</script>and behold, he has accused her
of shameful things, saying, ‘I didn’t find in your daughter the tokens
of virginity;’ and yet these are the tokens of my daughter’s
virginity.” They shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(22,18);</script>The elders of that city
shall take the man and chastise him; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,19);</script>and they shall fine him one
hundred shekels of silver, and give them to the father of the young lady,
because he has brought up an evil name on a virgin of Israel: and she
shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,20);</script>But if this thing be
true, that the tokens of virginity were not found in the young lady;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(22,21);</script>then they shall bring
out the young lady to the door of her father’s house, and the men of her
city shall stone her to death with stones, because she has done folly in
Israel, to play the prostitute in her father’s house: so you shall put
away the evil from the midst of you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,22);</script>If a man be found lying with a
woman married to a husband, then they shall both of them die, the man who
lay with the woman, and the woman: so you shall put away the evil from
Israel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,23);</script>If there is a
young lady who is a virgin pledged to be married to a husband, and a man
find her in the city, and lie with her; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,24);</script>then you shall bring them both
out to the gate of that city, and you shall stone them to death with
stones; the lady, because she didn’t cry, being in the city; and the
man, because he has humbled his neighbor’s wife: so you shall put away
the evil from the midst of you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,25);</script>But if the man find the lady who
is pledged to be married in the field, and the man force her, and lie with
her; then the man only who lay with her shall die: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,26);</script>but to the lady you shall do
nothing; there is in the lady no sin worthy of death: for as when a man
rises against his neighbor, and kills him, even so is this matter; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,27);</script>for he found her in the field,
the pledged to be married lady cried, and there was none to save her.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(22,28);</script>If a man find a lady who
is a virgin, who is not pledged to be married, and lay hold on her, and
lie with her, and they be found; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,29);</script>then the man who lay with her
shall give to the lady’s father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall
be his wife, because he has humbled her; he may not put her away all his
days. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,30);</script>A man shall not
take his father’s wife, and shall not uncover his father’s skirt.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,1);</script>He who is wounded in
the stones, or has his privy member cut off, shall not enter into the
assembly of Yahweh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,2);</script>A
bastard shall not enter into the assembly of Yahweh; even to the tenth
generation shall none of his enter into the assembly of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,3);</script>An Ammonite or a Moabite shall
not enter into the assembly of Yahweh; even to the tenth generation shall
none belonging to them enter into the assembly of Yahweh forever: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,4);</script>because they didn’t meet you
with bread and with water in the way, when you came forth out of Egypt,
and because they hired against you Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of
Mesopotamia, to curse you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,5);</script>Nevertheless Yahweh your God
wouldn’t listen to Balaam; but Yahweh your God turned the curse into a
blessing to you, because Yahweh your God loved you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,6);</script>You shall not seek their peace
nor their prosperity all your days forever. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,7);</script>You shall not abhor an Edomite;
for he is your brother: you shall not abhor an Egyptian, because you lived
as a foreigner in his land. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,8);</script>The children of the third
generation who are born to them shall enter into the assembly of Yahweh.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(23,9);</script>When you go forth in camp
against your enemies, then you shall keep yourselves from every evil
thing. <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,10);</script>If there is among
you any man who is not clean by reason of that which happens him by night,
then shall he go outside of the camp. He shall not come within the camp:
<script type="text/javascript">cb(23,11);</script>but it shall be, when
evening comes on, he shall bathe himself in water; and when the sun is
down, he shall come within the camp. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,12);</script>You shall have a place also
outside of the camp, where you shall go forth abroad: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,13);</script>and you shall have a paddle
among your weapons; and it shall be, when you sit down abroad, you shall
dig therewith, and shall turn back and cover that which comes from you:
<script type="text/javascript">cb(23,14);</script>for Yahweh your God
walks in the midst of your camp, to deliver you, and to give up your
enemies before you; therefore your camp shall be holy, that he may not see
an unclean thing in you, and turn away from you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,15);</script>You shall not deliver to his
master a servant who is escaped from his master to you: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,16);</script>he shall dwell with you, in the
midst of you, in the place which he shall choose within one of your gates,
where it pleases him best: you shall not oppress him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,17);</script>There shall be no prostitute of
the daughters of Israel, neither shall there be a sodomite of the sons of
Israel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,18);</script>You shall not
bring the hire of a prostitute, or the wages of a dog, into the house of
Yahweh your God for any vow: for even both these are an abomination to
Yahweh your God. <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,19);</script>You
shall not lend on interest to your brother; interest of money, interest of
food, interest of anything that is lent on interest: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,20);</script>to a foreigner you may lend on
interest; but to your brother you shall not lend on interest, that Yahweh
your God may bless you in all that you put your hand to, in the land where
you go in to possess it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,21);</script>When you shall vow a vow to
Yahweh your God, you shall not be slack to pay it: for Yahweh your God
will surely require it of you; and it would be sin in you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,22);</script>But if you shall forbear to vow,
it shall be no sin in you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,23);</script>That which is gone out of your
lips you shall observe and do; according as you have vowed to Yahweh your
God, a freewill offering, which you have promised with your mouth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,24);</script>When you come into your
neighbor’s vineyard, then you may eat of grapes your fill at your own
pleasure; but you shall not put any in your vessel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,25);</script>When you come into your
neighbor’s standing grain, then you may pluck the ears with your hand;
but you shall not move a sickle to your neighbor’s standing grain.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,1);</script>When a man takes a
wife, and marries her, then it shall be, if she find no favor in his eyes,
because he has found some unseemly thing in her, that he shall write her a
bill of divorce, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(24,2);</script>When she is departed out
of his house, she may go and be another man’s wife. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,3);</script>If the latter husband hate her,
and write her a bill of divorce, and give it in her hand, and send her out
of his house; or if the latter husband die, who took her to be his wife;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(24,4);</script>her former husband, who
sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is
defiled; for that is abomination before Yahweh: and you shall not cause
the land to sin, which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(24,5);</script>When a man takes a new
wife, he shall not go out in the army, neither shall he be assigned any
business: he shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer his wife whom
he has taken. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,6);</script>No man
shall take the mill or the upper millstone to pledge; for he takes a life
in pledge. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,7);</script>If a man be
found stealing any of his brothers of the children of Israel, and he deal
with him as a slave, or sell him; then that thief shall die: so you shall
put away the evil from the midst of you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,8);</script>Take heed in the plague of
leprosy, that you observe diligently, and do according to all that the
priests the Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them, so you shall
observe to do. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,9);</script>Remember
what Yahweh your God did to Miriam, by the way as you came forth out of
Egypt. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,10);</script>When you do lend
your neighbor any kind of loan, you shall not go into his house to get his
pledge. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,11);</script>You shall stand
outside, and the man to whom you do lend shall bring forth the pledge
outside to you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,12);</script>If he be
a poor man, you shall not sleep with his pledge; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,13);</script>you shall surely restore to him
the pledge when the sun goes down, that he may sleep in his garment, and
bless you: and it shall be righteousness to you before Yahweh your God.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(24,14);</script>You shall not oppress a
hired servant who is poor and needy, whether he be of your brothers, or of
your foreigners who are in your land within your gates: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,15);</script>in his day you shall give him
his hire, neither shall the sun go down on it; for he is poor, and sets
his heart on it: lest he cry against you to Yahweh, and it be sin to you.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(24,16);</script>The fathers shall not be
put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death
for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,17);</script>You shall not deprive the
foreigner, or the fatherless of justice, nor take a widow’s clothing in
pledge; <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,18);</script>but you shall
remember that you were a bondservant in Egypt, and Yahweh your God
redeemed you there: therefore I command you to do this thing. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,19);</script>When you reap your harvest in
your field, and have forgot a sheaf in the field, you shall not go again
to get it: it shall be for the foreigner, for the fatherless, and for the
widow; that Yahweh your God may bless you in all the work of your hands.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(24,20);</script>When you beat your olive
tree, you shall not go over the boughs again: it shall be for the
foreigner, for the fatherless, and for the widow. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,21);</script>When you harvest your vineyard,
you shall not glean it after yourselves: it shall be for the foreigner,
for the fatherless, and for the widow. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,22);</script>You shall remember that you were
a bondservant in the land of Egypt: therefore I command you to do this
thing.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,1);</script>If there is a
controversy between men, and they come to judgment, and the judges judge
them; then they shall justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(25,2);</script>and it shall be, if the
wicked man be worthy to be beaten, that the judge shall cause him to lie
down, and to be beaten before his face, according to his wickedness, by
number. <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,3);</script>Forty stripes he
may give him, he shall not exceed; lest, if he should exceed, and beat him
above these with many stripes, then your brother should seem vile to you.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(25,4);</script>You shall not muzzle the
ox when he treads out the grain. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,5);</script>If brothers dwell together, and
one of them die, and have no son, the wife of the dead shall not be
married outside to a stranger: her husband’s brother shall go in to her,
and take her to him as wife, and perform the duty of a husband’s brother
to her. <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,6);</script>It shall be, that
the firstborn whom she bears shall succeed in the name of his brother who
is dead, that his name not be blotted out of Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,7);</script>If the man doesn’t
want to take his brother’s wife, then his brother’s wife shall go up
to the gate to the elders, and say, “My husband’s brother refuses to
raise up to his brother a name in Israel; he will not perform the duty of
a husband’s brother to me.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,8);</script>Then the elders of his city shall
call him, and speak to him: and if he stand, and say, “I don’t want to
take her”; <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,9);</script>then his
brother’s wife shall come to him in the presence of the elders, and
loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face; and she shall
answer and say, “So shall it be done to the man who does not build up
his brother’s house.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,10);</script>His name shall be called in
Israel, The house of him who has his shoe untied.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,11);</script>When men strive
together one with another, and the wife of the one draws near to deliver
her husband out of the hand of him who strikes him, and puts forth her
hand, and takes him by the secrets; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,12);</script>then you shall cut off her hand,
your eye shall have no pity.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,13);</script>You shall not have in
your bag diverse weights, a great and a small. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,14);</script>You shall not have in your house
diverse measures, a great and a small. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,15);</script>You shall have a perfect and
just weight. You shall have a perfect and just measure, that your days may
be long in the land which Yahweh your God gives you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,16);</script>For all who do such things, all
who do unrighteously, are an abomination to Yahweh your God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,17);</script>Remember what Amalek did to you
by the way as you came forth out of Egypt; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,18);</script>how he met you by the way, and
struck the hindmost of you, all who were feeble behind you, when you were
faint and weary; and he didn’t fear God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,19);</script>Therefore it shall be, when
Yahweh your God has given you rest from all your enemies all around, in
the land which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance to possess it,
that you shall blot out the memory of Amalek from under the sky; you shall
not forget.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,1);</script>It shall be, when you
have come in to the land which Yahweh your God gives you for an
inheritance, and possess it, and dwell therein, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,2);</script>that you shall take of the first
of all the fruit of the ground, which you shall bring in from your land
that Yahweh your God gives you; and you shall put it in a basket, and
shall go to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose, to cause his
name to dwell there. <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,3);</script>You
shall come to the priest who shall be in those days, and tell him, “I
profess this day to Yahweh your God, that I am come to the land which
Yahweh swore to our fathers to give us.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,4);</script>The priest shall take the basket
out of your hand, and set it down before the altar of Yahweh your God.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(26,5);</script>You shall answer and say
before Yahweh your God, “A Syrian ready to perish was my father; and he
went down into Egypt, and lived there, few in number; and he became there
a nation, great, mighty, and populous. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,6);</script>The Egyptians dealt ill with us,
and afflicted us, and laid on us hard bondage: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,7);</script>and we cried to Yahweh, the God
of our fathers, and Yahweh heard our voice, and saw our affliction, and
our toil, and our oppression; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,8);</script>and Yahweh brought us forth out
of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great
terror, and with signs, and with wonders; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,9);</script>and he has brought us into this
place, and has given us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(26,10);</script>Now, behold, I have
brought the first of the fruit of the ground, which you, Yahweh, have
given me.” You shall set it down before Yahweh your God, and worship
before Yahweh your God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,11);</script>You shall rejoice in all the
good which Yahweh your God has given to you, and to your house, you, and
the Levite, and the foreigner who is in the midst of you.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,12);</script>When you have made an
end of tithing all the tithe of your increase in the third year, which is
the year of tithing, then you shall give it to the Levite, to the
foreigner, to the fatherless, and to the widow, that they may eat within
your gates, and be filled. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,13);</script>You shall say before Yahweh your
God, “I have put away the holy things out of my house, and also have
given them to the Levite, and to the foreigner, to the fatherless, and to
the widow, according to all your commandment which you have commanded me:
I have not transgressed any of your commandments, neither have I forgotten
them: <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,14);</script>I have not eaten
of it in my mourning, neither have I put away of it, being unclean, nor
given of it for the dead: I have listened to the voice of Yahweh my God; I
have done according to all that you have commanded me. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,15);</script>Look down from your holy
habitation, from heaven, and bless your people Israel, and the ground
which you have given us, as you swore to our fathers, a land flowing with
milk and honey.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,16);</script>This day Yahweh your
God commands you to do these statutes and ordinances: you shall therefore
keep and do them with all your heart, and with all your soul. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,17);</script>You have declared Yahweh this
day to be your God, and that you would walk in his ways, and keep his
statutes, and his commandments, and his ordinances, and listen to his
voice: <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,18);</script>and Yahweh has
declared you this day to be a people for his own possession, as he has
promised you, and that you should keep all his commandments; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,19);</script>and to make you high above all
nations that he has made, in praise, and in name, and in honor; and that
you may be a holy people to Yahweh your God, as he has spoken.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,1);</script>Moses and the elders
of Israel commanded the people, saying, “Keep all the commandment which
I command you this day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,2);</script>It shall be on the day when you
shall pass over the Jordan to the land which Yahweh your God gives you,
that you shall set yourself up great stones, and plaster them with
plaster: <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,3);</script>and you shall
write on them all the words of this law, when you have passed over; that
you may go in to the land which Yahweh your God gives you, a land flowing
with milk and honey, as Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has promised you.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(27,4);</script>It shall be, when you
have passed over the Jordan, that you shall set up these stones, which I
command you this day, in Mount Ebal, and you shall plaster them with
plaster. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,5);</script>There you shall
build an altar to Yahweh your God, an altar of stones: you shall lift up
no iron on them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,6);</script>You
shall build the altar of Yahweh your God of uncut stones; and you shall
offer burnt offerings thereon to Yahweh your God: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,7);</script>and you shall sacrifice peace
offerings, and shall eat there; and you shall rejoice before Yahweh your
God. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,8);</script>You shall write on
the stones all the words of this law very plainly.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,9);</script>Moses and the priests
the Levites spoke to all Israel, saying, “Keep silence, and listen,
Israel: this day you have become the people of Yahweh your God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,10);</script>You shall therefore obey the
voice of Yahweh your God, and do his commandments and his statutes, which
I command you this day.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,11);</script>Moses commanded the
people the same day, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,12);</script>“These shall stand on Mount
Gerizim to bless the people, when you have passed over the Jordan: Simeon,
and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,13);</script>These shall stand on Mount Ebal
for the curse: Reuben, Gad, and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(27,14);</script>The Levites shall
answer, and tell all the men of Israel with a loud voice, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,15);</script>‘Cursed is the man who makes
an engraved or molten image, an abomination to Yahweh, the work of the
hands of the craftsman, and sets it up in secret.’ All the people shall
answer and say, ‘Amen.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,16);</script>‘Cursed is he who sets light
by his father or his mother.’ All the people shall say, ‘Amen.’
<script type="text/javascript">cb(27,17);</script>‘Cursed is he who
removes his neighbor’s landmark.’ All the people shall say,
‘Amen.’ <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,18);</script>‘Cursed is
he who makes the blind to wander out of the way.’ All the people shall
say, ‘Amen.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,19);</script>‘Cursed is he who the
foreigner, fatherless, and widow of justice.’ All the people shall say,
‘Amen.’ <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,20);</script>‘Cursed is
he who lies with his father’s wife, because he has uncovered his
father’s skirt.’ All the people shall say, ‘Amen.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,21);</script>‘Cursed is he who lies with
any kind of animal.’ All the people shall say, ‘Amen.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,22);</script>‘Cursed is he who lies with
his sister, the daughter of his father, or the daughter of his mother.’
All the people shall say, ‘Amen.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,23);</script>‘Cursed is he who lies with
his mother-in-law.’ All the people shall say, ‘Amen.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,24);</script>‘Cursed is he who strikes his
neighbor in secret.’ All the people shall say, ‘Amen.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,25);</script>‘Cursed is he who takes a
bribe to kill an innocent person.’ All the people shall say, ‘Amen.’
<script type="text/javascript">cb(27,26);</script>‘Cursed is he who
doesn’t confirm the words of this law to do them.’ All the people
shall say, ‘Amen.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,1);</script>It shall happen, if
you shall listen diligently to the voice of Yahweh your God, to observe to
do all his commandments which I command you this day, that Yahweh your God
will set you on high above all the nations of the earth: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,2);</script>and all these blessings shall
come on you, and overtake you, if you shall listen to the voice of Yahweh
your God. <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,3);</script>You shall be
blessed in the city, and you shall be blessed in the field. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,4);</script>You shall be blessed in the fruit
of your body, the fruit of your ground, the fruit of your animals, the
increase of your livestock, and the young of your flock. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,5);</script>Your basket and your kneading
trough shall be blessed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,6);</script>You shall be blessed when you
come in, and you shall be blessed when you go out. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,7);</script>Yahweh will cause your enemies
who rise up against you to be struck before you. They will come out
against you one way, and will flee before you seven ways. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,8);</script>Yahweh will command the blessing
on you in your barns, and in all that you put your hand to; and he will
bless you in the land which Yahweh your God gives you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,9);</script>Yahweh will establish you for a
holy people to himself, as he has sworn to you; if you shall keep the
commandments of Yahweh your God, and walk in his ways. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,10);</script>All the peoples of the earth
shall see that you are called by the name of Yahweh; and they shall be
afraid of you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,11);</script>Yahweh
will make you plenteous for good, in the fruit of your body, and in the
fruit of your livestock, and in the fruit of your ground, in the land
which Yahweh swore to your fathers to give you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,12);</script>Yahweh will open to you his good
treasure in the sky, to give the rain of your land in its season, and to
bless all the work of your hand: and you shall lend to many nations, and
you shall not borrow. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,13);</script>Yahweh will make you the head,
and not the tail; and you shall be above only, and you shall not be
beneath; if you shall listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God, which
I command you this day, to observe and to do, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,14);</script>and shall not turn aside from
any of the words which I command you this day, to the right hand, or to
the left, to go after other gods to serve them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,15);</script>But it shall come to pass, if
you will not listen to the voice of Yahweh your God, to observe to do all
his commandments and his statutes which I command you this day, that all
these curses shall come on you, and overtake you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,16);</script>You shall be cursed in the city,
and you shall be cursed in the field. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,17);</script>Your basket and your kneading
trough shall be cursed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,18);</script>The fruit of your body, the
fruit of your ground, the increase of your livestock, and the young of
your flock shall be cursed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,19);</script>You shall be cursed when you
come in, and you shall be cursed when you go out. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,20);</script>Yahweh will send on you cursing,
confusion, and rebuke, in all that you put your hand to do, until you are
destroyed, and until you perish quickly; because of the evil of your
doings, by which you have forsaken me. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,21);</script>Yahweh will make the pestilence
cling to you, until he has consumed you from off the land, where you go in
to possess it. <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,22);</script>Yahweh
will strike you with consumption, and with fever, and with inflammation,
and with fiery heat, and with the sword, and with blight, and with mildew;
and they shall pursue you until you perish. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,23);</script>Your sky that is over your head
shall be brass, and the earth that is under you shall be iron. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,24);</script>Yahweh will make the rain of
your land powder and dust: from the sky shall it come down on you, until
you are destroyed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,25);</script>Yahweh will cause you to be
struck before your enemies; you shall go out one way against them, and
shall flee seven ways before them: and you shall be tossed back and forth
among all the kingdoms of the earth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,26);</script>Your dead body shall be food to
all birds of the sky, and to the animals of the earth; and there shall be
none to frighten them away. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,27);</script>Yahweh will strike you with the
boil of Egypt, and with the tumors, and with the scurvy, and with the
itch, of which you can not be healed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,28);</script>Yahweh will strike you with
madness, and with blindness, and with astonishment of heart; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,29);</script>and you shall grope at noonday,
as the blind gropes in darkness, and you shall not prosper in your ways:
and you shall be only oppressed and robbed always, and there shall be none
to save you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,30);</script>You shall
betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her: you shall build a
house, and you shall not dwell therein: you shall plant a vineyard, and
shall not use its fruit. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,31);</script>Your ox shall be slain before
your eyes, and you shall not eat of it: your donkey shall be violently
taken away from before your face, and shall not be restored to you: your
sheep shall be given to your enemies, and you shall have none to save you.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(28,32);</script>Your sons and your
daughters shall be given to another people; and your eyes shall look, and
fail with longing for them all the day: and there shall be nothing in the
power of your hand. <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,33);</script>The
fruit of your ground, and all your labors, shall a nation which you
don’t know eat up; and you shall be only oppressed and crushed always;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(28,34);</script>so that you shall be mad
for the sight of your eyes which you shall see. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,35);</script>Yahweh will strike you in the
knees, and in the legs, with a sore boil, of which you can not be healed,
from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,36);</script>Yahweh will bring you, and your
king whom you shall set over you, to a nation that you have not known, you
nor your fathers; and there you shall serve other gods, wood and stone.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(28,37);</script>You shall become an
astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, among all the peoples where Yahweh
shall lead you away. <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,38);</script>You
shall carry much seed out into the field, and shall gather little in; for
the locust shall consume it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,39);</script>You shall plant vineyards and
dress them, but you shall neither drink of the wine, nor harvest; for the
worm shall eat them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,40);</script>You
shall have olive trees throughout all your borders, but you shall not
anoint yourself with the oil; for your olives shall drop off. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,41);</script>You shall father sons and
daughters, but they shall not be yours; for they shall go into captivity.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(28,42);</script>All your trees and the
fruit of your ground shall the locust possess. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,43);</script>The foreigner who is in the
midst of you shall mount up above you higher and higher; and you shall
come down lower and lower. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,44);</script>He shall lend to you, and you
shall not lend to him: he shall be the head, and you shall be the tail.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(28,45);</script>All these curses shall
come on you, and shall pursue you, and overtake you, until you are
destroyed; because you didn’t listen to the voice of Yahweh your God, to
keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded you: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,46);</script>and they shall be on you for a
sign and for a wonder, and on your seed forever. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,47);</script>Because you didn’t serve
Yahweh your God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, by reason of
the abundance of all things; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,48);</script>therefore you shall serve your
enemies whom Yahweh shall send against you, in hunger, and in thirst, and
in nakedness, and in want of all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron
on your neck, until he has destroyed you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,49);</script>Yahweh will bring a nation
against you from far, from the end of the earth, as the eagle flies; a
nation whose language you shall not understand; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,50);</script>a nation of fierce facial
expressions, that shall not respect the person of the old, nor show favor
to the young, <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,51);</script>and shall
eat the fruit of your livestock, and the fruit of your ground, until you
are destroyed; that also shall not leave you grain, new wine, or oil, the
increase of your livestock, or the young of your flock, until they have
caused you to perish. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,52);</script>They shall besiege you in all
your gates, until your high and fortified walls come down, in which you
trusted, throughout all your land; and they shall besiege you in all your
gates throughout all your land, which Yahweh your God has given you.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(28,53);</script>You shall eat the fruit
of your own body, the flesh of your sons and of your daughters, whom
Yahweh your God has given you, in the siege and in the distress with which
your enemies shall distress you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,54);</script>The man who is tender among you,
and very delicate, his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward
the wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children whom he has
remaining; <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,55);</script>so that he
will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall
eat, because he has nothing left him, in the siege and in the distress
with which your enemy shall distress you in all your gates. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,56);</script>The tender and delicate woman
among you, who would not adventure to set the sole of her foot on the
ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the
husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,57);</script>and toward her young one who
comes out from between her feet, and toward her children whom she shall
bear; for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly, in the siege
and in the distress with which your enemy shall distress you in your
gates. <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,58);</script>If you will not
observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book,
that you may fear this glorious and fearful name, YAHWEH YOUR GOD; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,59);</script>then Yahweh will make your
plagues wonderful, and the plagues of your seed, even great plagues, and
of long continuance, and severe sicknesses, and of long continuance.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(28,60);</script>He will bring on you
again all the diseases of Egypt, which you were afraid of; and they shall
cling to you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,61);</script>Also every
sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the book of this law,
Yahweh will bring them on you, until you are destroyed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,62);</script>You shall be left few in number,
whereas you were as the stars of the sky for multitude; because you
didn’t listen to the voice of Yahweh your God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,63);</script>It shall happen that as Yahweh
rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you, so Yahweh will
rejoice over you to cause you to perish, and to destroy you; and you shall
be plucked from off the land where you go in to possess it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,64);</script>Yahweh will scatter you among
all peoples, from the one end of the earth even to the other end of the
earth; and there you shall serve other gods, which you have not known, you
nor your fathers, even wood and stone. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,65);</script>Among these nations you shall
find no ease, and there shall be no rest for the sole of your foot: but
Yahweh will give you there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and
pining of soul; <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,66);</script>and your
life shall hang in doubt before you; and you shall fear night and day, and
shall have no assurance of your life. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,67);</script>In the morning you shall say,
“I wish it were evening!” and at evening you shall say, “I wish it
were morning!” for the fear of your heart which you shall fear, and for
the sight of your eyes which you shall see. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,68);</script>Yahweh will bring you into Egypt
again with ships, by the way of which I said to you, You shall see it no
more again: and there you shall sell yourselves to your enemies for
bondservants and for bondmaids, and no man shall buy you.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,1);</script>These are the words of
the covenant which Yahweh commanded Moses to make with the children of
Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant which he made with them
in Horeb. <script type="text/javascript">cb(29,2);</script>Moses called to
all Israel, and said to them, You have seen all that Yahweh did before
your eyes in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to
all his land; <script type="text/javascript">cb(29,3);</script>the great
trials which your eyes saw, the signs, and those great wonders: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,4);</script>but Yahweh has not given you a
heart to know, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, to this day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,5);</script>I have led you forty years in the
wilderness: your clothes have not grown old on you, and your shoes have
not grown old on your feet. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,6);</script>You have not eaten bread, neither
have you drunk wine or strong drink; that you may know that I am Yahweh
your God. <script type="text/javascript">cb(29,7);</script>When you came
to this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came
out against us to battle, and we struck them: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,8);</script>and we took their land, and gave
it for an inheritance to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the
half-tribe of the Manassites. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,9);</script>Keep therefore the words of this
covenant, and do them, that you may prosper in all that you do. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,10);</script>You stand this day all of you
before Yahweh your God; your heads, your tribes, your elders, and your
officers, even all the men of Israel, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,11);</script>your little ones, your wives,
and your foreigner who is in the midst of your camps, from the one who
cuts your wood to the one who draws your water; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,12);</script>that you may enter into the
covenant of Yahweh your God, and into his oath, which Yahweh your God
makes with you this day; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,13);</script>that he may establish you this
day to himself for a people, and that he may be to you a God, as he spoke
to you, and as he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to
Jacob. <script type="text/javascript">cb(29,14);</script>Neither with you
only do I make this covenant and this oath, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,15);</script>but with him who stands here
with us this day before Yahweh our God, and also with him who is not here
with us this day <script type="text/javascript">cb(29,16);</script>(for
you know how we lived in the land of Egypt, and how we came through the
midst of the nations through which you passed; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,17);</script>and you have seen their
abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were
among them); <script type="text/javascript">cb(29,18);</script>lest there
should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turns
away this day from Yahweh our God, to go to serve the gods of those
nations; lest there should be among you a root that bears gall and
wormwood; <script type="text/javascript">cb(29,19);</script>and it happen,
when he hears the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart,
saying, “I shall have peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of my
heart, to destroy the moist with the dry.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,20);</script>Yahweh will not pardon him, but
then the anger of Yahweh and his jealousy will smoke against that man, and
all the curse that is written in this book shall lie on him, and Yahweh
will blot out his name from under the sky. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,21);</script>Yahweh will set him apart to
evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the
covenant that is written in this book of the law.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,22);</script>The generation to
come, your children who shall rise up after you, and the foreigner who
shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that
land, and the sicknesses with which Yahweh has made it sick; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,23);</script>and that the whole land of it is
sulfur, salt, and burning, that it is not sown, nor bears, nor any grass
grows therein, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and
Zeboiim, which Yahweh overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,24);</script>even all the nations shall say,
“Why has Yahweh done thus to this land? What does the heat of this great
anger mean?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,25);</script>Then men shall say,
“Because they forsook the covenant of Yahweh, the God of their fathers,
which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of
Egypt, <script type="text/javascript">cb(29,26);</script>and went and
served other gods, and worshiped them, gods that they didn’t know, and
that he had not given to them: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,27);</script>therefore the anger of Yahweh
was kindled against this land, to bring on it all the curse that is
written in this book; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,28);</script>and Yahweh rooted them out of
their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them
into another land, as at this day.”
<p>	 <script type="text/javascript">cb(29,29);</script>The secret things
belong to Yahweh our God; but the things that are revealed belong to us
and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this law.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,1);</script>It shall happen, when
all these things have come on you, the blessing and the curse, which I
have set before you, and you shall call them to mind among all the
nations, where Yahweh your God has driven you, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,2);</script>and shall return to Yahweh your
God, and shall obey his voice according to all that I command you this
day, you and your children, with all your heart, and with all your soul;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(30,3);</script>that then Yahweh your God
will turn your captivity, and have compassion on you, and will return and
gather you from all the peoples, where Yahweh your God has scattered you.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(30,4);</script>If your outcasts are in
the uttermost parts of the heavens, from there will Yahweh your God gather
you, and from there he will bring you back: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,5);</script>and Yahweh your God will bring
you into the land which your fathers possessed, and you shall possess it;
and he will do you good, and multiply you above your fathers. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,6);</script>Yahweh your God will circumcise
your heart, and the heart of your seed, to love Yahweh your God with all
your heart, and with all your soul, that you may live. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,7);</script>Yahweh your God will put all
these curses on your enemies, and on those who hate you, who persecuted
you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(30,8);</script>You shall return and
obey the voice of Yahweh, and do all his commandments which I command you
this day. <script type="text/javascript">cb(30,9);</script>Yahweh your God
will make you plenteous in all the work of your hand, in the fruit of your
body, and in the fruit of your livestock, and in the fruit of your ground,
for good: for Yahweh will again rejoice over you for good, as he rejoiced
over your fathers; <script type="text/javascript">cb(30,10);</script>if
you shall obey the voice of Yahweh your God, to keep his commandments and
his statutes which are written in this book of the law; if you turn to
Yahweh your God with all your heart, and with all your soul.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,11);</script>For this commandment
which I command you this day, it is not too hard for you, neither is it
far off. <script type="text/javascript">cb(30,12);</script>It is not in
heaven, that you should say, “Who shall go up for us to heaven, and
bring it to us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,13);</script>Neither is it beyond the sea,
that you should say, “Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it to
us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,14);</script>But the word is very near to
you, in your mouth, and in your heart, that you may do it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,15);</script>Behold, I have set before you
this day life and good, and death and evil; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,16);</script>in that I command you this day
to love Yahweh your God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments
and his statutes and his ordinances, that you may live and multiply, and
that Yahweh your God may bless you in the land where you go in to possess
it. <script type="text/javascript">cb(30,17);</script>But if your heart
turns away, and you will not hear, but shall be drawn away, and worship
other gods, and serve them; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,18);</script>I denounce to you this day, that
you shall surely perish; you shall not prolong your days in the land,
where you pass over the Jordan to go in to possess it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,19);</script>I call heaven and earth to
witness against you this day, that I have set before you life and death,
the blessing and the curse: therefore choose life, that you may live, you
and your seed; <script type="text/javascript">cb(30,20);</script>to love
Yahweh your God, to obey his voice, and to cling to him; for he is your
life, and the length of your days; that you may dwell in the land which
Yahweh swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give
them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,1);</script>Moses went and spoke
these words to all Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,2);</script>He said to them, “I am one
hundred twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in: and
Yahweh has said to me, ‘You shall not go over this Jordan.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,3);</script>Yahweh your God, he will go over
before you; he will destroy these nations from before you, and you shall
dispossess them. Joshua shall go over before you, as Yahweh has spoken.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(31,4);</script>Yahweh will do to them as
he did to Sihon and to Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their land;
whom he destroyed. <script type="text/javascript">cb(31,5);</script>Yahweh
will deliver them up before you, and you shall do to them according to all
the commandment which I have commanded you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,6);</script>Be strong and courageous, don’t
be afraid, nor be scared of them: for Yahweh your God, he it is who does
go with you; he will not fail you, nor forsake you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,7);</script>Moses called to
Joshua, and said to him in the sight of all Israel, “Be strong and
courageous: for you shall go with this people into the land which Yahweh
has sworn to their fathers to give them; and you shall cause them to
inherit it. <script type="text/javascript">cb(31,8);</script>Yahweh, he it
is who does go before you; he will be with you, he will not fail you,
neither forsake you: don’t be afraid, neither be dismayed.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,9);</script>Moses wrote this law,
and delivered it to the priests the sons of Levi, who bore the ark of the
covenant of Yahweh, and to all the elders of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,10);</script>Moses commanded them, saying,
“At the end of every seven years, in the set time of the year of
release, in the feast of tents, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,11);</script>when all Israel has come to
appear before Yahweh your God in the place which he shall choose, you
shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,12);</script>Assemble the people, the men and
the women and the little ones, and your foreigner who is within your
gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear Yahweh your
God, and observe to do all the words of this law; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,13);</script>and that their children, who
have not known, may hear, and learn to fear Yahweh your God, as long as
you live in the land where you go over the Jordan to possess it.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,14);</script>Yahweh said to Moses,
“Behold, your days approach that you must die: call Joshua, and present
yourselves in the Tent of Meeting, that I may commission him.” Moses and
Joshua went, and presented themselves in the Tent of Meeting.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,15);</script>Yahweh appeared in
the Tent in a pillar of cloud: and the pillar of cloud stood over the door
of the Tent. <script type="text/javascript">cb(31,16);</script>Yahweh said
to Moses, “Behold, you shall sleep with your fathers; and this people
will rise up, and play the prostitute after the strange gods of the land,
where they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant
which I have made with them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,17);</script>Then my anger shall be kindled
against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face
from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall
come on them; so that they will say in that day, ‘Haven’t these evils
come on us because our God is not among us?’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,18);</script>I will surely hide my face in
that day for all the evil which they shall have worked, in that they are
turned to other gods.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,19);</script>“Now therefore
write this song for yourselves, and teach it to the children of Israel:
put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the
children of Israel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(31,20);</script>For
when I shall have brought them into the land which I swore to their
fathers, flowing with milk and honey, and they shall have eaten and filled
themselves, and grown fat; then will they turn to other gods, and serve
them, and despise me, and break my covenant. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,21);</script>It shall happen, when many evils
and troubles have come on them, that this song shall testify before them
as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their
seed: for I know their imagination which they frame this day, before I
have brought them into the land which I swore.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,22);</script>So Moses wrote this song the
same day, and taught it the children of Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,23);</script>He commissioned
Joshua the son of Nun, and said, “Be strong and courageous; for you
shall bring the children of Israel into the land which I swore to them:
and I will be with you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,24);</script>It happened, when
Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until
they were finished, <script type="text/javascript">cb(31,25);</script>that
Moses commanded the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh,
saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(31,26);</script>“Take this
book of the law, and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant of
Yahweh your God, that it may be there for a witness against you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,27);</script>For I know your rebellion, and
your stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, you have
been rebellious against Yahweh; and how much more after my death? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,28);</script>Assemble to me all the elders of
your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their
ears, and call heaven and earth to witness against them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,29);</script>For I know that after my death
you will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I
have commanded you; and evil will happen to you in the latter days;
because you will do that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke
him to anger through the work of your hands.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,30);</script>Moses spoke in the
ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, until they were
finished.
<p>
<dl>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,1);</script>Give ear, you
heavens, and I will speak.
<dd>Let the earth hear the words of my mouth.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,2);</script>My doctrine shall
drop as the rain.
<dd>My speech shall condense as the dew,
<dd>as the small rain on the tender grass,
<dd>as the showers on the herb.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,3);</script>For I will proclaim
the name of Yahweh.
<dd>Ascribe greatness to our God!
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,4);</script>The Rock, his work is
perfect,
<dd>for all his ways are justice:
<dd>a God of faithfulness and without iniquity,
<dd>just and right is he.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,5);</script>They have dealt
corruptly with him. They are not his children, because of their defect.
<dd>They are a perverse and crooked generation.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,6);</script>Do you thus requite
Yahweh,
<dd>foolish people and unwise?
<dt>Isn’t he your father who has bought you?
<dd>He has made you, and established you.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,7);</script>Remember the days of
old.
<dd>Consider the years of many generations.
<dt>Ask your father, and he will show you;
<dd>your elders, and they will tell you.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,8);</script>When the Most High
gave to the nations their inheritance,
<dd>when he separated the children of men,
<dt>he set the bounds of the peoples
<dd>according to the number of the children of Israel.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,9);</script>For Yahweh’s
portion is his people.
<dd>Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,10);</script>He found him in a
desert land,
<dd>in the waste howling wilderness.
<dt>He surrounded him.
<dd>He cared for him.
<dd>He kept him as the apple of his eye.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,11);</script>As an eagle that
stirs up her nest,
<dd>that flutters over her young,
<dt>he spread abroad his wings, he took them,

<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,12);</script>Yahweh alone led him.
<dd>There was no foreign god with him.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,13);</script>He made him ride on
the high places of the earth.
<dd>He ate the increase of the field.
<dt>He caused him to suck honey out of the rock,
<dd>oil out of the flinty rock;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,14);</script>Butter of the herd,
and milk of the flock,
<dd>with fat of lambs,
<dd>rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats,
<dd>with the finest of the wheat.
<dd>Of the blood of the grape you drank wine.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,15);</script>But Jeshurun grew
fat, and kicked.
<dd>You have grown fat.
<dd>You have grown thick.
<dd>You have become sleek.
<dt>Then he forsook God who made him,
<dd>and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,16);</script>They moved him to
jealousy with strange gods.
<dd>They provoked him to anger with abominations.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,17);</script>They sacrificed to
demons, not God,
<dd>to gods that they didn’t know,
<dd>to new gods that came up recently,
<dd>which your fathers didn’t dread.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,18);</script>Of the Rock who
became your father, you are unmindful,
<dd>and have forgotten God who gave you birth.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,19);</script>Yahweh saw and
abhorred,
<dd>because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,20);</script>He said, “I will
hide my face from them.
<dd>I will see what their end shall be;
<dt>for they are a very perverse generation,
<dd>children in whom is no faithfulness.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,21);</script>They have moved me
to jealousy with that which is not God.
<dd>They have provoked me to anger with their vanities.
<dt>I will move them to jealousy with those who are not a people.
<dd>I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,22);</script>For a fire is
kindled in my anger,
<dd>Burns to the lowest <a href="#N8">Sheol</a>,
<dd>Devours the earth with its increase,

<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,23);</script>“I will heap evils
on them.
<dd>I will spend my arrows on them.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,24);</script>They shall be wasted
with hunger, and devoured with burning heat
<dd>and bitter destruction.
<dt>I will send the teeth of animals on them,
<dd>With the poison of crawling things of the dust.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,25);</script>Outside the sword
shall bereave,
<dd>and in the rooms, terror;
<dt>on both young man and virgin,
<dd>The nursing infant with the gray-haired man.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,26);</script>I said, I would
scatter them afar.
<dd>I would make their memory to cease from among men;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,27);</script>were it not that I
feared the provocation of the enemy,
<dd>lest their adversaries should judge wrongly,
<dd>lest they should say, ‘Our hand is exalted,
<dd>Yahweh has not done all this.’”
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,28);</script>For they are a
nation void of counsel.
<dd>There is no understanding in them.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,29);</script>Oh that they were
wise, that they understood this,
<dd>that they would consider their latter end!
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,30);</script>How could one chase
a thousand,
<dd>and two put ten thousand to flight,
<dt>unless their Rock had sold them,
<dd>and Yahweh had delivered them up?
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,31);</script>For their rock is
not as our Rock,
<dd>even our enemies themselves being judges.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,32);</script>For their vine is of
the vine of Sodom,
<dd>of the fields of Gomorrah.
<dt>Their grapes are grapes of gall,
<dd>Their clusters are bitter.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,33);</script>Their wine is the
poison of serpents,
<dd>The cruel venom of asps.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,34);</script>“Isn’t this laid
up in store with me,
<dd>sealed up among my treasures?
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,35);</script>Vengeance is mine,
and recompense,
<dd>at the time when their foot slides;
<dt>for the day of their calamity is at hand.
<dd>The things that are to come on them shall make haste.”
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,36);</script>For Yahweh will
judge his people,
<dd>and have compassion on his servants,
<dt>when he sees that their power is gone,
<dd>There is none remaining, shut up or left at large.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,37);</script>He will say,
“Where are their gods,
<dd>The rock in which they took refuge;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,38);</script>Which ate the fat of
their sacrifices,
<dd>And drank the wine of their drink offering?
<dt>Let them rise up and help you!

<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,39);</script>“See now that I,
even I, am he,

<dd>There is no one who can deliver out of my hand.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,40);</script>For I lift up my
hand to heaven,
<dd>And say, As I live forever,
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,41);</script>if I whet my
glittering sword,
<dd>My hand take hold on judgment;
<dt>I will render vengeance to my adversaries,
<dd>and will recompense those who hate me.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,42);</script>I will make my
arrows drunk with blood.
<dd>My sword shall devour flesh with the blood of the slain and the
captives,

<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,43);</script>Rejoice, you
nations, with his people,

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,44);</script>Moses came and spoke
all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he and Joshua the
son of Nun. <script type="text/javascript">cb(32,45);</script>Moses made
an end of speaking all these words to all Israel; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(32,46);</script>He said to them, “Set your
heart to all the words which I testify to you this day, which you shall
command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(32,47);</script>For it is no vain thing for you;
because it is your life, and through this thing you shall prolong your
days in the land, where you go over the Jordan to possess it.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,48);</script>Yahweh spoke to Moses
that same day, saying, <script

Abarim, to Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against
Jericho; and see the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of
Israel for a possession; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(32,50);</script>and die on the mountain where
you go up, and be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother died on
Mount Hor, and was gathered to his people: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(32,51);</script>because you trespassed against
me in the midst of the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah of
Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because you didn’t sanctify me in the
midst of the children of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(32,52);</script>For you shall see the land
before you; but you shall not go there into the land which I give the
children of Israel.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,1);</script>This is the blessing,
with which Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his
death. <script type="text/javascript">cb(33,2);</script>He said,
<dl>
<dt>“Yahweh came from Sinai,
<dd>And rose from Seir to them.
<dt>He shone forth from Mount Paran.
<dd>He came from the ten thousands of holy ones.
<dd>At his right hand was a fiery law for them.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,3);</script>Yes, he loves the
people.
<dd>All his saints are in your hand.
<dd>They sat down at your feet;

<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,4);</script>Moses commanded us a
law,
<dd>An inheritance for the assembly of Jacob.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,5);</script>He was king in
Jeshurun,
<dd>When the heads of the people were gathered,
<dd>All the tribes of Israel together.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,6);</script>“Let Reuben live,
and not die;
<dd>Nor let his men be few.”
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,7);</script>This is for Judah. He
said,
<dl>
<dt>“Hear, Yahweh, the voice of Judah.
<dd>Bring him in to his people.
<dt>With his hands he contended for himself.
<dd>You shall be a help against his adversaries.”
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,8);</script>Of Levi he said,
<dl>
<dt>“Your Thummim and your Urim are with your godly one,
<dd>whom you proved at Massah,
<dd>with whom you strove at the waters of Meribah;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,9);</script>who said of his
father, and of his mother, ‘I have not seen him;’
<dd>Neither did he acknowledge his brothers,
<dd>Nor did he know his own children:
<dt>For they have observed your word,
<dd>and keep your covenant.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,10);</script>They shall teach
Jacob your ordinances,
<dd>and Israel your law.
<dt>They shall put incense before you,

<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,11);</script>Yahweh, bless his
substance.
<dd>Accept the work of his hands.
<dt>Strike through the hips of those who rise up against him,
<dd>of those who hate him, that they not rise again.”
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,12);</script>Of Benjamin he said,
<dl>
<dt>“The beloved of Yahweh shall dwell in safety by him.
<dd>He covers him all the day long.
<dd>He dwells between his shoulders.”
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,13);</script>Of Joseph he said,
<dl>
<dt>“His land is blessed by Yahweh,
<dd>for the precious things of the heavens, for the dew,
<dd>for the deep that couches beneath,
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,14);</script>for the precious
things of the fruits of the sun,
<dd>for the precious things of the growth of the moons,
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,15);</script>for the chief things
of the ancient mountains,
<dd>for the precious things of the everlasting hills,
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,16);</script>for the precious
things of the earth and its fullness,
<dd>the good will of him who lived in the <a href="#N9">bush</a>.
<dt>Let this come on the head of Joseph,
<dd>on the crown of the head of him who was separate from his brothers.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,17);</script>The firstborn of his
herd, majesty is his.
<dd>His horns are the horns of the wild ox.
<dd>With them he shall push all of the peoples, to the ends of the earth:
<dt>They are the ten thousands of Ephraim.
<dd>They are the thousands of Manasseh.”
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,18);</script>Of Zebulun he said,
<dl>
<dt>“Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out;
<dd>and Issachar, in your tents.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,19);</script>They shall call the
peoples to the mountain.
<dd>There they will offer sacrifices of righteousness,
<dt>for they shall draw out the abundance of the seas,
<dd>the hidden treasures of the sand.”
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,20);</script>Of Gad he said,
<dl>
<dt>“He who enlarges Gad is blessed.
<dd>He dwells as a lioness,
<dd>and tears the arm, yes, the crown of the head.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,21);</script>He provided the
first part for himself,
<dd>for there was the lawgiver’s portion reserved.
<dt>He came with the heads of the people.
<dd>He executed the righteousness of Yahweh,
<dd>His ordinances with Israel.”
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,22);</script>Of Dan he said,
<dl>
<dt>“Dan is a lion’s cub
<dd>that leaps out of Bashan.”
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,23);</script>Of Naphtali he said,
<dl>
<dt>“Naphtali, satisfied with favor,
<dd>full of the blessing of Yahweh,
<dd>Possess the west and the south.”
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,24);</script>Of Asher he said,
<dl>
<dt>“Asher is blessed with children.
<dd>Let him be acceptable to his brothers.
<dd>Let him dip his foot in oil.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,25);</script>Your bars shall be
iron and brass.

<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,26);</script>“There is none

<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,27);</script>The eternal God is
your dwelling place.
<dd>Underneath are the everlasting arms.
<dt>He thrust out the enemy from before you,
<dd>and said, ‘Destroy!’
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,28);</script>Israel dwells in
safety;
<dd>the fountain of Jacob alone,
<dt>In a land of grain and new wine.
<dd>Yes, his heavens drop down dew.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,29);</script>You are happy,
Israel.
<dd>Who is like you, a people saved by Yahweh,
<dd>the shield of your help,
<dd>the sword of your excellency!
<dt>Your enemies shall submit themselves to you.
<dd>You shall tread on their high places.”
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,1);</script>Moses went up from the
plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against
Jericho. Yahweh showed him all the land of Gilead, to Dan, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(34,2);</script>and all Naphtali, and the land of
Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, to the hinder sea,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(34,3);</script>and the South, and the
Plain of the valley of Jericho the city of palm trees, to Zoar. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(34,4);</script>Yahweh said to him, “This is
the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, ‘I
will give it to your seed.’ I have caused you to see it with your eyes,
but you shall not go over there.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,5);</script>So Moses the servant
of Yahweh died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of Yahweh.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(34,6);</script>He buried him in the
valley in the land of Moab over against Beth Peor: but no man knows of his
tomb to this day. <script type="text/javascript">cb(34,7);</script>Moses
was one hundred twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor
his natural force abated. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(34,8);</script>The children of Israel wept for
Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping in the
mourning for Moses were ended. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(34,9);</script>Joshua the son of Nun was full of
the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands on him: and the
children of Israel listened to him, and did as Yahweh commanded Moses.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(34,10);</script>There has not arisen a
prophet since in Israel like Moses, whom Yahweh knew face to face, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(34,11);</script>in all the signs and the
wonders, which Yahweh sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and
to all his servants, and to all his land, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(34,12);</script>and in all the mighty hand, and
in all the great terror, which Moses worked in the sight of all Israel.
