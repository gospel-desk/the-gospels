Genesis
</h1><p>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,1);</script>In the beginning <a
href="#N1">God</a> created the heavens and the earth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,2);</script>Now the earth was formless and
empty. Darkness was on the surface of the deep. God’s Spirit was
hovering over the surface of the waters.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,3);</script>God said, “Let there
be light,” and there was light. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,4);</script>God saw the light, and saw that it
was good. God divided the light from the darkness. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,5);</script>God called the light “day,”
and the darkness he called “night.” There was evening and there was
morning, one day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,6);</script>God said, “Let there
be an expanse in the middle of the waters, and let it divide the waters
from the waters.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,7);</script>God
made the expanse, and divided the waters which were under the expanse from
the waters which were above the expanse; and it was so. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,8);</script>God called the expanse “sky.”
There was evening and there was morning, a second day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,9);</script>God said, “Let the
waters under the sky be gathered together to one place, and let the dry
land appear”; and it was so. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,10);</script>God called the dry land
“earth,” and the gathering together of the waters he called
“seas.” God saw that it was good. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,11);</script>God said, “Let the earth yield
grass, herbs yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit after their
kind, with its seed in it, on the earth”; and it was so. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,12);</script>The earth yielded grass, herbs
yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, with its seed in
it, after their kind; and God saw that it was good. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,13);</script>There was evening and there was
morning, a third day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,14);</script>God said, “Let there
be lights in the expanse of sky to divide the day from the night; and let
them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,15);</script>and let them be for lights in the
expanse of sky to give light on the earth”; and it was so. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,16);</script>God made the two great lights:
the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night.
He also made the stars. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,17);</script>God set them in the expanse of
sky to give light to the earth, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,18);</script>and to rule over the day and over
the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. God saw that it was
good. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,19);</script>There was evening
and there was morning, a fourth day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,20);</script>God said, “Let the
waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the
earth in the open expanse of sky.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,21);</script>God created the large sea
creatures, and every living creature that moves, with which the waters
swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind. God saw
that it was good. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,22);</script>God
blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in
the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,23);</script>There was evening and there was
morning, a fifth day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,24);</script>God said, “Let the
earth produce living creatures after their kind, livestock, creeping
things, and animals of the earth after their kind”; and it was so.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,25);</script>God made the animals of
the earth after their kind, and the livestock after their kind, and
everything that creeps on the ground after its kind. God saw that it was
good.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,26);</script>God said, “Let us
make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over
the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the sky, and over the
livestock, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that
creeps on the earth.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,27);</script>God created man in his own image.
In God’s image he created him; male and female he created them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,28);</script>God blessed them. God said to
them, “Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it. Have
dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the sky, and over
every living thing that moves on the earth.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,29);</script>God said, “Behold, I have given
you every herb yielding seed, which is on the surface of all the earth,
and every tree, which bears fruit yielding seed. It will be your food.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,30);</script>To every animal of the
earth, and to every bird of the sky, and to everything that creeps on the
earth, in which there is life, I have given every green herb for food”;
and it was so.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,31);</script>God saw everything
that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. There was evening and
there was morning, a sixth day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,1);</script>The heavens and the
earth were finished, and all their vast array. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,2);</script>On the seventh day God finished
his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his
work which he had made. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,3);</script>God blessed the seventh day, and
made it holy, because he rested in it from all his work which he had
created and made.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,4);</script>This is the history of
the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in
the day that <a href="#N2">Yahweh</a> God made the earth and the heavens.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,5);</script>No plant of the field was
yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for Yahweh
God had not caused it to rain on the earth. There was not a man to till
the ground, <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,6);</script>but a mist
went up from the earth, and watered the whole surface of the ground.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,7);</script>Yahweh God formed man from
the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life;
and man became a living soul. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,8);</script>Yahweh God planted a garden
eastward, in Eden, and there he put the man whom he had formed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,9);</script>Out of the ground Yahweh God made
every tree to grow that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the
tree of life also in the middle of the garden, and the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,10);</script>A river went out of Eden to water
the garden; and from there it was parted, and became four heads. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,11);</script>The name of the first is Pishon:
this is the one which flows through the whole land of Havilah, where there
is gold; <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,12);</script>and the gold of
that land is good. There is aromatic resin and the onyx stone. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,13);</script>The name of the second river is
Gihon: the same river that flows through the whole land of Cush. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,14);</script>The name of the third river is
Hiddekel: this is the one which flows in front of Assyria. The fourth
river is the Euphrates. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,15);</script>Yahweh God took the man, and put
him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,16);</script>Yahweh God commanded the man,
saying, “Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,17);</script>but of the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil, you shall not eat of it; for in the day that you eat of
it you will surely die.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,18);</script>Yahweh God said, “It
is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper
suitable for him.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,19);</script>Out
of the ground Yahweh God formed every animal of the field, and every bird
of the sky, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them.
Whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,20);</script>The man gave names to all
livestock, and to the birds of the sky, and to every animal of the field;
but for man there was not found a helper suitable for him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,21);</script>Yahweh God caused a deep sleep to
fall on the man, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up
the flesh in its place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,22);</script>He made the rib, which Yahweh God
had taken from the man, into a woman, and brought her to the man. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,23);</script>The man said, “This is now bone
of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. She will be called ‘woman,’
because she was taken out of Man.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,24);</script>Therefore a man will leave his
father and his mother, and will join with his wife, and they will be one
flesh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,25);</script>They were both
naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,1);</script>Now the serpent was
more subtle than any animal of the field which Yahweh God had made. He
said to the woman, “Has God really said, ‘You shall not eat of any
tree of the garden?’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,2);</script>The woman said to the
serpent, “Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,3);</script>but of the fruit of the tree which
is in the middle of the garden, God has said, ‘You shall not eat of it,
neither shall you touch it, lest you die.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,4);</script>The serpent said to the
woman, “You won’t surely die, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,5);</script>for God knows that in the day you
eat it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good
and evil.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,6);</script>When the woman saw that
the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and
that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit,
and ate; and she gave some to her husband with her, and he ate. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,7);</script>The eyes of both of them were
opened, and they knew that they were naked. They sewed fig leaves
together, and made themselves aprons. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,8);</script>They heard the voice of Yahweh God
walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid
themselves from the presence of Yahweh God among the trees of the garden.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,9);</script>Yahweh God called to
the man, and said to him, “Where are you?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,10);</script>The man said, “I
heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and
I hid myself.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,11);</script>God said, “Who told
you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you
not to eat from?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,12);</script>The man said, “The
woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,13);</script>Yahweh God said to the
woman, “What is this you have done?”
<p>The woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,14);</script>Yahweh God said to the
serpent,
<dl>
<dt>“Because you have done this,
<dd>you are cursed above all livestock,
<dd>and above every animal of the field.
<dt>On your belly you shall go,
<dd>and you shall eat dust all the days of your life.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,15);</script>I will put enmity
between you and the woman,
<dd>and between your offspring and her offspring.
<dt>He will bruise your head,
<dd>and you will bruise his heel.”
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,16);</script>To the woman he said,
<dl>
<dt>“I will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth.
<dd>In pain you will bear children.
<dt>Your desire will be for your husband,
<dd>and he will rule over you.”
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,17);</script>To Adam he said,
<dl>
<dt>“Because you have listened to your wife’s voice,
<dd>and have eaten of the tree,
<dd>of which I commanded you, saying, ‘You shall not eat of it,’
<dd>cursed is the ground for your sake.
<dt>In toil you will eat of it all the days of your life.
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,18);</script>It will yield thorns
and thistles to you;
<dd>and you will eat the herb of the field.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,19);</script>By the sweat of your
face will you eat bread until you return to the ground,
<dd>for out of it you were taken.
<dt>For you are dust,
<dd>and to dust you shall return.”
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,20);</script>The man called his
wife Eve, because she was the mother of all living. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,21);</script>Yahweh God made coats of skins
for Adam and for his wife, and clothed them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,22);</script>Yahweh God said,
“Behold, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil. Now,
lest he reach out his hand, and also take of the tree of life, and eat,
and live forever...” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,23);</script>Therefore Yahweh God sent him out
from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,24);</script>So he drove out the man;
and he placed Cherubs at the east of the garden of Eden, and the flame of
a sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,1);</script>The man knew Eve his
wife. She conceived, and gave birth to Cain, and said, “I have gotten a
man with Yahweh’s help.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,2);</script>Again she gave birth, to Cain’s
brother Abel. Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the
ground. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,3);</script>As time passed, it
happened that Cain brought an offering to Yahweh from the fruit of the
ground. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,4);</script>Abel also brought
some of the firstborn of his flock and of its fat. Yahweh respected Abel
and his offering, <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,5);</script>but he
didn’t respect Cain and his offering. Cain was very angry, and the
expression on his face fell. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,6);</script>Yahweh said to Cain, “Why are
you angry? Why has the expression of your face fallen? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,7);</script>If you do well, will it not be
lifted up? If you don’t do well, sin crouches at the door. Its desire is
for you, but you are to rule over it.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,8);</script>Cain said to Abel, his brother,
“Let’s go into the field.” It happened when they were in the field,
that Cain rose up against Abel, his brother, and killed him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,9);</script>Yahweh said to Cain,
“Where is Abel, your brother?”
<p>He said, “I don’t know. Am I my brother’s keeper?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,10);</script>Yahweh said, “What
have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood cries to me from the
ground. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,11);</script>Now you are
cursed because of the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your
brother’s blood from your hand. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,12);</script>From now on, when you till the
ground, it won’t yield its strength to you. You shall be a fugitive and
a wanderer in the earth.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,13);</script>Cain said to Yahweh,
“My punishment is greater than I can bear. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,14);</script>Behold, you have driven me out
this day from the surface of the ground. I will be hidden from your face,
and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth. It will happen that
whoever finds me will kill me.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,15);</script>Yahweh said to him,
“Therefore whoever slays Cain, vengeance will be taken on him
sevenfold.” Yahweh appointed a sign for Cain, lest any finding him
should strike him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,16);</script>Cain went out from
Yahweh’s presence, and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,17);</script>Cain knew his wife. She
conceived, and gave birth to Enoch. He built a city, and called the name
of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,18);</script>To Enoch was born Irad. Irad
became the father of Mehujael. Mehujael became the father of Methushael.
Methushael became the father of Lamech. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,19);</script>Lamech took two wives: the name
of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,20);</script>Adah gave birth to Jabal, who was
the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,21);</script>His brother’s name was Jubal,
who was the father of all who handle the harp and pipe. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,22);</script>Zillah also gave birth to Tubal
Cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron. Tubal
Cain’s sister was Naamah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,23);</script>Lamech said to his wives,
<dl>
<dt>“Adah and Zillah, hear my voice.
<dd>You wives of Lamech, listen to my speech,
<dt>for I have slain a man for wounding me,
<dd>a young man for bruising me.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,24);</script>If Cain will be
avenged seven times,
<dd>truly Lamech seventy-seven times.”
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,25);</script>Adam knew his wife
again. She gave birth to a son, and named him Seth, “for God has
appointed me another child instead of Abel, for Cain killed him.”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,26);</script>There was also born a son
to Seth, and he named him Enosh. Then men began to call on Yahweh’s name.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,1);</script>This is the book of the
generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, he made him in
God’s likeness. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,2);</script>He
created them male and female, and blessed them, and called their name <a
href="#N3">“Adam,”</a> in the day when they were created. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,3);</script>Adam lived one hundred thirty
years, and became the father of a son in his own likeness, after his
image, and named him Seth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,4);</script>The days of Adam after he became
the father of Seth were eight hundred years, and he became the father of
sons and daughters. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,5);</script>All
the days that Adam lived were nine hundred thirty years, then he died.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,6);</script>Seth lived one hundred
five years, and became the father of Enosh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,7);</script>Seth lived after he became the
father of Enosh eight hundred seven years, and became the father of sons
and daughters. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,8);</script>All the
days of Seth were nine hundred twelve years, then he died.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,9);</script>Enosh lived ninety
years, and became the father of Kenan. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,10);</script>Enosh lived after he became the
father of Kenan, eight hundred fifteen years, and became the father of
sons and daughters. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,11);</script>All
the days of Enosh were nine hundred five years, then he died.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,12);</script>Kenan lived seventy
years, and became the father of Mahalalel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,13);</script>Kenan lived after he became the
father of Mahalalel eight hundred forty years, and became the father of
sons and daughters <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,14);</script>and
all the days of Kenan were nine hundred ten years, then he died.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,15);</script>Mahalalel lived
sixty-five years, and became the father of Jared. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,16);</script>Mahalalel lived after he became
the father of Jared eight hundred thirty years, and became the father of
sons and daughters. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,17);</script>All
the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred ninety-five years, then he died.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,18);</script>Jared lived one
hundred sixty-two years, and became the father of Enoch. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,19);</script>Jared lived after he became the
father of Enoch eight hundred years, and became the father of sons and
daughters. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,20);</script>All the days
of Jared were nine hundred sixty-two years, then he died.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,21);</script>Enoch lived sixty-five
years, and became the father of Methuselah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,22);</script>Enoch walked with God after he
became the father of Methuselah three hundred years, and became the father
of sons and daughters. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,23);</script>All the days of Enoch were three
hundred sixty-five years. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,24);</script>Enoch walked with God, and he was
not, for God took him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,25);</script>Methuselah lived one
hundred eighty-seven years, and became the father of Lamech. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,26);</script>Methuselah lived after he became
the father of Lamech seven hundred eighty-two years, and became the father
of sons and daughters. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,27);</script>All the days of Methuselah were
nine hundred sixty-nine years, then he died.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,28);</script>Lamech lived one
hundred eighty-two years, and became the father of a son, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,29);</script>and he named him Noah, saying,
“This same will comfort us in our work and in the toil of our hands,
because of the ground which Yahweh has cursed.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,30);</script>Lamech lived after he became the
father of Noah five hundred ninety-five years, and became the father of
sons and daughters. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,31);</script>All
the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy-seven years, then he died.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,32);</script>Noah was five hundred
years old, and Noah became the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,1);</script>It happened, when men
began to multiply on the surface of the ground, and daughters were born to
them, <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,2);</script>that God’s sons
saw that men’s daughters were beautiful, and they took for themselves
wives of all that they chose. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,3);</script>Yahweh said, “My Spirit will not
strive with man forever, because he also is flesh; yet will his days be
one hundred twenty years.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,4);</script>The Nephilim were in the earth in
those days, and also after that, when God’s sons came in to men’s
daughters. They bore children to them. Those were the mighty men who were
of old, men of renown.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,5);</script>Yahweh saw that the
wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of
the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,6);</script>Yahweh was sorry that he had made
man on the earth, and it grieved him in his heart. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,7);</script>Yahweh said, “I will destroy man
whom I have created from the surface of the ground; man, along with
animals, creeping things, and birds of the sky; for I am sorry that I have
made them.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,8);</script>But Noah
found favor in Yahweh’s eyes.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,9);</script>This is the history of
the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the
people of his time. Noah walked with God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,10);</script>Noah became the father of three
sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,11);</script>The earth was corrupt before God,
and the earth was filled with violence. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,12);</script>God saw the earth, and saw that
it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,13);</script>God said to Noah,
“The end of all flesh has come before me, for the earth is filled with
violence through them. Behold, I will destroy them with the earth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,14);</script>Make a ship of gopher wood. You
shall make rooms in the ship, and shall seal it inside and outside with
pitch. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,15);</script>This is how you
shall make it. The length of the ship will be three hundred cubits, its
breadth fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,16);</script>You shall make a roof in the
ship, and you shall finish it to a cubit upward. You shall set the door of
the ship in its side. You shall make it with lower, second, and third
levels. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,17);</script>I, even I, do
bring the flood of waters on this earth, to destroy all flesh having the
breath of life from under the sky. Everything that is in the earth will
die. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,18);</script>But I will establish
my covenant with you. You shall come into the ship, you, your sons, your
wife, and your sons’ wives with you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,19);</script>Of every living thing of all
flesh, you shall bring two of every sort into the ship, to keep them alive
with you. They shall be male and female. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,20);</script>Of the birds after their kind, of
the livestock after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground
after its kind, two of every sort shall come to you, to keep them alive.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(6,21);</script>Take with you of all food
that is eaten, and gather it to yourself; and it will be for food for you,
and for them.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,22);</script>Thus
Noah did. According to all that God commanded him, so he did.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,1);</script>Yahweh said to Noah,
“Come with all of your household into the ship, for I have seen your
righteousness before me in this generation. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,2);</script>You shall take seven pairs of
every clean animal with you, the male and his female. Of the animals that
are not clean, take two, the male and his female. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,3);</script>Also of the birds of the sky,
seven and seven, male and female, to keep seed alive on the surface of all
the earth. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,4);</script>In seven days,
I will cause it to rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights.
Every living thing that I have made, I will destroy from the surface of
the ground.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,5);</script>Noah did everything
that Yahweh commanded him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,6);</script>Noah was six hundred
years old when the flood of waters came on the earth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,7);</script>Noah went into the ship with his
sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives, because of the waters of the flood.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,8);</script>Clean animals, animals
that are not clean, birds, and everything that creeps on the ground
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,9);</script>went by pairs to Noah into
the ship, male and female, as God commanded Noah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,10);</script>It happened after the seven days,
that the waters of the flood came on the earth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,11);</script>In the six hundredth year of
Noah’s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month,
on the same day all the fountains of the great deep were burst open, and
the sky’s windows were opened. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,12);</script>The rain was on the earth forty
days and forty nights.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,13);</script>In the same day Noah,
and Shem, Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife, and the
three wives of his sons with them, entered into the ship; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,14);</script>they, and every animal after its
kind, all the livestock after their kind, every creeping thing that creeps
on the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, every bird of
every sort. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,15);</script>They went to
Noah into the ship, by pairs of all flesh with the breath of life in them.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,16);</script>Those who went in, went
in male and female of all flesh, as God commanded him; and Yahweh shut him
in. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,17);</script>The flood was forty
days on the earth. The waters increased, and lifted up the ship, and it
was lifted up above the earth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,18);</script>The waters prevailed, and
increased greatly on the earth; and the ship floated on the surface of the
waters. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,19);</script>The waters
prevailed exceedingly on the earth. All the high mountains that were under
the whole sky were covered. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,20);</script>The waters prevailed fifteen
cubits upward, and the mountains were covered. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,21);</script>All flesh died that moved on the
earth, including birds, livestock, animals, every creeping thing that
creeps on the earth, and every man. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,22);</script>All in whose nostrils was the
breath of the spirit of life, of all that was on the dry land, died.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,23);</script>Every living thing was
destroyed that was on the surface of the ground, including man, livestock,
creeping things, and birds of the sky. They were destroyed from the earth.
Only Noah was left, and those who were with him in the ship. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,24);</script>The waters prevailed on the earth
one hundred fifty days.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,1);</script>God remembered Noah,
all the animals, and all the livestock that were with him in the ship; and
God made a wind to pass over the earth. The waters subsided. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,2);</script>The deep’s fountains and the
sky’s windows were also stopped, and the rain from the sky was
restrained. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,3);</script>The waters
receded from the earth continually. After the end of one hundred fifty
days the waters decreased. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,4);</script>The ship rested in the seventh
month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on Ararat’s mountains.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,5);</script>The waters receded
continually until the tenth month. In the tenth month, on the first day of
the month, the tops of the mountains were seen.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,6);</script>It happened at the end
of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ship which he had made,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,7);</script>and he sent out a raven.
It went back and forth, until the waters were dried up from the earth.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,8);</script>He sent out a dove from
him, to see if the waters were abated from the surface of the ground,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,9);</script>but the dove found no
place to rest her foot, and she returned to him into the ship; for the
waters were on the surface of the whole earth. He put out his hand, and
took her, and brought her to him into the ship. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,10);</script>He stayed yet another seven days;
and again he sent the dove out of the ship. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,11);</script>The dove came back to him at
evening, and, behold, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off. So Noah
knew that the waters were abated from the earth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,12);</script>He stayed yet another seven days,
and sent out the dove; and she didn’t return to him any more.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,13);</script>It happened in the six
hundred first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the
waters were dried up from the earth. Noah removed the covering of the
ship, and looked. He saw that the surface of the ground was dried. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,14);</script>In the second month, on the
twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,15);</script>God spoke to Noah,
saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,16);</script>“Go out of the
ship, you, and your wife, and your sons, and your sons’ wives with you.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,17);</script>Bring out with you every
living thing that is with you of all flesh, including birds, livestock,
and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, that they may breed
abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply on the earth.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,18);</script>Noah went out, with
his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives with him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,19);</script>Every animal, every creeping
thing, and every bird, whatever moves on the earth, after their families,
went out of the ship.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,20);</script>Noah built an altar to
Yahweh, and took of every clean animal, and of every clean bird, and
offered burnt offerings on the altar. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,21);</script>Yahweh smelled the pleasant
aroma. Yahweh said in his heart, “I will not again curse the ground any
more for man’s sake, because the imagination of man’s heart is evil
from his youth; neither will I ever again strike everything living, as I
have done. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,22);</script>While the
earth remains, seed time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and
winter, and day and night shall not cease.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,1);</script>God blessed Noah and
his sons, and said to them, “Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish
the earth. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,2);</script>The fear of you
and the dread of you will be on every animal of the earth, and on every
bird of the sky. Everything that the ground teems with, and all the fish
of the sea are delivered into your hand. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,3);</script>Every moving thing that lives will
be food for you. As the green herb, I have given everything to you.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,4);</script>But flesh with its life,
its blood, you shall not eat. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,5);</script>I will surely require your blood
of your lives. At the hand of every animal I will require it. At the hand
of man, even at the hand of every man’s brother, I will require the life
of man. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,6);</script>Whoever sheds
man’s blood, his blood will be shed by man, for God made man in his own
image. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,7);</script>Be fruitful and
multiply. Increase abundantly in the earth, and multiply in it.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,8);</script>God spoke to Noah and
to his sons with him, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,9);</script>“As for me, behold, I establish
my covenant with you, and with your offspring after you, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,10);</script>and with every living creature
that is with you: the birds, the livestock, and every animal of the earth
with you, of all that go out of the ship, even every animal of the earth.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,11);</script>I will establish my
covenant with you: all flesh will not be cut off any more by the waters of
the flood, neither will there ever again be a flood to destroy the
earth.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,12);</script>God said,
“This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and
every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,13);</script>I set my rainbow in the cloud,
and it will be for a sign of a covenant between me and the earth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,14);</script>It will happen, when I bring a
cloud over the earth, that the rainbow will be seen in the cloud, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,15);</script>and I will remember my covenant,
which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh, and
the waters will no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,16);</script>The rainbow will be in the cloud.
I will look at it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between
God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth.”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,17);</script>God said to Noah, “This
is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all
flesh that is on the earth.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,18);</script>The sons of Noah who
went out from the ship were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Ham is the father of
Canaan. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,19);</script>These three were
the sons of Noah, and from these, the whole earth was populated.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,20);</script>Noah began to be a
farmer, and planted a vineyard. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,21);</script>He drank of the wine and got
drunk. He was uncovered within his tent. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,22);</script>Ham, the father of Canaan, saw
the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,23);</script>Shem and Japheth took a garment,
and laid it on both their shoulders, went in backwards, and covered the
nakedness of their father. Their faces were backwards, and they didn’t
see their father’s nakedness. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,24);</script>Noah awoke from his wine, and
knew what his youngest son had done to him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,25);</script>He said,
<dl>
<dt>“Canaan is cursed.
<dd>He will be servant of servants to his brothers.”
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,26);</script>He said,
<dl>
<dt>“Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Shem.
<dd>Let Canaan be his servant.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,27);</script>May God enlarge
Japheth.
<dd>Let him dwell in the tents of Shem.
<dd>Let Canaan be his servant.”
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,28);</script>Noah lived three
hundred fifty years after the flood. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,29);</script>All the days of Noah were nine
hundred fifty years, then he died.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,1);</script>Now this is the
history of the generations of the sons of Noah and of Shem, Ham, and
Japheth. Sons were born to them after the flood.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,2);</script>The sons of Japheth:
Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,3);</script>The sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz,
Riphath, and Togarmah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,4);</script>The sons of Javan: Elishah,
Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,5);</script>Of these were the islands of the
nations divided in their lands, everyone after his language, after their
families, in their nations.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,6);</script>The sons of Ham: Cush,
Mizraim, Put, and Canaan. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,7);</script>The sons of Cush: Seba, Havilah,
Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,8);</script>Cush became the father of Nimrod.
He began to be a mighty one in the earth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,9);</script>He was a mighty hunter before
Yahweh. Therefore it is said, “Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before
Yahweh.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,10);</script>The beginning
of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(10,11);</script>Out of that land he went
into Assyria, and built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,12);</script>and Resen between Nineveh and
Calah (the same is the great city). <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,13);</script>Mizraim became the father of
Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,14);</script>Pathrusim, Casluhim (which the
Philistines descended from), and Caphtorim.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,15);</script>Canaan became the
father of Sidon (his firstborn), Heth, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,16);</script>the Jebusite, the Amorite, the
Girgashite, <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,17);</script>the Hivite,
the Arkite, the Sinite, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,18);</script>the Arvadite, the Zemarite, and
the Hamathite. Afterward the families of the Canaanites were spread
abroad. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,19);</script>The border of
the Canaanites was from Sidon, as you go toward Gerar, to Gaza; as you go
toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, to Lasha. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,20);</script>These are the sons of Ham, after
their families, after their languages, in their lands, in their nations.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,21);</script>To Shem, the father
of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, to him also
were children born. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,22);</script>The
sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,23);</script>The sons of Aram: Uz, Hul,
Gether, and Mash. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,24);</script>Arpachshad became the father of
Shelah. Shelah became the father of Eber. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,25);</script>To Eber were born two sons. The
name of the one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided. His
brother’s name was Joktan. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,26);</script>Joktan became the father of
Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,27);</script>Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,28);</script>Obal, Abimael, Sheba, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,29);</script>Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All
these were the sons of Joktan. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,30);</script>Their dwelling was from Mesha,
as you go toward Sephar, the mountain of the east. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,31);</script>These are the sons of Shem,
after their families, after their languages, in their lands, after their
nations.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,32);</script>These are the
families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations.
Of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,1);</script>The whole earth was of
one language and of one speech. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,2);</script>It happened, as they traveled
east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they lived there.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,3);</script>They said one to another,
“Come, let’s make bricks, and burn them thoroughly.” They had brick
for stone, and they used tar for mortar. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,4);</script>They said, “Come, let’s build
ourselves a city, and a tower whose top reaches to the sky, and let’s
make ourselves a name, lest we be scattered abroad on the surface of the
whole earth.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,5);</script>Yahweh came down to
see the city and the tower, which the children of men built. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,6);</script>Yahweh said, “Behold, they are
one people, and they have all one language, and this is what they begin to
do. Now nothing will be withheld from them, which they intend to do.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,7);</script>Come, let’s go down,
and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one
another’s speech.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,8);</script>So
Yahweh scattered them abroad from there on the surface of all the earth.
They stopped building the city. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,9);</script>Therefore its name was called
Babel, because there Yahweh confused the language of all the earth. From
there, Yahweh scattered them abroad on the surface of all the earth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,10);</script>This is the history
of the generations of Shem. Shem was one hundred years old and became the
father of Arpachshad two years after the flood. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,11);</script>Shem lived five hundred years
after he became the father of Arpachshad, and became the father of sons
and daughters.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,12);</script>Arpachshad lived
thirty-five years and became the father of Shelah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,13);</script>Arpachshad lived four hundred
three years after he became the father of Shelah, and became the father of
sons and daughters.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,14);</script>Shelah lived thirty
years, and became the father of Eber: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,15);</script>and Shelah lived four hundred
three years after he became the father of Eber, and became the father of
sons and daughters.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,16);</script>Eber lived
thirty-four years, and became the father of Peleg. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,17);</script>Eber lived four hundred thirty
years after he became the father of Peleg, and became the father of sons
and daughters.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,18);</script>Peleg lived thirty
years, and became the father of Reu. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,19);</script>Peleg lived two hundred nine
years after he became the father of Reu, and became the father of sons and
daughters.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,20);</script>Reu lived thirty-two
years, and became the father of Serug. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,21);</script>Reu lived two hundred seven
years after he became the father of Serug, and became the father of sons
and daughters.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,22);</script>Serug lived thirty
years, and became the father of Nahor. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,23);</script>Serug lived two hundred years
after he became the father of Nahor, and became the father of sons and
daughters.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,24);</script>Nahor lived
twenty-nine years, and became the father of Terah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,25);</script>Nahor lived one hundred nineteen
years after he became the father of Terah, and became the father of sons
and daughters.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,26);</script>Terah lived seventy
years, and became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,27);</script>Now this is the
history of the generations of Terah. Terah became the father of Abram,
Nahor, and Haran. Haran became the father of Lot. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,28);</script>Haran died before his father
Terah in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldees. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,29);</script>Abram and Nahor took wives. The
name of Abram’s wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor’s wife, Milcah,
the daughter of Haran who was also the father of Iscah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,30);</script>Sarai was barren. She had no
child. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,31);</script>Terah took Abram
his son, Lot the son of Haran, his son’s son, and Sarai his
daughter-in-law, his son Abram’s wife. They went from Ur of the
Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan. They came to Haran and lived
there. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,32);</script>The days of Terah
were two hundred five years. Terah died in Haran.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,1);</script>Now Yahweh said to
Abram, “Get out of your country, and from your relatives, and from your
father’s house, to the land that I will show you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,2);</script>I will make of you a great
nation. I will bless you and make your name great. You will be a blessing.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(12,3);</script>I will bless those who
bless you, and I will curse him who curses you. All of the families of the
earth will be blessed in you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,4);</script>So Abram went, as
Yahweh had spoken to him. Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years
old when he departed out of Haran. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,5);</script>Abram took Sarai his wife, Lot
his brother’s son, all their substance that they had gathered, and the
souls whom they had gotten in Haran, and they went to go into the land of
Canaan. Into the land of Canaan they came. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,6);</script>Abram passed through the land to
the place of Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. The Canaanite was then in the
land.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,7);</script>Yahweh appeared to
Abram and said, “I will give this land to your <a href="#N4">seed</a>.”
<p>He built an altar there to Yahweh, who appeared to him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,8);</script>He left from there to the
mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the
west, and Ai on the east. There he built an altar to Yahweh and called on
the name of Yahweh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,9);</script>Abram
traveled, going on still toward the South.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,10);</script>There was a famine in
the land. Abram went down into Egypt to live as a foreigner there, for the
famine was severe in the land. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,11);</script>It happened, when he had come
near to enter Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, “See now, I know
that you are a beautiful woman to look at. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,12);</script>It will happen, when the
Egyptians will see you, that they will say, ‘This is his wife.’ They
will kill me, but they will save you alive. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,13);</script>Please say that you are my
sister, that it may be well with me for your sake, and that my soul may
live because of you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,14);</script>It happened that when
Abram had come into Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the woman was very
beautiful. <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,15);</script>The princes
of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh; and the woman was taken
into Pharaoh’s house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,16);</script>He dealt well with Abram for her
sake. He had sheep, cattle, male donkeys, male servants, female servants,
female donkeys, and camels. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,17);</script>Yahweh plagued Pharaoh and his
house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram’s wife. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,18);</script>Pharaoh called Abram and said,
“What is this that you have done to me? Why didn’t you tell me that
she was your wife? <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,19);</script>Why
did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her to be my wife? Now
therefore, see your wife, take her, and go your way.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,20);</script>Pharaoh commanded men
concerning him, and they brought him on the way with his wife and all that
he had.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,1);</script>Abram went up out of
Egypt: he, his wife, all that he had, and Lot with him, into the South.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,2);</script>Abram was very rich in
livestock, in silver, and in gold. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,3);</script>He went on his journeys from the
South even to Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the
beginning, between Bethel and Ai, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,4);</script>to the place of the altar, which
he had made there at the first. There Abram called on the name of Yahweh.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,5);</script>Lot also, who went with
Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,6);</script>The land was not able to bear
them, that they might live together: for their substance was great, so
that they could not live together. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,7);</script>There was a strife between the
herdsmen of Abram’s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot’s livestock: and
the Canaanite and the Perizzite lived in the land at that time. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,8);</script>Abram said to Lot, “Please, let
there be no strife between me and you, and between my herdsmen and your
herdsmen; for we are relatives. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,9);</script>Isn’t the whole land before
you? Please separate yourself from me. If you go to the left hand, then I
will go to the right. Or if you go to the right hand, then I will go to
the left.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,10);</script>Lot lifted up his
eyes, and saw all the plain of the Jordan, that it was well-watered
everywhere, before Yahweh destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of
Yahweh, like the land of Egypt, as you go to Zoar. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,11);</script>So Lot chose the Plain of the
Jordan for himself. Lot traveled east, and they separated themselves the
one from the other. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,12);</script>Abram lived in the land of
Canaan, and Lot lived in the cities of the plain, and moved his tent as
far as Sodom. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,13);</script>Now the
men of Sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinners against Yahweh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,14);</script>Yahweh said to Abram,
after Lot was separated from him, “Now, lift up your eyes, and look from
the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and
westward, <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,15);</script>for all the
land which you see, I will give to you, and to your offspring forever.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,16);</script>I will make your
offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if a man can number the dust
of the earth, then your seed may also be numbered. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,17);</script>Arise, walk through the land in
its length and in its breadth; for I will give it to you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,18);</script>Abram moved his tent,
and came and lived by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built an
altar there to Yahweh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,1);</script>It happened in the
days of Amraphel, king of Shinar, Arioch, king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer,
king of Elam, and Tidal, king of Goiim, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,2);</script>that they made war with Bera,
king of Sodom, and with Birsha, king of Gomorrah, Shinab, king of Admah,
and Shemeber, king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar).
<script type="text/javascript">cb(14,3);</script>All these joined together
in the valley of Siddim (the same is the Salt Sea). <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,4);</script>Twelve years they served
Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year, they rebelled. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,5);</script>In the fourteenth year
Chedorlaomer came, and the kings who were with him, and struck the Rephaim
in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh
Kiriathaim, <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,6);</script>and the
Horites in their Mount Seir, to Elparan, which is by the wilderness.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(14,7);</script>They returned, and came
to En Mishpat (the same is Kadesh), and struck all the country of the
Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that lived in Hazazon Tamar. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,8);</script>The king of Sodom, and the king
of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king
of Bela (the same is Zoar) went out; and they set the battle in array
against them in the valley of Siddim; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,9);</script>against Chedorlaomer king of
Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch
king of Ellasar; four kings against the five. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,10);</script>Now the valley of Siddim was
full of tar pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and they fell
there, and those who remained fled to the hills. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,11);</script>They took all the goods of Sodom
and Gomorrah, and all their food, and went their way. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,12);</script>They took Lot, Abram’s
brother’s son, who lived in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,13);</script>One who had escaped
came and told Abram, the Hebrew. Now he lived by the oaks of Mamre, the
Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner; and these were allies of
Abram. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,14);</script>When Abram heard
that his relative was taken captive, he led out his trained men, born in
his house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued as far as Dan. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,15);</script>He divided himself against them
by night, he and his servants, and struck them, and pursued them to Hobah,
which is on the left hand of Damascus. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,16);</script>He brought back all the goods,
and also brought back his relative, Lot, and his goods, and the women
also, and the people.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,17);</script>The king of Sodom
went out to meet him, after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer
and the kings who were with him, at the valley of Shaveh (that is, the
King’s Valley). <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,18);</script>Melchizedek king of Salem
brought out bread and wine: and he was priest of God Most High. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,19);</script>He blessed him, and said,
“Blessed be Abram of God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth:
<script type="text/javascript">cb(14,20);</script>and blessed be God Most
High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand.”
<p>Abram gave him a tenth of all.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,21);</script>The king of Sodom
said to Abram, “Give me the people, and take the goods to yourself.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,22);</script>Abram said to the
king of Sodom, “I have lifted up my hand to Yahweh, God Most High,
possessor of heaven and earth, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,23);</script>that I will not take a thread
nor a sandal strap nor anything that is yours, lest you should say, ‘I
have made Abram rich.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,24);</script>I will accept nothing from you
except that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men who
went with me: Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre. Let them take their portion.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,1);</script>After these things the
word of Yahweh came to Abram in a vision, saying, “Don’t be afraid,
Abram. I am your shield, your exceedingly great reward.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,2);</script>Abram said, “<a
href="#N5">Lord</a> Yahweh, what will you give me, since I go childless,
and he who will inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,3);</script>Abram said, “Behold, to me you
have given no seed: and, behold, one born in my house is my heir.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,4);</script>Behold, the word of
Yahweh came to him, saying, “This man will not be your heir, but he who
will come out of your own body will be your heir.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,5);</script>Yahweh brought him outside, and
said, “Look now toward the sky, and count the stars, if you are able to
count them.” He said to Abram, “So shall your seed be.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,6);</script>He believed in Yahweh; and he
reckoned it to him for righteousness. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,7);</script>He said to him, “I am Yahweh
who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give you this land to
inherit it.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,8);</script>He said, “Lord
Yahweh, how will I know that I will inherit it?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,9);</script>He said to him,
“Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram
three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,10);</script>He brought him all of these, and
divided them in the middle, and laid each half opposite the other; but he
didn’t divide the birds. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,11);</script>The birds of prey came down on
the carcasses, and Abram drove them away.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,12);</script>When the sun was
going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram. Now terror and great darkness fell
on him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,13);</script>He said to
Abram, “Know for sure that your seed will live as foreigners in a land
that is not theirs, and will serve them. They will afflict them four
hundred years. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,14);</script>I will
also judge that nation, whom they will serve. Afterward they will come out
with great wealth, <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,15);</script>but
you will go to your fathers in peace. You will be buried in a good old
age. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,16);</script>In the fourth
generation they will come here again, for the iniquity of the Amorite is
not yet full.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,17);</script>It came
to pass that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold, a smoking
furnace, and a flaming torch passed between these pieces. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,18);</script>In that day Yahweh made a
covenant with Abram, saying, “To your seed I have given this land, from
the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,19);</script>the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the
Kadmonites, <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,20);</script>the
Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,21);</script>the Amorites, the Canaanites,
the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,1);</script>Now Sarai, Abram’s
wife, bore him no children. She had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name
was Hagar. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,2);</script>Sarai said to
Abram, “See now, Yahweh has restrained me from bearing. Please go in to
my handmaid. It may be that I will obtain children by her.” Abram
listened to the voice of Sarai. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,3);</script>Sarai, Abram’s wife, took Hagar
the Egyptian, her handmaid, after Abram had lived ten years in the land of
Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,4);</script>He went in to Hagar, and she
conceived. When she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised
in her eyes. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,5);</script>Sarai said
to Abram, “This wrong is your fault. I gave my handmaid into your bosom,
and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes.
Yahweh judge between me and you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,6);</script>But Abram said to
Sarai, “Behold, your maid is in your hand. Do to her whatever is good in
your eyes.” Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from her face.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,7);</script>The angel of Yahweh
found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the
way to Shur. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,8);</script>He said,
“Hagar, Sarai’s handmaid, where did you come from? Where are you
going?”
<p>She said, “I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sarai.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,9);</script>The angel of Yahweh
said to her, “Return to your mistress, and submit yourself under her
hands.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,10);</script>The angel of
Yahweh said to her, “I will greatly multiply your seed, that they will
not be numbered for multitude.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,11);</script>The angel of Yahweh said to her,
“Behold, you are with child, and will bear a son. You shall call his
name Ishmael, because Yahweh has heard your affliction. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,12);</script>He will be like a wild donkey
among men. His hand will be against every man, and every man’s hand
against him. He will live opposite all of his brothers.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,13);</script>She called the name
of Yahweh who spoke to her, “You are a God who sees,” for she said,
“Have I even stayed alive after seeing him?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,14);</script>Therefore the well was called <a
href="#N6">Beer Lahai Roi.</a> Behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,15);</script>Hagar bore a son for
Abram. Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,16);</script>Abram was eighty-six years old
when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,1);</script>When Abram was
ninety-nine years old, Yahweh appeared to Abram, and said to him, “I am
God Almighty. Walk before me, and be blameless. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,2);</script>I will make my covenant between
me and you, and will multiply you exceedingly.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,3);</script>Abram fell on his
face. God talked with him, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,4);</script>“As for me, behold, my covenant
is with you. You will be the father of a multitude of nations. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,5);</script>Neither will your name any more
be called Abram, but your name will be Abraham; for I have made you the
father of a multitude of nations. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,6);</script>I will make you exceedingly
fruitful, and I will make nations of you. Kings will come out of you.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(17,7);</script>I will establish my
covenant between me and you and your seed after you throughout their
generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God to you and to your
seed after you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,8);</script>I will
give to you, and to your seed after you, the land where you are traveling,
all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession. I will be their
God.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,9);</script>God said to Abraham,
“As for you, you will keep my covenant, you and your seed after you
throughout their generations. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,10);</script>This is my covenant, which you
shall keep, between me and you and your seed after you. Every male among
you shall be circumcised. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,11);</script>You shall be circumcised in the
flesh of your foreskin. It will be a token of the covenant between me and
you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,12);</script>He who is eight
days old will be circumcised among you, every male throughout your
generations, he who is born in the house, or bought with money from any
foreigner who is not of your seed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,13);</script>He who is born in your house,
and he who is bought with your money, must be circumcised. My covenant
will be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,14);</script>The uncircumcised male who is
not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off
from his people. He has broken my covenant.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,15);</script>God said to Abraham,
“As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but her name
will be Sarah. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,16);</script>I will
bless her, and moreover I will give you a son by her. Yes, I will bless
her, and she will be a mother of nations. Kings of peoples will come from
her.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,17);</script>Then Abraham fell on
his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, “Will a child be born to
him who is one hundred years old? Will Sarah, who is ninety years old,
give birth?” <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,18);</script>Abraham
said to God, “Oh that Ishmael might live before you!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,19);</script>God said, “No, but
Sarah, your wife, will bear you a son. You shall call his name <a
href="#N7">Isaac.</a> I will establish my covenant with him for an
everlasting covenant for his seed after him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,20);</script>As for Ishmael, I have heard
you. Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will
multiply him exceedingly. He will become the father of twelve princes, and
I will make him a great nation. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,21);</script>But my covenant I establish with
Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this set time next year.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,22);</script>When he finished
talking with him, God went up from Abraham. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,23);</script>Abraham took Ishmael his son,
all who were born in his house, and all who were bought with his money;
every male among the men of Abraham’s house, and circumcised the flesh
of their foreskin in the same day, as God had said to him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,24);</script>Abraham was ninety-nine years
old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,25);</script>Ishmael, his son, was thirteen
years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,26);</script>In the same day both Abraham and
Ishmael, his son, were circumcised. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,27);</script>All the men of his house, those
born in the house, and those bought with money of a foreigner, were
circumcised with him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,1);</script>Yahweh appeared to him
by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,2);</script>He lifted up his eyes and
looked, and saw that three men stood opposite him. When he saw them, he
ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself to the earth,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,3);</script>and said, “My lord, if
now I have found favor in your sight, please don’t go away from your
servant. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,4);</script>Now let a little
water be fetched, wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,5);</script>I will get a morsel of
bread so you can refresh your heart. After that you may go your way, now
that you have come to your servant.”
<p>They said, “Very well, do as you have said.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,6);</script>Abraham hurried into
the tent to Sarah, and said, “Quickly prepare three measures of fine
meal, knead it, and make cakes.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,7);</script>Abraham ran to the herd, and
fetched a tender and good calf, and gave it to the servant. He hurried to
dress it. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,8);</script>He took butter,
milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them. He stood
by them under the tree, and they ate.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,9);</script>They asked him,
“Where is Sarah, your wife?”
<p>He said, “See, in the tent.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,10);</script>He said, “I will
certainly return to you when the season comes round. Behold, Sarah your
wife will have a son.”
<p>Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,11);</script>Now Abraham and Sarah were old,
well advanced in age. Sarah had passed the age of childbearing. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,12);</script>Sarah laughed within herself,
saying, “After I have grown old will I have pleasure, my lord being old
also?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,13);</script>Yahweh said to
Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh, saying, ‘Will I really bear a child,
yet I am old?’ <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,14);</script>Is
anything too hard for Yahweh? At the set time I will return to you, when
the season comes round, and Sarah will have a son.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,15);</script>Then Sarah denied,
saying, “I didn’t laugh,” for she was afraid.
<p>He said, “No, but you did laugh.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,16);</script>The men rose up from
there, and looked toward Sodom. Abraham went with them to see them on
their way. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,17);</script>Yahweh said,
“Will I hide from Abraham what I do, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,18);</script>since Abraham has surely become
a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth will be
blessed in him? <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,19);</script>For I
have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his
household after him, that they may keep the way of Yahweh, to do
righteousness and justice; to the end that Yahweh may bring on Abraham
that which he has spoken of him.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,20);</script>Yahweh said, “Because the cry
of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,21);</script>I will go down now, and
see whether their deeds are as bad as the reports which have come to me.
If not, I will know.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,22);</script>The men turned from
there, and went toward Sodom, but Abraham stood yet before Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,23);</script>Abraham drew near, and said,
“Will you consume the righteous with the wicked? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,24);</script>What if there are fifty
righteous within the city? Will you consume and not spare the place for
the fifty righteous who are in it? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,25);</script>Be it far from you to do things
like that, to kill the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous
should be like the wicked. May that be far from you. Shouldn’t the Judge
of all the earth do right?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,26);</script>Yahweh said, “If I
find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the
place for their sake.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,27);</script>Abraham answered, “See now, I
have taken it on myself to speak to the Lord, who am but dust and ashes.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,28);</script>What if there will lack
five of the fifty righteous? Will you destroy all the city for lack of
five?”
<p>He said, “I will not destroy it, if I find forty-five there.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,29);</script>He spoke to him yet
again, and said, “What if there are forty found there?”
<p>He said, “I will not do it for the forty’s sake.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,30);</script>He said, “Oh
don’t let the Lord be angry, and I will speak. What if there are thirty
found there?”
<p>He said, “I will not do it, if I find thirty there.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,31);</script>He said, “See now,
I have taken it on myself to speak to the Lord. What if there are twenty
found there?”
<p>He said, “I will not destroy it for the twenty’s sake.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,32);</script>He said, “Oh
don’t let the Lord be angry, and I will speak just once more. What if
ten are found there?”
<p>He said, “I will not destroy it for the ten’s sake.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,33);</script>Yahweh went his way,
as soon as he had finished communing with Abraham, and Abraham returned to
his place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,1);</script>The two angels came to
Sodom at evening. Lot sat in the gate of Sodom. Lot saw them, and rose up
to meet them. He bowed himself with his face to the earth, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,2);</script>and he said, “See now, my
lords, please turn aside into your servant’s house, stay all night, wash
your feet, and you can rise up early, and go on your way.”
<p>They said, “No, but we will stay in the street all night.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,3);</script>He urged them greatly,
and they came in with him, and entered into his house. He made them a
feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,4);</script>But before they lay down, the men
of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both young and old,
all the people from every quarter. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,5);</script>They called to Lot, and said to
him, “Where are the men who came in to you this night? Bring them out to
us, that we may have sex with them.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,6);</script>Lot went out to them
to the door, and shut the door after him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,7);</script>He said, “Please, my brothers,
don’t act so wickedly. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,8);</script>See now, I have two virgin
daughters. Please let me bring them out to you, and you may do to them
what seems good to you. Only don’t do anything to these men, because
they have come under the shadow of my roof.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,9);</script>They said, “Stand
back!” Then they said, “This one fellow came in to live as a
foreigner, and he appoints himself a judge. Now will we deal worse with
you, than with them!” They pressed hard on the man Lot, and drew near to
break the door. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,10);</script>But the
men reached out their hand, and brought Lot into the house to them, and
shut the door. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,11);</script>They
struck the men who were at the door of the house with blindness, both
small and great, so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,12);</script>The men said to Lot,
“Do you have anybody else here? Sons-in-law, your sons, your daughters,
and whoever you have in the city, bring them out of the place: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,13);</script>for we will destroy this place,
because the outcry against them has grown great before Yahweh that Yahweh
has sent us to destroy it.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,14);</script>Lot went out, and
spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry his daughters, and
said, “Get up! Get out of this place, for Yahweh will destroy the
city.”
<p>But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be joking. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,15);</script>When the morning came, then the
angels hurried Lot, saying, “Get up! Take your wife, and your two
daughters who are here, lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the
city.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,16);</script>But he
lingered; and the men grabbed his hand, his wife’s hand, and his two
daughters’ hands, Yahweh being merciful to him; and they took him out,
and set him outside of the city. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,17);</script>It came to pass, when they had
taken them out, that he said, “Escape for your life! Don’t look behind
you, and don’t stay anywhere in the plain. Escape to the mountains, lest
you be consumed!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,18);</script>Lot said to them,
“Oh, not so, my lord. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,19);</script>See now, your servant has found
favor in your sight, and you have magnified your loving kindness, which
you have shown to me in saving my life. I can’t escape to the mountain,
lest evil overtake me, and I die. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,20);</script>See now, this city is near to
flee to, and it is a little one. Oh let me escape there (isn’t it a
little one?), and my soul will live.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,21);</script>He said to him,
“Behold, I have granted your request concerning this thing also, that I
will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,22);</script>Hurry, escape there, for I
can’t do anything until you get there.” Therefore the name of the city
was called <a href="#N8">Zoar.</a>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,23);</script>The sun had risen on
the earth when Lot came to Zoar. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,24);</script>Then Yahweh rained on Sodom and
on Gomorrah sulfur and fire from Yahweh out of the sky. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,25);</script>He overthrew those cities, all
the plain, all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew on the
ground. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,26);</script>But his wife
looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,27);</script>Abraham got up early
in the morning to the place where he had stood before Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,28);</script>He looked toward Sodom and
Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and looked, and saw that
the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,29);</script>It happened, when God
destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent
Lot out of the middle of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in
which Lot lived.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,30);</script>Lot went up out of
Zoar, and lived in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he
was afraid to live in Zoar. He lived in a cave with his two daughters.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(19,31);</script>The firstborn said to
the younger, “Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to
come in to us in the way of all the earth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,32);</script>Come, let’s make our father
drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve our father’s
seed.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,33);</script>They made their
father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her
father. He didn’t know when she lay down, nor when she arose. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,34);</script>It came to pass on the next day,
that the firstborn said to the younger, “Behold, I lay last night with
my father. Let us make him drink wine again, tonight. You go in, and lie
with him, that we may preserve our father’s seed.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,35);</script>They made their father drink
wine that night also. The younger went and lay with him. He didn’t know
when she lay down, nor when she got up. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,36);</script>Thus both of Lot’s daughters
were with child by their father. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,37);</script>The firstborn bore a son, and
named him Moab. He is the father of the Moabites to this day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,38);</script>The younger also bore a son, and
called his name Ben Ammi. He is the father of the children of Ammon to
this day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,1);</script>Abraham traveled from
there toward the land of the South, and lived between Kadesh and Shur. He
lived as a foreigner in Gerar. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,2);</script>Abraham said about Sarah his
wife, “She is my sister.” Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took
Sarah. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,3);</script>But God came to
Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, “Behold, you are a
dead man, because of the woman whom you have taken. For she is a man’s
wife.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,4);</script>Now Abimelech had not
come near her. He said, “Lord, will you kill even a righteous nation?
<script type="text/javascript">cb(20,5);</script>Didn’t he tell me,
‘She is my sister?’ She, even she herself, said, ‘He is my
brother.’ In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands
have I done this.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,6);</script>God said to him in the
dream, “Yes, I know that in the integrity of your heart you have done
this, and I also withheld you from sinning against me. Therefore I
didn’t allow you to touch her. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,7);</script>Now therefore, restore the
man’s wife. For he is a prophet, and he will pray for you, and you will
live. If you don’t restore her, know for sure that you will die, you,
and all who are yours.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,8);</script>Abimelech rose early
in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in
their ear. The men were very scared. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,9);</script>Then Abimelech called Abraham,
and said to him, “What have you done to us? How have I sinned against
you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have
done deeds to me that ought not to be done!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,10);</script>Abimelech said to Abraham,
“What did you see, that you have done this thing?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,11);</script>Abraham said,
“Because I thought, ‘Surely the fear of God is not in this place. They
will kill me for my wife’s sake.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,12);</script>Besides, she is indeed my
sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and
she became my wife. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,13);</script>It
happened, when God caused me to wander from my father’s house, that I
said to her, ‘This is your kindness which you shall show to me.
Everywhere that we go, say of me, “He is my brother.”’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,14);</script>Abimelech took sheep
and cattle, male servants and female servants, and gave them to Abraham,
and restored Sarah, his wife, to him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,15);</script>Abimelech said, “Behold, my
land is before you. Dwell where it pleases you.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,16);</script>To Sarah he said, “Behold, I
have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. Behold, it is for you
a covering of the eyes to all that are with you. In front of all you are
vindicated.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,17);</script>Abraham prayed to
God. God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his female servants, and they
bore children. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,18);</script>For
Yahweh had closed up tight all the wombs of the house of Abimelech,
because of Sarah, Abraham’s wife.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,1);</script>Yahweh visited Sarah
as he had said, and Yahweh did to Sarah as he had spoken. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,2);</script>Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham
a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(21,3);</script>Abraham called his son
who was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, <a href="#N9">Isaac.</a>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(21,4);</script>Abraham circumcised his
son, Isaac, when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,5);</script>Abraham was one hundred years old
when his son, Isaac, was born to him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,6);</script>Sarah said, “God has made me
laugh. Everyone who hears will laugh with me.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,7);</script>She said, “Who would have said
to Abraham, that Sarah would nurse children? For I have borne him a son in
his old age.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,8);</script>The child grew, and
was weaned. Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(21,9);</script>Sarah saw the son of
Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,10);</script>Therefore she said to Abraham,
“Cast out this handmaid and her son! For the son of this handmaid will
not be heir with my son, Isaac.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,11);</script>The thing was very
grievous in Abraham’s sight on account of his son. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,12);</script>God said to Abraham, “Don’t
let it be grievous in your sight because of the boy, and because of your
handmaid. In all that Sarah says to you, listen to her voice. For from
Isaac will your seed be called. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,13);</script>I will also make a nation of the
son of the handmaid, because he is your seed.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,14);</script>Abraham rose up early in the
morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and gave it to Hagar,
putting it on her shoulder; and gave her the child, and sent her away. She
departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,15);</script>The water in the bottle was
spent, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,16);</script>She went and sat down opposite
him, a good way off, about a bow shot away. For she said, “Don’t let
me see the death of the child.” She sat over against him, and lifted up
her voice, and wept. <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,17);</script>God
heard the voice of the boy.
<p>The angel of God called to Hagar out of the sky, and said to her,
“What ails you, Hagar? Don’t be afraid. For God has heard the voice of
the boy where he is. <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,18);</script>Get
up, lift up the boy, and hold him in your hand. For I will make him a
great nation.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,19);</script>God opened her eyes,
and she saw a well of water. She went, filled the bottle with water, and
gave the boy drink. <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,20);</script>God
was with the boy, and he grew. He lived in the wilderness, and became, as
he grew up, an archer. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,21);</script>He lived in the wilderness of
Paran. His mother took a wife for him out of the land of Egypt.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,22);</script>It happened at that
time, that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his army spoke to Abraham,
saying, “God is with you in all that you do. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,23);</script>Now, therefore, swear to me here
by God that you will not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with
my son’s son. But according to the kindness that I have done to you, you
shall do to me, and to the land in which you have lived as a foreigner.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,24);</script>Abraham said, “I
will swear.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,25);</script>Abraham
complained to Abimelech because of a water well, which Abimelech’s
servants had violently taken away. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,26);</script>Abimelech said, “I don’t
know who has done this thing. You didn’t tell me, neither did I hear of
it, until today.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,27);</script>Abraham took sheep
and cattle, and gave them to Abimelech. Those two made a covenant. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,28);</script>Abraham set seven ewe lambs of
the flock by themselves. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,29);</script>Abimelech said to Abraham,
“What do these seven ewe lambs which you have set by themselves mean?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,30);</script>He said, “You shall
take these seven ewe lambs from my hand, that it may be a witness to me,
that I have dug this well.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,31);</script>Therefore he called that place
<a href="#N10">Beersheba,</a> because they both swore there. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,32);</script>So they made a covenant at
Beersheba. Abimelech rose up with Phicol, the captain of his army, and
they returned into the land of the Philistines. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,33);</script>Abraham planted a tamarisk tree
in Beersheba, and called there on the name of Yahweh, the Everlasting God.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(21,34);</script>Abraham lived as a
foreigner in the land of the Philistines many days.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,1);</script>It happened after
these things, that God tested Abraham, and said to him, “Abraham!”
<p>He said, “Here I am.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,2);</script>He said, “Now take
your son, your only son, whom you love, even Isaac, and go into the land
of Moriah. Offer him there for a burnt offering on one of the mountains
which I will tell you of.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,3);</script>Abraham rose early in
the morning, and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with
him, and Isaac his son. He split the wood for the burnt offering, and rose
up, and went to the place of which God had told him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,4);</script>On the third day Abraham lifted
up his eyes, and saw the place far off. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,5);</script>Abraham said to his young men,
“Stay here with the donkey. The boy and I will go yonder. We will
worship, and come back to you.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,6);</script>Abraham took the wood of the
burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son. He took in his hand the fire
and the knife. They both went together. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,7);</script>Isaac spoke to Abraham his
father, and said, “My father?”
<p>He said, “Here I am, my son.”
<p>He said, “Here is the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a
burnt offering?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,8);</script>Abraham said, “God
will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.” So they
both went together. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,9);</script>They
came to the place which God had told him of. Abraham built the altar
there, and laid the wood in order, bound Isaac his son, and laid him on
the altar, on the wood. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,10);</script>Abraham stretched out his hand,
and took the knife to kill his son.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,11);</script>The angel of Yahweh
called to him out of the sky, and said, “Abraham, Abraham!”
<p>He said, “Here I am.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,12);</script>He said, “Don’t
lay your hand on the boy, neither do anything to him. For now I know that
you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from
me.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,13);</script>Abraham lifted up his
eyes, and looked, and saw that behind him was a ram caught in the thicket
by his horns. Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a
burnt offering instead of his son. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,14);</script>Abraham called the name of that
place <a href="#N11">Yahweh Will Provide</a>. As it is said to this day,
“On Yahweh’s mountain, it will be provided.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,15);</script>The angel of Yahweh
called to Abraham a second time out of the sky, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,16);</script>and said, “I have sworn by
myself, says Yahweh, because you have done this thing, and have not
withheld your son, your only son, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,17);</script>that I will bless you greatly,
and I will multiply your seed greatly like the stars of the heavens, and
like the sand which is on the seashore. Your seed will possess the gate of
his enemies. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,18);</script>In your
seed will all the nations of the earth be blessed, because you have obeyed
my voice.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,19);</script>So Abraham returned
to his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba. Abraham
lived at Beersheba.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,20);</script>It happened after
these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, “Behold, Milcah, she
also has borne children to your brother Nahor: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,21);</script>Uz his firstborn, Buz his
brother, Kemuel the father of Aram, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,22);</script>Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph,
and Bethuel.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,23);</script>Bethuel
became the father of Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor,
Abraham’s brother. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,24);</script>His
concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and
Maacah.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,1);</script>Sarah lived one
hundred twenty-seven years. This was the length of Sarah’s life. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,2);</script>Sarah died in Kiriath Arba (the
same is Hebron), in the land of Canaan. Abraham came to mourn for Sarah,
and to weep for her. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,3);</script>Abraham rose up from before his
dead, and spoke to the children of Heth, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,4);</script>“I am a stranger and a
foreigner living with you. Give me a possession of a burying-place with
you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,5);</script>The children of Heth
answered Abraham, saying to him, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,6);</script>“Hear us, my lord. You are a
prince of God among us. Bury your dead in the best of our tombs. None of
us will withhold from you his tomb. Bury your dead.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,7);</script>Abraham rose up, and
bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(23,8);</script>He talked with them,
saying, “If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight,
hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,9);</script>that he may give me the cave of
Machpelah, which he has, which is in the end of his field. For the full
price let him give it to me among you for a possession of a
burying-place.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,10);</script>Now Ephron was
sitting in the middle of the children of Heth. Ephron the Hittite answered
Abraham in the hearing of the children of Heth, even of all who went in at
the gate of his city, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,11);</script>“No, my lord, hear me. I give
you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. In the presence of
the children of my people I give it to you. Bury your dead.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,12);</script>Abraham bowed himself
down before the people of the land. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,13);</script>He spoke to Ephron in the
audience of the people of the land, saying, “But if you will, please
hear me. I will give the price of the field. Take it from me, and I will
bury my dead there.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,14);</script>Ephron answered
Abraham, saying to him, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,15);</script>“My lord, listen to me. What
is a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver between me and
you? Therefore bury your dead.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,16);</script>Abraham listened to
Ephron. Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the
audience of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver,
according to the current merchants’ standard.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,17);</script>So the field of
Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, the
cave which was in it, and all the trees that were in the field, that were
in all of its borders, were deeded <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,18);</script>to Abraham for a possession in
the presence of the children of Heth, before all who went in at the gate
of his city. <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,19);</script>After this,
Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before
Mamre (that is, Hebron), in the land of Canaan. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,20);</script>The field, and the cave that is
in it, were deeded to Abraham for a possession of a burying place by the
children of Heth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,1);</script>Abraham was old, and
well stricken in age. Yahweh had blessed Abraham in all things. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,2);</script>Abraham said to his servant, the
elder of his house, who ruled over all that he had, “Please put your
hand under my thigh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,3);</script>I
will make you swear by Yahweh, the God of heaven and the God of the earth,
that you shall not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the
Canaanites, among whom I live. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,4);</script>But you shall go to my country,
and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son Isaac.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,5);</script>The servant said to
him, “What if the woman isn’t willing to follow me to this land? Must
I bring your son again to the land you came from?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,6);</script>Abraham said to him,
“Beware that you don’t bring my son there again. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,7);</script>Yahweh, the God of heaven, who
took me from my father’s house, and from the land of my birth, who spoke
to me, and who swore to me, saying, ‘I will give this land to your <a
href="#N12">seed</a>.’ He will send his angel before you, and you shall
take a wife for my son from there. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,8);</script>If the woman isn’t willing to
follow you, then you shall be clear from this my oath. Only you shall not
bring my son there again.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,9);</script>The servant put his
hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning
this matter. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,10);</script>The servant
took ten camels, of his master’s camels, and departed, having a variety
of good things of his master’s with him. He arose, and went to
Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,11);</script>He made the camels kneel down
outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time
that women go out to draw water. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,12);</script>He said, “Yahweh, the God of
my master Abraham, please give me success this day, and show kindness to
my master Abraham. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,13);</script>Behold, I am standing by the
spring of water. The daughters of the men of the city are coming out to
draw water. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,14);</script>Let it
happen, that the young lady to whom I will say, ‘Please let down your
pitcher, that I may drink,’ and she will say, ‘Drink, and I will also
give your camels a drink,’—let her be the one you have appointed for
your servant Isaac. By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my
master.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,15);</script>It happened, before
he had finished speaking, that behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to
Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, with
her pitcher on her shoulder. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,16);</script>The young lady was very
beautiful to look at, a virgin, neither had any man known her. She went
down to the spring, filled her pitcher, and came up. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,17);</script>The servant ran to meet her, and
said, “Please give me a drink, a little water from your pitcher.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,18);</script>She said, “Drink,
my lord.” She hurried, and let down her pitcher on her hand, and gave
him drink. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,19);</script>When she had
done giving him drink, she said, “I will also draw for your camels,
until they have done drinking.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,20);</script>She hurried, and emptied her
pitcher into the trough, and ran again to the well to draw, and drew for
all his camels.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,21);</script>The man looked
steadfastly at her, remaining silent, to know whether Yahweh had made his
journey prosperous or not. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,22);</script>It happened, as the camels had
done drinking, that the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight,
and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,23);</script>and said, “Whose daughter are
you? Please tell me. Is there room in your father’s house for us to
lodge in?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,24);</script>She said to him, “I
am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(24,25);</script>She said moreover to
him, “We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,26);</script>The man bowed his
head, and worshiped Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,27);</script>He said, “Blessed be Yahweh,
the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken his loving kindness and
his truth toward my master. As for me, Yahweh has led me in the way to the
house of my master’s relatives.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,28);</script>The young lady ran,
and told her mother’s house about these words. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,29);</script>Rebekah had a brother, and his
name was Laban. Laban ran out to the man, to the spring. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,30);</script>It happened, when he saw the
ring, and the bracelets on his sister’s hands, and when he heard the
words of Rebekah his sister, saying, “This is what the man said to
me,” that he came to the man. Behold, he was standing by the camels at
the spring. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,31);</script>He said,
“Come in, you blessed of Yahweh. Why do you stand outside? For I have
prepared the house, and room for the camels.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,32);</script>The man came into the
house, and he unloaded the camels. He gave straw and provender for the
camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with
him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,33);</script>Food was set before
him to eat, but he said, “I will not eat until I have told my message.”
<p>He said, “Speak on.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,34);</script>He said, “I am
Abraham’s servant. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,35);</script>Yahweh has blessed my master
greatly. He has become great. He has given him flocks and herds, silver
and gold, male servants and female servants, and camels and donkeys.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(24,36);</script>Sarah, my master’s
wife, bore a son to my master when she was old. He has given all that he
has to him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,37);</script>My master
made me swear, saying, ‘You shall not take a wife for my son of the
daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,38);</script>but you shall go to my
father’s house, and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son.’
<script type="text/javascript">cb(24,39);</script>I asked my master,
‘What if the woman will not follow me?’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,40);</script>He said to me, ‘Yahweh, before
whom I walk, will send his angel with you, and prosper your way. You shall
take a wife for my son of my relatives, and of my father’s house.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(24,41);</script>Then will you be clear
from my oath, when you come to my relatives. If they don’t give her to
you, you shall be clear from my oath.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,42);</script>I came this day to the spring,
and said, ‘Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, if now you do prosper
my way which I go—<script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,43);</script>behold, I am standing by this
spring of water. Let it happen, that the maiden who comes out to draw, to
whom I will say, “Please give me a little water from your pitcher to
drink,” <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,44);</script>and she will
tell me, “Drink, and I will also draw for your camels,”—let her be
the woman whom Yahweh has appointed for my master’s son.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,45);</script>Before I had finished speaking
in my heart, behold, Rebekah came out with her pitcher on her shoulder.
She went down to the spring, and drew. I said to her, ‘Please let me
drink.’ <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,46);</script>She hurried
and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, ‘Drink, and I will
also give your camels a drink.’ So I drank, and she also gave the camels
a drink. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,47);</script>I asked her,
and said, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ She said, ‘The daughter of
Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bore to him.’ I put the ring on her
nose, and the bracelets on her hands. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,48);</script>I bowed my head, and worshiped
Yahweh, and blessed Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me
in the right way to take my master’s brother’s daughter for his son.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(24,49);</script>Now if you will deal
kindly and truly with my master, tell me. If not, tell me, that I may turn
to the right hand, or to the left.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,50);</script>Then Laban and
Bethuel answered, “The thing proceeds from Yahweh. We can’t speak to
you bad or good. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,51);</script>Behold,
Rebekah is before you. Take her, and go, and let her be your master’s
son’s wife, as Yahweh has spoken.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,52);</script>It happened that when
Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed himself down to the earth
to Yahweh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,53);</script>The servant
brought out jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing, and gave
them to Rebekah. He also gave precious things to her brother and her
mother. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,54);</script>They ate and
drank, he and the men who were with him, and stayed all night. They rose
up in the morning, and he said, “Send me away to my master.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,55);</script>Her brother and her
mother said, “Let the young lady stay with us a few days, at least ten.
After that she will go.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,56);</script>He said to them,
“Don’t hinder me, since Yahweh has prospered my way. Send me away that
I may go to my master.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,57);</script>They said, “We will
call the young lady, and ask her.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,58);</script>They called Rebekah, and said to
her, “Will you go with this man?”
<p>She said, “I will go.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,59);</script>They sent away
Rebekah, their sister, with her nurse, Abraham’s servant, and his men.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(24,60);</script>They blessed Rebekah,
and said to her, “Our sister, may you be the mother of thousands of ten
thousands, and let your seed possess the gate of those who hate them.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,61);</script>Rebekah arose with
her ladies. They rode on the camels, and followed the man. The servant
took Rebekah, and went his way. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,62);</script>Isaac came from the way of Beer
Lahai Roi, for he lived in the land of the South. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,63);</script>Isaac went out to meditate in
the field at the evening. He lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold,
there were camels coming. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,64);</script>Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and
when she saw Isaac, she dismounted from the camel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,65);</script>She said to the servant, “Who
is the man who is walking in the field to meet us?”
<p>The servant said, “It is my master.”
<p>She took her veil, and covered herself. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,66);</script>The servant told Isaac all the
things that he had done. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,67);</script>Isaac brought her into his
mother Sarah’s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife. He loved
her. Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,1);</script>Abraham took another
wife, and her name was Keturah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,2);</script>She bore him Zimran, Jokshan,
Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,3);</script>Jokshan became the father of
Sheba, and Dedan. The sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(25,4);</script>The sons of Midian:
Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of
Keturah. <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,5);</script>Abraham gave all
that he had to Isaac, <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,6);</script>but
to the sons of Abraham’s concubines, Abraham gave gifts. He sent them
away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, to the east
country. <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,7);</script>These are the
days of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived: one hundred
seventy-five years. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,8);</script>Abraham gave up the spirit, and
died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years, and was gathered to
his people. <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,9);</script>Isaac and
Ishmael, his sons, buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of
Ephron, the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,10);</script>the field which Abraham
purchased of the children of Heth. Abraham was buried there with Sarah,
his wife. <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,11);</script>It happened
after the death of Abraham that God blessed Isaac, his son. Isaac lived by
Beer Lahai Roi.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,12);</script>Now this is the
history of the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the
Egyptian, Sarah’s handmaid, bore to Abraham. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,13);</script>These are the names of the sons
of Ishmael, by their names, according to the order of their birth: the
firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,14);</script>Mishma, Dumah, Massa, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,15);</script>Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and
Kedemah. <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,16);</script>These are the
sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by
their encampments: twelve princes, according to their nations. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,17);</script>These are the years of the life
of Ishmael: one hundred thirty-seven years. He gave up the spirit and
died, and was gathered to his people. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,18);</script>They lived from Havilah to Shur
that is before Egypt, as you go toward Assyria. He lived opposite all his
relatives.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,19);</script>This is the history
of the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son. Abraham became the father of
Isaac. <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,20);</script>Isaac was forty
years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of
Paddan Aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,21);</script>Isaac entreated Yahweh for his
wife, because she was barren. Yahweh was entreated by him, and Rebekah his
wife conceived. <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,22);</script>The
children struggled together within her. She said, “If it be so, why do I
live?” She went to inquire of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,23);</script>Yahweh said to her,
<dl>
<dt>“Two nations are in your womb.
<dt>Two peoples will be separated from your body.
<dt>The one people will be stronger than the other people.
<dt>The elder will serve the younger.”
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,24);</script>When her days to be
delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,25);</script>The first came out red all over,
like a hairy garment. They named him Esau. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,26);</script>After that, his brother came
out, and his hand had hold on Esau’s heel. He was named Jacob. Isaac was
sixty years old when she bore them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,27);</script>The boys grew. Esau
was a skillful hunter, a man of the field. Jacob was a quiet man, living
in tents. <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,28);</script>Now Isaac
loved Esau, because he ate his venison. Rebekah loved Jacob. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,29);</script>Jacob boiled stew. Esau came in
from the field, and he was famished. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,30);</script>Esau said to Jacob, “Please
feed me with that same red stew, for I am famished.” Therefore his name
was called Edom.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,31);</script>Jacob said, “First,
sell me your birthright.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,32);</script>Esau said, “Behold,
I am about to die. What good is the birthright to me?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,33);</script>Jacob said, “Swear
to me first.”
<p>He swore to him. He sold his birthright to Jacob. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,34);</script>Jacob gave Esau bread and stew
of lentils. He ate and drank, rose up, and went his way. So Esau despised
his birthright.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,1);</script>There was a famine in
the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. Isaac
went to Abimelech king of the Philistines, to Gerar. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,2);</script>Yahweh appeared to him, and said,
“Don’t go down into Egypt. Live in the land I will tell you about.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(26,3);</script>Live in this land, and I
will be with you, and will bless you. For to you, and to your seed, I will
give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I swore to
Abraham your father. <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,4);</script>I
will multiply your seed as the stars of the sky, and will give to your
seed all these lands. In your seed will all the nations of the earth be
blessed, <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,5);</script>because Abraham
obeyed my voice, and kept my requirements, my commandments, my statutes,
and my laws.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,6);</script>Isaac lived in Gerar.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(26,7);</script>The men of the place
asked him about his wife. He said, “She is my sister,” for he was
afraid to say, “My wife,” lest, he thought, “the men of the place
might kill me for Rebekah, because she is beautiful to look at.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,8);</script>It happened, when he had been
there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a
window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was caressing Rebekah, his wife.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(26,9);</script>Abimelech called Isaac,
and said, “Behold, surely she is your wife. Why did you say, ‘She is
my sister?’”
<p>Isaac said to him, “Because I said, ‘Lest I die because of
her.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,10);</script>Abimelech said,
“What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have
lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,11);</script>Abimelech commanded
all the people, saying, “He who touches this man or his wife will surely
be put to death.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,12);</script>Isaac sowed in that
land, and reaped in the same year one hundred times what he planted.
Yahweh blessed him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,13);</script>The
man grew great, and grew more and more until he became very great. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,14);</script>He had possessions of flocks,
possessions of herds, and a great household. The Philistines envied him.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(26,15);</script>Now all the wells which
his father’s servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the
Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,16);</script>Abimelech said to Isaac, “Go
from us, for you are much mightier than we.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,17);</script>Isaac departed from
there, encamped in the valley of Gerar, and lived there.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,18);</script>Isaac dug again the
wells of water, which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father. For
the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham. He called
their names after the names by which his father had called them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,19);</script>Isaac’s servants dug in the
valley, and found there a well of springing water. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,20);</script>The herdsmen of Gerar argued
with Isaac’s herdsmen, saying, “The water is ours.” He called the
name of the well Esek, because they contended with him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,21);</script>They dug another well, and they
argued over that, also. He called its name Sitnah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,22);</script>He left that place, and dug
another well. They didn’t argue over that one. He called it Rehoboth. He
said, “For now Yahweh has made room for us, and we will be fruitful in
the land.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,23);</script>He went up from there
to Beersheba. <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,24);</script>Yahweh
appeared to him the same night, and said, “I am the God of Abraham your
father. Don’t be afraid, for I am with you, and will bless you, and
multiply your seed for my servant Abraham’s sake.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,25);</script>He built an altar
there, and called on the name of Yahweh, and pitched his tent there. There
Isaac’s servants dug a well.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,26);</script>Then Abimelech went
to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his
army. <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,27);</script>Isaac said to
them, “Why have you come to me, since you hate me, and have sent me away
from you?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,28);</script>They said, “We saw
plainly that Yahweh was with you. We said, ‘Let there now be an oath
between us, even between us and you, and let us make a covenant with you,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(26,29);</script>that you will do us no
harm, as we have not touched you, and as we have done to you nothing but
good, and have sent you away in peace.’ You are now the blessed of
Yahweh.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,30);</script>He made them a feast,
and they ate and drank. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,31);</script>They rose up some time in the
morning, and swore one to another. Isaac sent them away, and they departed
from him in peace. <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,32);</script>It
happened the same day, that Isaac’s servants came, and told him
concerning the well which they had dug, and said to him, “We have found
water.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,33);</script>He called it
<a href="#N13">Shibah.</a> Therefore the name of the city is <a
href="#N14">Beersheba</a> to this day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,34);</script>When Esau was forty
years old, he took as wife Judith, the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and
Basemath, the daughter of Elon the Hittite. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,35);</script>They grieved Isaac’s and
Rebekah’s spirits.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,1);</script>It happened, that when
Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called
Esau his elder son, and said to him, “My son?”
<p>He said to him, “Here I am.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,2);</script>He said, “See now, I
am old. I don’t know the day of my death. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,3);</script>Now therefore, please take your
weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and take me
venison. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,4);</script>Make me savory
food, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat, and that my soul
may bless you before I die.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,5);</script>Rebekah heard when
Isaac spoke to Esau his son. Esau went to the field to hunt for venison,
and to bring it. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,6);</script>Rebekah
spoke to Jacob her son, saying, “Behold, I heard your father speak to
Esau your brother, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,7);</script>‘Bring me venison, and make me
savory food, that I may eat, and bless you before Yahweh before my
death.’ <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,8);</script>Now therefore,
my son, obey my voice according to that which I command you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,9);</script>Go now to the flock, and get me
from there two good young goats. I will make them savory food for your
father, such as he loves. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,10);</script>You shall bring it to your
father, that he may eat, so that he may bless you before his death.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,11);</script>Jacob said to Rebekah
his mother, “Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth
man. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,12);</script>What if my father
touches me? I will seem to him as a deceiver, and I would bring a curse on
myself, and not a blessing.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,13);</script>His mother said to
him, “Let your curse be on me, my son. Only obey my voice, and go get
them for me.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,14);</script>He went, and got
them, and brought them to his mother. His mother made savory food, such as
his father loved. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,15);</script>Rebekah took the good clothes of
Esau, her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them on
Jacob, her younger son. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,16);</script>She put the skins of the young
goats on his hands, and on the smooth of his neck. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,17);</script>She gave the savory food and the
bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,18);</script>He came to his
father, and said, “My father?”
<p>He said, “Here I am. Who are you, my son?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,19);</script>Jacob said to his
father, “I am Esau your firstborn. I have done what you asked me to do.
Please arise, sit and eat of my venison, that your soul may bless me.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,20);</script>Isaac said to his
son, “How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?”
<p>He said, “Because Yahweh your God gave me success.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,21);</script>Isaac said to Jacob,
“Please come near, that I may feel you, my son, whether you are really
my son Esau or not.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,22);</script>Jacob went near to
Isaac his father. He felt him, and said, “The voice is Jacob’s voice,
but the hands are the hands of Esau.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,23);</script>He didn’t recognize him,
because his hands were hairy, like his brother, Esau’s hands. So he
blessed him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,24);</script>He said,
“Are you really my son Esau?”
<p>He said, “I am.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,25);</script>He said, “Bring it
near to me, and I will eat of my son’s venison, that my soul may bless
you.”
<p>He brought it near to him, and he ate. He brought him wine, and he
drank. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,26);</script>His father Isaac
said to him, “Come near now, and kiss me, my son.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,27);</script>He came near, and kissed him. He
smelled the smell of his clothing, and blessed him, and said,
<dl>
<dt>“Behold, the smell of my son
<dd>is as the smell of a field which Yahweh has blessed.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,28);</script>God give you of the
dew of the sky,
<dd>of the fatness of the earth,
<dd>and plenty of grain and new wine.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,29);</script>Let peoples serve
you,
<dd>and nations bow down to you.
<dt>Be lord over your brothers.
<dd>Let your mother’s sons bow down to you.
<dt>Cursed be everyone who curses you.
<dd>Blessed be everyone who blesses you.”
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,30);</script>It happened, as soon
as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob had just gone out
from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from
his hunting. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,31);</script>He also
made savory food, and brought it to his father. He said to his father,
“Let my father arise, and eat of his son’s venison, that your soul may
bless me.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,32);</script>Isaac his father said
to him, “Who are you?”
<p>He said, “I am your son, your firstborn, Esau.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,33);</script>Isaac trembled
violently, and said, “Who, then, is he who has taken venison, and
brought it me, and I have eaten of all before you came, and have blessed
him? Yes, he will be blessed.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,34);</script>When Esau heard the
words of his father, he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry, and
said to his father, “Bless me, even me also, my father.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,35);</script>He said, “Your
brother came with deceit, and has taken away your blessing.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,36);</script>He said, “Isn’t
he rightly named Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times. He took
away my birthright. See, now he has taken away my blessing.” He said,
“Haven’t you reserved a blessing for me?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,37);</script>Isaac answered Esau,
“Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brothers have I given to
him for servants. With grain and new wine have I sustained him. What then
will I do for you, my son?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,38);</script>Esau said to his
father, “Have you but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also,
my father.” Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,39);</script>Isaac his father
answered him,
<dl>
<dt>“Behold, of the fatness of the earth will be your dwelling,
<dt>and of the dew of the sky from above.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,40);</script>By your sword will
you live, and you will serve your brother.
<dt>It will happen, when you will break loose,
<dt>that you shall shake his yoke from off your neck.”
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,41);</script>Esau hated Jacob
because of the blessing with which his father blessed him. Esau said in
his heart, “The days of mourning for my father are at hand. Then I will
kill my brother Jacob.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,42);</script>The words of Esau,
her elder son, were told to Rebekah. She sent and called Jacob, her
younger son, and said to him, “Behold, your brother Esau comforts
himself about you by planning to kill you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,43);</script>Now therefore, my son, obey my
voice. Arise, flee to Laban, my brother, in Haran. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,44);</script>Stay with him a few days, until
your brother’s fury turns away; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,45);</script>until your brother’s anger
turn away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will
send, and get you from there. Why should I be bereaved of you both in one
day?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,46);</script>Rebekah said to
Isaac, “I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob
takes a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these, of the daughters of
the land, what good will my life do me?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,1);</script>Isaac called Jacob,
blessed him, and commanded him, “You shall not take a wife of the
daughters of Canaan. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,2);</script>Arise, go to Paddan Aram, to the
house of Bethuel your mother’s father. Take a wife from there from the
daughters of Laban, your mother’s brother. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,3);</script>May God Almighty bless you, and
make you fruitful, and multiply you, that you may be a company of peoples,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(28,4);</script>and give you the blessing
of Abraham, to you, and to your seed with you, that you may inherit the
land where you travel, which God gave to Abraham.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,5);</script>Isaac sent Jacob away.
He went to Paddan Aram to Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, Rebekah’s
brother, Jacob’s and Esau’s mother.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,6);</script>Now Esau saw that
Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan Aram, to take him a
wife from there, and that as he blessed him he gave him a command, saying,
“You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan,” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,7);</script>and that Jacob obeyed his father
and his mother, and was gone to Paddan Aram. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,8);</script>Esau saw that the daughters of
Canaan didn’t please Isaac, his father. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,9);</script>Esau went to Ishmael, and took,
besides the wives that he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael,
Abraham’s son, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,10);</script>Jacob went out from
Beersheba, and went toward Haran. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,11);</script>He came to a certain place, and
stayed there all night, because the sun had set. He took one of the stones
of the place, and put it under his head, and lay down in that place to
sleep. <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,12);</script>He dreamed.
Behold, a stairway set upon the earth, and its top reached to heaven.
Behold, the angels of God ascending and descending on it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,13);</script>Behold, Yahweh stood above it,
and said, “I am Yahweh, the God of Abraham your father, and the God of
Isaac. The land whereon you lie, to you will I give it, and to your seed.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(28,14);</script>Your seed will be as the
dust of the earth, and you will spread abroad to the west, and to the
east, and to the north, and to the south. In you and in your seed will all
the families of the earth be blessed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,15);</script>Behold, I am with you, and will
keep you, wherever you go, and will bring you again into this land. For I
will not leave you, until I have done that which I have spoken of to
you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,16);</script>Jacob awakened out of
his sleep, and he said, “Surely Yahweh is in this place, and I didn’t
know it.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,17);</script>He was
afraid, and said, “How dreadful is this place! This is none other than
God’s house, and this is the gate of heaven.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,18);</script>Jacob rose up early
in the morning, and took the stone that he had put under his head, and set
it up for a pillar, and poured oil on its top. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,19);</script>He called the name of that place
Bethel, but the name of the city was Luz at the first. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,20);</script>Jacob vowed a vow, saying, “If
God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give
me bread to eat, and clothing to put on, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,21);</script>so that I come again to my
father’s house in peace, and Yahweh will be my God, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,22);</script>then this stone, which I have
set up for a pillar, will be God’s house. Of all that you will give me I
will surely give the tenth to you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,1);</script>Then Jacob went on his
journey, and came to the land of the children of the east. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,2);</script>He looked, and behold, a well in
the field, and, behold, three flocks of sheep lying there by it. For out
of that well they watered the flocks. The stone on the well’s mouth was
large. <script type="text/javascript">cb(29,3);</script>There all the
flocks were gathered. They rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and
watered the sheep, and put the stone again on the well’s mouth in its
place. <script type="text/javascript">cb(29,4);</script>Jacob said to
them, “My relatives, where are you from?”
<p>They said, “We are from Haran.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,5);</script>He said to them, “Do
you know Laban, the son of Nahor?”
<p>They said, “We know him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,6);</script>He said to them, “Is
it well with him?”
<p>They said, “It is well. See, Rachel, his daughter, is coming with the
sheep.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,7);</script>He said, “Behold, it
is still the middle of the day, not time to gather the livestock together.
Water the sheep, and go and feed them.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,8);</script>They said, “We
can’t, until all the flocks are gathered together, and they roll the
stone from the well’s mouth. Then we water the sheep.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,9);</script>While he was yet
speaking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep, for she kept
them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(29,10);</script>It happened, when
Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban, his mother’s brother, and the
sheep of Laban, his mother’s brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled
the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his
mother’s brother. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,11);</script>Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted
up his voice, and wept. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,12);</script>Jacob told Rachel that he was
her father’s brother, and that he was Rebekah’s son. She ran and told
her father.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,13);</script>It happened, when
Laban heard the news of Jacob, his sister’s son, that he ran to meet
Jacob, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house.
Jacob told Laban all these things. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,14);</script>Laban said to him, “Surely you
are my bone and my flesh.” He lived with him for a month. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,15);</script>Laban said to Jacob, “Because
you are my brother, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me,
what will your wages be?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,16);</script>Laban had two
daughters. The name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was
Rachel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(29,17);</script>Leah’s eyes
were weak, but Rachel was beautiful in form and attractive. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,18);</script>Jacob loved Rachel. He said,
“I will serve you seven years for Rachel, your younger daughter.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,19);</script>Laban said, “It is
better that I give her to you, than that I should give her to another man.
Stay with me.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,20);</script>Jacob served seven
years for Rachel. They seemed to him but a few days, for the love he had
for her.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,21);</script>Jacob said to Laban,
“Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to her.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,22);</script>Laban gathered
together all the men of the place, and made a feast. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,23);</script>It happened in the evening, that
he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him. He went in to her.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(29,24);</script>Laban gave Zilpah his
handmaid to his daughter Leah for a handmaid. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,25);</script>It happened in the morning that,
behold, it was Leah. He said to Laban, “What is this you have done to
me? Didn’t I serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,26);</script>Laban said, “It is
not done so in our place, to give the younger before the firstborn.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(29,27);</script>Fulfill the week of this
one, and we will give you the other also for the service which you will
serve with me yet seven other years.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,28);</script>Jacob did so, and
fulfilled her week. He gave him Rachel his daughter as wife. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,29);</script>Laban gave to Rachel his
daughter Bilhah, his handmaid, to be her handmaid. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,30);</script>He went in also to Rachel, and
he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other
years.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,31);</script>Yahweh saw that Leah
was hated, and he opened her womb, but Rachel was barren. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,32);</script>Leah conceived, and bore a son,
and she named him Reuben. For she said, “Because Yahweh has looked at my
affliction. For now my husband will love me.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,33);</script>She conceived again, and bore a
son, and said, “Because Yahweh has heard that I am hated, he has
therefore given me this son also.” She named him Simeon. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,34);</script>She conceived again, and bore a
son. Said, “Now this time will my husband be joined to me, because I
have borne him three sons.” Therefore his name was called Levi. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,35);</script>She conceived again, and bore a
son. She said, “This time will I praise Yahweh.” Therefore she named
him Judah. Then she stopped bearing.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,1);</script>When Rachel saw that
she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister. She said to Jacob,
“Give me children, or else I will die.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,2);</script>Jacob’s anger was
kindled against Rachel, and he said, “Am I in God’s place, who has
withheld from you the fruit of the womb?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,3);</script>She said, “Behold,
my maid Bilhah. Go in to her, that she may bear on my knees, and I also
may obtain children by her.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,4);</script>She gave him Bilhah her handmaid
as wife, and Jacob went in to her. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,5);</script>Bilhah conceived, and bore Jacob
a son. <script type="text/javascript">cb(30,6);</script>Rachel said,
“God has judged me, and has also heard my voice, and has given me a
son.” Therefore called she his name Dan. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,7);</script>Bilhah, Rachel’s handmaid,
conceived again, and bore Jacob a second son. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,8);</script>Rachel said, “With mighty
wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and have prevailed.” She
named him Naphtali.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,9);</script>When Leah saw that she
had finished bearing, she took Zilpah, her handmaid, and gave her to Jacob
as a wife. <script type="text/javascript">cb(30,10);</script>Zilpah,
Leah’s handmaid, bore Jacob a son. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,11);</script>Leah said, “How fortunate!”
She named him Gad. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,12);</script>Zilpah, Leah’s handmaid, bore
Jacob a second son. <script type="text/javascript">cb(30,13);</script>Leah
said, “Happy am I, for the daughters will call me happy.” She named
him Asher.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,14);</script>Reuben went in the
days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them
to his mother, Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, “Please give me some of
your son’s mandrakes.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,15);</script>She said to her,
“Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband? Would you
take away my son’s mandrakes, also?”
<p>Rachel said, “Therefore he will lie with you tonight for your son’s
mandrakes.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,16);</script>Jacob came from the
field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, “You must
come in to me; for I have surely hired you with my son’s mandrakes.”
<p>He lay with her that night. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,17);</script>God listened to Leah, and she
conceived, and bore Jacob a fifth son. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,18);</script>Leah said, “God has given me
my hire, because I gave my handmaid to my husband.” She named him
Issachar. <script type="text/javascript">cb(30,19);</script>Leah conceived
again, and bore a sixth son to Jacob. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,20);</script>Leah said, “God has endowed me
with a good dowry. Now my husband will live with me, because I have borne
him six sons.” She named him Zebulun. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,21);</script>Afterwards, she bore a daughter,
and named her Dinah.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,22);</script>God remembered
Rachel, and God listened to her, and opened her womb. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,23);</script>She conceived, bore a son, and
said, “God has taken away my reproach.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,24);</script>She named him <a
href="#N15">Joseph,</a> saying, “May Yahweh add another son to me.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,25);</script>It happened, when
Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, “Send me away, that I
may go to my own place, and to my country. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,26);</script>Give me my wives and my children
for whom I have served you, and let me go; for you know my service with
which I have served you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,27);</script>Laban said to him,
“If now I have found favor in your eyes, stay here, for I have divined
that Yahweh has blessed me for your sake.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,28);</script>He said, “Appoint me your
wages, and I will give it.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,29);</script>He said to him,
“You know how I have served you, and how your livestock have fared with
me. <script type="text/javascript">cb(30,30);</script>For it was little
which you had before I came, and it has increased to a multitude. Yahweh
has blessed you wherever I turned. Now when will I provide for my own
house also?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,31);</script>He said, “What
shall I give you?”
<p>Jacob said, “You shall not give me anything. If you will do this
thing for me, I will again feed your flock and keep it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,32);</script>I will pass through all your
flock today, removing from there every speckled and spotted one, and every
black one among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats.
This will be my hire. <script type="text/javascript">cb(30,33);</script>So
my righteousness will answer for me hereafter, when you come concerning my
hire that is before you. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among
the goats, and black among the sheep, that might be with me, will be
counted stolen.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,34);</script>Laban said,
“Behold, let it be according to your word.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,35);</script>That day, he removed
the male goats that were streaked and spotted, and all the female goats
that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all
the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(30,36);</script>He set three days’
journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s
flocks.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,37);</script>Jacob took to himself
rods of fresh poplar, almond, plane tree, peeled white streaks in them,
and made the white appear which was in the rods. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,38);</script>He set the rods which he had
peeled opposite the flocks in the gutters in the watering-troughs where
the flocks came to drink. They conceived when they came to drink. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,39);</script>The flocks conceived before the
rods, and the flocks produced streaked, speckled, and spotted. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,40);</script>Jacob separated the lambs, and
set the faces of the flocks toward the streaked and all the black in the
flock of Laban: and he put his own droves apart, and didn’t put them
into Laban’s flock. <script type="text/javascript">cb(30,41);</script>It
happened, whenever the stronger of the flock conceived, that Jacob laid
the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might
conceive among the rods; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,42);</script>but when the flock were feeble,
he didn’t put them in. So the feebler were Laban’s, and the stronger
Jacob’s. <script type="text/javascript">cb(30,43);</script>The man
increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, female servants and male
servants, and camels and donkeys.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,1);</script>He heard the words of
Laban’s sons, saying, “Jacob has taken away all that was our
father’s. From that which was our father’s, has he gotten all this
wealth.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(31,2);</script>Jacob saw the
expression on Laban’s face, and, behold, it was not toward him as
before. <script type="text/javascript">cb(31,3);</script>Yahweh said to
Jacob, “Return to the land of your fathers, and to your relatives, and I
will be with you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,4);</script>Jacob sent and called
Rachel and Leah to the field to his flock, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,5);</script>and said to them, “I see the
expression on your father’s face, that it is not toward me as before;
but the God of my father has been with me. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,6);</script>You know that I have served your
father with all of my strength. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,7);</script>Your father has deceived me, and
changed my wages ten times, but God didn’t allow him to hurt me. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,8);</script>If he said this, ‘The speckled
will be your wages,’ then all the flock bore speckled. If he said this,
‘The streaked will be your wages,’ then all the flock bore streaked.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(31,9);</script>Thus God has taken away
your father’s livestock, and given them to me. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,10);</script>It happened during mating season
that I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and behold, the male goats
which leaped on the flock were streaked, speckled, and grizzled. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,11);</script>The angel of God said to me in
the dream, ‘Jacob,’ and I said, ‘Here I am.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,12);</script>He said, ‘Now lift up your
eyes, and behold, all the male goats which leap on the flock are streaked,
speckled, and grizzled, for I have seen all that Laban does to you.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(31,13);</script>I am the God of Bethel,
where you anointed a pillar, where you vowed a vow to me. Now arise, get
out from this land, and return to the land of your birth.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,14);</script>Rachel and Leah
answered him, “Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our
father’s house? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,15);</script>Aren’t we accounted by him as
foreigners? For he has sold us, and has also quite devoured our money.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(31,16);</script>For all the riches which
God has taken away from our father, that is ours and our children’s. Now
then, whatever God has said to you, do.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,17);</script>Then Jacob rose up,
and set his sons and his wives on the camels, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,18);</script>and he took away all his
livestock, and all his possessions which he had gathered, including the
livestock which he had gained in Paddan Aram, to go to Isaac his father,
to the land of Canaan. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,19);</script>Now Laban had gone to shear his
sheep: and Rachel stole the <a href="#N16">teraphim</a> that were her
father’s.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,20);</script>Jacob deceived Laban
the Syrian, in that he didn’t tell him that he was running away. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,21);</script>So he fled with all that he had.
He rose up, passed over the River, and set his face toward the mountain of
Gilead.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,22);</script>Laban was told on the
third day that Jacob had fled. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,23);</script>He took his relatives with him,
and pursued after him seven days’ journey. He overtook him in the
mountain of Gilead. <script type="text/javascript">cb(31,24);</script>God
came to Laban, the Syrian, in a dream of the night, and said to him,
“Take heed to yourself that you don’t speak to Jacob either good or
bad.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,25);</script>Laban caught up with
Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain, and Laban with his
relatives encamped in the mountain of Gilead. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,26);</script>Laban said to Jacob, “What
have you done, that you have deceived me, and carried away my daughters
like captives of the sword? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,27);</script>Why did you flee secretly, and
deceive me, and didn’t tell me, that I might have sent you away with
mirth and with songs, with tambourine and with harp; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,28);</script>and didn’t allow me to kiss my
sons and my daughters? Now have you done foolishly. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,29);</script>It is in the power of my hand to
hurt you, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying,
‘Take heed to yourself that you don’t speak to Jacob either good or
bad.’ <script type="text/javascript">cb(31,30);</script>Now, you want to
be gone, because you greatly longed for your father’s house, but why
have you stolen my gods?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,31);</script>Jacob answered Laban,
“Because I was afraid, for I said, ‘Lest you should take your
daughters from me by force.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,32);</script>Anyone you find your gods with
shall not live. Before our relatives, discern what is yours with me, and
take it.” For Jacob didn’t know that Rachel had stolen them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,33);</script>Laban went into
Jacob’s tent, into Leah’s tent, and into the tent of the two female
servants; but he didn’t find them. He went out of Leah’s tent, and
entered into Rachel’s tent. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,34);</script>Now Rachel had taken the
teraphim, put them in the camel’s saddle, and sat on them. Laban felt
about all the tent, but didn’t find them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,35);</script>She said to her father,
“Don’t let my lord be angry that I can’t rise up before you; for
I’m having my period.” He searched, but didn’t find the teraphim.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,36);</script>Jacob was angry, and
argued with Laban. Jacob answered Laban, “What is my trespass? What is
my sin, that you have hotly pursued after me? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,37);</script>Now that you have felt around in
all my stuff, what have you found of all your household stuff? Set it here
before my relatives and your relatives, that they may judge between us two.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,38);</script>“These twenty years
I have been with you. Your ewes and your female goats have not cast their
young, and I haven’t eaten the rams of your flocks. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,39);</script>That which was torn of animals,
I didn’t bring to you. I bore its loss. Of my hand you required it,
whether stolen by day or stolen by night. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,40);</script>This was my situation: in the
day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled
from my eyes. <script type="text/javascript">cb(31,41);</script>These
twenty years I have been in your house. I served you fourteen years for
your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my
wages ten times. <script type="text/javascript">cb(31,42);</script>Unless
the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been
with me, surely now you would have sent me away empty. God has seen my
affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked you last night.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,43);</script>Laban answered Jacob,
“The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, the
flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine: and what can I do this
day to these my daughters, or to their children whom they have borne?
<script type="text/javascript">cb(31,44);</script>Now come, let us make a
covenant, you and I; and let it be for a witness between me and you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,45);</script>Jacob took a stone,
and set it up for a pillar. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,46);</script>Jacob said to his relatives,
“Gather stones.” They took stones, and made a heap. They ate there by
the heap. <script type="text/javascript">cb(31,47);</script>Laban called
it <a href="#N17">Jegar Sahadutha,</a> but Jacob called it <a
href="#N18">Galeed.</a> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,48);</script>Laban said, “This heap is
witness between me and you this day.” Therefore it was named Galeed
<script type="text/javascript">cb(31,49);</script>and Mizpah, for he said,
“Yahweh watch between me and you, when we are absent one from another.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(31,50);</script>If you afflict my
daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, no man is with us;
behold, God is witness between me and you.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,51);</script>Laban said to Jacob, “See this
heap, and see the pillar, which I have set between me and you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,52);</script>May this heap be a witness, and
the pillar be a witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and
that you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(31,53);</script>The God of Abraham, and
the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.” Then Jacob
swore by the fear of his father, Isaac. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,54);</script>Jacob offered a sacrifice in the
mountain, and called his relatives to eat bread. They ate bread, and
stayed all night in the mountain. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(31,55);</script>Early in the morning, Laban rose
up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them. Laban
departed and returned to his place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,1);</script>Jacob went on his way,
and the angels of God met him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(32,2);</script>When he saw them, Jacob said,
“This is God’s army.” He called the name of that place Mahanaim.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,3);</script>Jacob sent messengers
in front of him to Esau, his brother, to the land of Seir, the field of
Edom. <script type="text/javascript">cb(32,4);</script>He commanded them,
saying, “This is what you shall tell my lord, Esau: ‘This is what your
servant, Jacob, says. I have lived as a foreigner with Laban, and stayed
until now. <script type="text/javascript">cb(32,5);</script>I have cattle,
donkeys, flocks, male servants, and female servants. I have sent to tell
my lord, that I may find favor in your sight.’” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(32,6);</script>The messengers returned to Jacob,
saying, “We came to your brother Esau. Not only that, but he comes to
meet you, and four hundred men with him.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(32,7);</script>Then Jacob was greatly afraid and
was distressed. He divided the people who were with him, and the flocks,
and the herds, and the camels, into two companies; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(32,8);</script>and he said, “If Esau comes to
the one company, and strikes it, then the company which is left will
escape.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(32,9);</script>Jacob said,
“God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, Yahweh, who said
to me, ‘Return to your country, and to your relatives, and I will do you
good,’ <script type="text/javascript">cb(32,10);</script>I am not worthy
of the least of all the loving kindnesses, and of all the truth, which you
have shown to your servant; for with just my staff I passed over this
Jordan; and now I have become two companies. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(32,11);</script>Please deliver me from the hand
of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he come and
strike me, and the mothers with the children. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(32,12);</script>You said, ‘I will surely do
you good, and make your seed as the sand of the sea, which can’t be
numbered because there are so many.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,13);</script>He lodged there that
night, and took from that which he had with him, a present for Esau, his
brother: <script type="text/javascript">cb(32,14);</script>two hundred
female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(32,15);</script>thirty milk camels and
their colts, forty cows, ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten foals.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(32,16);</script>He delivered them into
the hands of his servants, every herd by itself, and said to his servants,
“Pass over before me, and put a space between herd and herd.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(32,17);</script>He commanded the foremost,
saying, “When Esau, my brother, meets you, and asks you, saying,
‘Whose are you? Where are you going? Whose are these before you?’
<script type="text/javascript">cb(32,18);</script>Then you shall say,
‘They are your servant, Jacob’s. It is a present sent to my lord,
Esau. Behold, he also is behind us.’” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(32,19);</script>He commanded also the second,
and the third, and all that followed the herds, saying, “This is how you
shall speak to Esau, when you find him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(32,20);</script>You shall say, ‘Not only that,
but behold, your servant, Jacob, is behind us.’” For, he said, “I
will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I
will see his face. Perhaps he will accept me.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,21);</script>So the present passed
over before him, and he himself lodged that night in the camp.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,22);</script>He rose up that
night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven sons,
and passed over the ford of the Jabbok. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(32,23);</script>He took them, and sent them over
the stream, and sent over that which he had. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(32,24);</script>Jacob was left alone, and
wrestled with a man there until the breaking of the day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(32,25);</script>When he saw that he didn’t
prevail against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh, and the hollow of
Jacob’s thigh was strained, as he wrestled. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(32,26);</script>The man said, “Let me go, for
the day breaks.”
<p>Jacob said, “I won’t let you go, unless you bless me.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,27);</script>He said to him,
“What is your name?”
<p>He said, “Jacob.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(32,28);</script>He said, “Your name will no
longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have fought with God and with
men, and have prevailed.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,29);</script>Jacob asked him,
“Please tell me your name.”
<p>He said, “Why is it that you ask what my name is?” He blessed him
there.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(32,30);</script>Jacob called the name
of the place <a href="#N19">Peniel</a>: for, he said, “I have seen God
face to face, and my life is preserved.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(32,31);</script>The sun rose on him as he passed
over Peniel, and he limped because of his thigh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(32,32);</script>Therefore the children of Israel
don’t eat the sinew of the hip, which is on the hollow of the thigh, to
this day, because he touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew of
the hip.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,1);</script>Jacob lifted up his
eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau was coming, and with him four hundred
men. He divided the children between Leah, Rachel, and the two handmaids.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(33,2);</script>He put the handmaids and
their children in front, Leah and her children after, and Rachel and
Joseph at the rear. <script type="text/javascript">cb(33,3);</script>He
himself passed over in front of them, and bowed himself to the ground
seven times, until he came near to his brother.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,4);</script>Esau ran to meet him,
embraced him, fell on his neck, kissed him, and they wept. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(33,5);</script>He lifted up his eyes, and saw
the women and the children; and said, “Who are these with you?”
<p>He said, “The children whom God has graciously given your servant.”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(33,6);</script>Then the handmaids came
near with their children, and they bowed themselves. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(33,7);</script>Leah also and her children came
near, and bowed themselves. After them, Joseph came near with Rachel, and
they bowed themselves.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,8);</script>Esau said, “What do
you mean by all this company which I met?”
<p>Jacob said, “To find favor in the sight of my lord.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,9);</script>Esau said, “I have
enough, my brother; let that which you have be yours.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,10);</script>Jacob said,
“Please, no, if I have now found favor in your sight, then receive my
present at my hand, because I have seen your face, as one sees the face of
God, and you were pleased with me. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(33,11);</script>Please take the gift that I
brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I
have enough.” He urged him, and he took it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,12);</script>Esau said, “Let us
take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,13);</script>Jacob said to him,
“My lord knows that the children are tender, and that the flocks and
herds with me have their young, and if they overdrive them one day, all
the flocks will die. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(33,14);</script>Please let my lord pass over
before his servant, and I will lead on gently, according to the pace of
the livestock that are before me and according to the pace of the
children, until I come to my lord to Seir.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,15);</script>Esau said, “Let me
now leave with you some of the folk who are with me.”
<p>He said, “Why? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,16);</script>So Esau returned that
day on his way to Seir. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(33,17);</script>Jacob traveled to Succoth, built
himself a house, and made shelters for his livestock. Therefore the name
of the place is called <a href="#N20">Succoth.</a>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,18);</script>Jacob came in peace
to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from
Paddan Aram; and encamped before the city. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(33,19);</script>He bought the parcel of ground
where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor,
Shechem’s father, for one hundred pieces of money. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(33,20);</script>He erected an altar there, and
called it <a href="#N21">El Elohe Israel.</a>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,1);</script>Dinah, the daughter of
Leah, whom she bore to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(34,2);</script>Shechem the son of Hamor
the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her. He took her, lay with her,
and humbled her. <script type="text/javascript">cb(34,3);</script>His soul
joined to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the young lady, and
spoke kindly to the young lady. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(34,4);</script>Shechem spoke to his father,
Hamor, saying, “Get me this young lady as a wife.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,5);</script>Now Jacob heard that
he had defiled Dinah, his daughter; and his sons were with his livestock
in the field. Jacob held his peace until they came. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(34,6);</script>Hamor the father of Shechem went
out to Jacob to talk with him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(34,7);</script>The sons of Jacob came in from
the field when they heard it. The men were grieved, and they were very
angry, because he had done folly in Israel in lying with Jacob’s
daughter; a which thing ought not to be done. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(34,8);</script>Hamor talked with them, saying,
“The soul of my son, Shechem, longs for your daughter. Please give her
to him as a wife. <script type="text/javascript">cb(34,9);</script>Make
marriages with us. Give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for
yourselves. <script type="text/javascript">cb(34,10);</script>You shall
dwell with us, and the land will be before you. Live and trade in it, and
get possessions in it.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,11);</script>Shechem said to her
father and to her brothers, “Let me find favor in your eyes, and
whatever you will tell me I will give. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(34,12);</script>Ask me a great amount for a
dowry, and I will give whatever you ask of me, but give me the young lady
as a wife.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,13);</script>The sons of Jacob
answered Shechem and Hamor his father with deceit, and spoke, because he
had defiled Dinah their sister, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(34,14);</script>and said to them, “We can’t
do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised; for that is
a reproach to us. <script type="text/javascript">cb(34,15);</script>Only
on this condition will we consent to you. If you will be as we are, that
every male of you be circumcised; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(34,16);</script>then will we give our daughters
to you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you,
and we will become one people. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(34,17);</script>But if you will not listen to
us, to be circumcised, then we will take our <a href="#N22">sister,</a>
and we will be gone.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,18);</script>Their words pleased
Hamor and Shechem, Hamor’s son. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(34,19);</script>The young man didn’t wait to
do this thing, because he had delight in Jacob’s daughter, and he was
honored above all the house of his father. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(34,20);</script>Hamor and Shechem, his son, came
to the gate of their city, and talked with the men of their city, saying,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(34,21);</script>“These men are
peaceful with us. Therefore let them live in the land and trade in it. For
behold, the land is large enough for them. Let us take their daughters to
us for wives, and let us give them our daughters. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(34,22);</script>Only on this condition will the
men consent to us to live with us, to become one people, if every male
among us is circumcised, as they are circumcised. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(34,23);</script>Won’t their livestock and
their possessions and all their animals be ours? Only let us give our
consent to them, and they will dwell with us.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,24);</script>All who went out of
the gate of his city listened to Hamor, and to Shechem his son; and every
male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(34,25);</script>It happened on the third day,
when they were sore, that two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon and Levi,
Dinah’s brothers, each took his sword, came upon the unsuspecting city,
and killed all the males. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(34,26);</script>They killed Hamor and Shechem,
his son, with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem’s
house, and went away. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(34,27);</script>Jacob’s sons came on the dead,
and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(34,28);</script>They took their flocks, their
herds, their donkeys, that which was in the city, that which was in the
field, <script type="text/javascript">cb(34,29);</script>and all their
wealth. They took captive all their little ones and their wives, and took
as plunder everything that was in the house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(34,30);</script>Jacob said to Simeon and Levi,
“You have troubled me, to make me odious to the inhabitants of the land,
among the Canaanites and the Perizzites. I am few in number. They will
gather themselves together against me and strike me, and I will be
destroyed, I and my house.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,31);</script>They said, “Should
he deal with our sister as with a prostitute?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,1);</script>God said to Jacob,
“Arise, go up to Bethel, and live there. Make there an altar to God, who
appeared to you when you fled from the face of Esau your brother.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,2);</script>Then Jacob said to his
household, and to all who were with him, “Put away the foreign gods that
are among you, purify yourselves, change your garments. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(35,3);</script>Let us arise, and go up to
Bethel. I will make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of
my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,4);</script>They gave to Jacob all
the foreign gods which were in their hands, and the rings which were in
their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(35,5);</script>They traveled, and a terror of
God was on the cities that were around them, and they didn’t pursue the
sons of Jacob. <script type="text/javascript">cb(35,6);</script>So Jacob
came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all
the people who were with him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(35,7);</script>He built an altar there, and
called the place El Beth El; because there God was revealed to him, when
he fled from the face of his brother. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(35,8);</script>Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died,
and she was buried below Bethel under the oak; and its name was called
Allon Bacuth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,9);</script>God appeared to Jacob
again, when he came from Paddan Aram, and blessed him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(35,10);</script>God said to him, “Your name is
Jacob. Your name shall not be Jacob any more, but your name will be
Israel.” He named him Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(35,11);</script>God said to him, “I am God
Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a company of nations will
be from you, and kings will come out of your body. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(35,12);</script>The land which I gave to Abraham
and Isaac, I will give it to you, and to your seed after you will I give
the land.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,13);</script>God went up from him
in the place where he spoke with him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(35,14);</script>Jacob set up a pillar in the
place where he spoke with him, a pillar of stone. He poured out a drink
offering on it, and poured oil on it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(35,15);</script>Jacob called the name of the
place where God spoke with him “Bethel.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,16);</script>They traveled from
Bethel. There was still some distance to come to Ephrath, and Rachel
travailed. She had hard labor. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(35,17);</script>When she was in hard labor, the
midwife said to her, “Don’t be afraid, for now you will have another
son.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,18);</script>It happened, as her
soul was departing (for she died), that she named him <a
href="#N23">Benoni,</a> but his father named him <a
href="#N24">Benjamin.</a> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(35,19);</script>Rachel died, and was buried in
the way to Ephrath (the same is Bethlehem). <script
type="text/javascript">cb(35,20);</script>Jacob set up a pillar on her
grave. The same is the Pillar of Rachel’s grave to this day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(35,21);</script>Israel traveled, and spread his
tent beyond the tower of Eder. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(35,22);</script>It happened, while Israel lived
in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah, his father’s
concubine, and Israel heard of it.
<p>Now the sons of Jacob were twelve. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(35,23);</script>The sons of Leah: Reuben
(Jacob’s firstborn), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(35,24);</script>The sons of Rachel: Joseph and
Benjamin. <script type="text/javascript">cb(35,25);</script>The sons of
Bilhah (Rachel’s handmaid): Dan and Naphtali. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(35,26);</script>The sons of Zilpah (Leah’s
handmaid): Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob, who were born to
him in Paddan Aram. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(35,27);</script>Jacob came to Isaac his father,
to Mamre, to Kiriath Arba (which is Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac lived
as foreigners.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,28);</script>The days of Isaac
were one hundred eighty years. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(35,29);</script>Isaac gave up the spirit, and
died, and was gathered to his people, old and full of days. Esau and
Jacob, his sons, buried him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,1);</script>Now this is the
history of the generations of Esau (that is, Edom). <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,2);</script>Esau took his wives from the
daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon, the Hittite; and
Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon, the Hivite;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(36,3);</script>and Basemath, Ishmael’s
daughter, sister of Nebaioth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,4);</script>Adah bore to Esau Eliphaz.
Basemath bore Reuel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,5);</script>Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam, and
Korah. These are the sons of Esau, who were born to him in the land of
Canaan. <script type="text/javascript">cb(36,6);</script>Esau took his
wives, his sons, his daughters, and all the members of his household, with
his livestock, all his animals, and all his possessions, which he had
gathered in the land of Canaan, and went into a land away from his brother
Jacob. <script type="text/javascript">cb(36,7);</script>For their
substance was too great for them to dwell together, and the land of their
travels couldn’t bear them because of their livestock. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,8);</script>Esau lived in the hill country of
Seir. Esau is Edom.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,9);</script>This is the history of
the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in the hill country of
Seir: <script type="text/javascript">cb(36,10);</script>these are the
names of Esau’s sons: Eliphaz, the son of Adah, the wife of Esau; and
Reuel, the son of Basemath, the wife of Esau. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,11);</script>The sons of Eliphaz were Teman,
Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,12);</script>Timna was concubine to Eliphaz,
Esau’s son; and she bore to Eliphaz Amalek. These are the sons of Adah,
Esau’s wife. <script type="text/javascript">cb(36,13);</script>These are
the sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These were the sons
of Basemath, Esau’s wife. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,14);</script>These were the sons of
Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon, Esau’s wife:
she bore to Esau Jeush, Jalam, and Korah.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,15);</script>These are the chiefs
of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn of Esau: chief
Teman, chief Omar, chief Zepho, chief Kenaz, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,16);</script>chief Korah, chief Gatam, chief
Amalek: these are the chiefs who came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom;
these are the sons of Adah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,17);</script>These are the sons of Reuel,
Esau’s son: chief Nahath, chief Zerah, chief Shammah, chief Mizzah:
these are the chiefs who came of Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the
sons of Basemath, Esau’s wife. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,18);</script>These are the sons of
Oholibamah, Esau’s wife: chief Jeush, chief Jalam, chief Korah: these
are the chiefs who came of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau’s wife.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(36,19);</script>These are the sons of
Esau (that is, Edom), and these are their chiefs.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,20);</script>These are the sons of
Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(36,21);</script>Dishon, Ezer, and
Dishan. These are the chiefs who came of the Horites, the children of Seir
in the land of Edom. <script type="text/javascript">cb(36,22);</script>The
children of Lotan were Hori and Heman. Lotan’s sister was Timna. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,23);</script>These are the children of
Shobal: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,24);</script>These are the children of
Zibeon: Aiah and Anah. This is Anah who found the hot springs in the
wilderness, as he fed the donkeys of Zibeon his father. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,25);</script>These are the children of Anah:
Dishon and Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,26);</script>These are the children of
Dishon: Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,27);</script>These are the children of Ezer:
Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,28);</script>These are the children of
Dishan: Uz and Aran. <script

the Horites: chief Lotan, chief Shobal, chief Zibeon, chief Anah, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,30);</script>chief Dishon, chief Ezer, and
chief Dishan: these are the chiefs who came of the Horites, according to
their chiefs in the land of Seir.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,31);</script>These are the kings
who reigned in the land of Edom, before any king reigned over the children
of Israel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(36,32);</script>Bela, the son
of Beor, reigned in Edom. The name of his city was Dinhabah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,33);</script>Bela died, and Jobab, the son of
Zerah of Bozrah, reigned in his place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,34);</script>Jobab died, and Husham of the
land of the Temanites reigned in his place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,35);</script>Husham died, and Hadad, the son
of Bedad, who struck Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his place.
The name of his city was Avith. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,36);</script>Hadad died, and Samlah of
Masrekah reigned in his place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,37);</script>Samlah died, and Shaul of
Rehoboth by the river, reigned in his place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,38);</script>Shaul died, and Baal Hanan, the
son of Achbor reigned in his place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,39);</script>Baal Hanan the son of Achbor
died, and Hadar reigned in his place. The name of his city was Pau. His
wife’s name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of
Mezahab.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,40);</script>These are the names
of the chiefs who came from Esau, according to their families, after their
places, and by their names: chief Timna, chief Alvah, chief Jetheth,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(36,41);</script>chief Oholibamah, chief
Elah, chief Pinon, <script type="text/javascript">cb(36,42);</script>chief
Kenaz, chief Teman, chief Mibzar, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,43);</script>chief Magdiel, and chief Iram.
These are the chiefs of Edom, according to their habitations in the land
of their possession. This is Esau, the father of the Edomites.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,1);</script>Jacob lived in the
land of his father’s travels, in the land of Canaan. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(37,2);</script>This is the history of the
generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the
flock with his brothers. He was a boy with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah,
his father’s wives. Joseph brought an evil report of them to their
father. <script type="text/javascript">cb(37,3);</script>Now Israel loved
Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age,
and he made him a coat of many colors. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(37,4);</script>His brothers saw that their
father loved him more than all his brothers, and they hated him, and
couldn’t speak peaceably to him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,5);</script>Joseph dreamed a
dream, and he told it to his brothers, and they hated him all the more.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(37,6);</script>He said to them,
“Please hear this dream which I have dreamed: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(37,7);</script>for behold, we were binding
sheaves in the field, and behold, my sheaf arose and also stood upright;
and behold, your sheaves came around, and bowed down to my sheaf.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,8);</script>His brothers said to
him, “Will you indeed reign over us? Or will you indeed have dominion
over us?” They hated him all the more for his dreams and for his words.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(37,9);</script>He dreamed yet another
dream, and told it to his brothers, and said, “Behold, I have dreamed
yet another dream: and behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed
down to me.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(37,10);</script>He told
it to his father and to his brothers. His father rebuked him, and said to
him, “What is this dream that you have dreamed? Will I and your mother
and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves down to you to the
earth?” <script type="text/javascript">cb(37,11);</script>His brothers
envied him, but his father kept this saying in mind.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,12);</script>His brothers went to
feed their father’s flock in Shechem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(37,13);</script>Israel said to Joseph,
“Aren’t your brothers feeding the flock in Shechem? Come, and I will
send you to them.” He said to him, “Here I am.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,14);</script>He said to him, “Go
now, see whether it is well with your brothers, and well with the flock;
and bring me word again.” So he sent him out of the valley of Hebron,
and he came to Shechem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(37,15);</script>A certain man found him, and
behold, he was wandering in the field. The man asked him, “What are you
looking for?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,16);</script>He said, “I am
looking for my brothers. Tell me, please, where they are feeding the
flock.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,17);</script>The man said, “They
have left here, for I heard them say, ‘Let us go to Dothan.’”
<p>Joseph went after his brothers, and found them in Dothan. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(37,18);</script>They saw him afar off, and
before he came near to them, they conspired against him to kill him.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(37,19);</script>They said one to
another, “Behold, this dreamer comes. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(37,20);</script>Come now therefore, and let’s
kill him, and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say, ‘An evil
animal has devoured him.’ We will see what will become of his dreams.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,21);</script>Reuben heard it, and
delivered him out of their hand, and said, “Let’s not take his
life.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(37,22);</script>Reuben said to
them, “Shed no blood. Throw him into this pit that is in the wilderness,
but lay no hand on him”—that he might deliver him out of their hand,
to restore him to his father. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(37,23);</script>It happened, when Joseph came to
his brothers, that they stripped Joseph of his coat, the coat of many
colors that was on him; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(37,24);</script>and they took him, and threw him
into the pit. The pit was empty. There was no water in it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,25);</script>They sat down to eat
bread, and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and saw a caravan of
Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing spices and
balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(37,26);</script>Judah said to his brothers,
“What profit is it if we kill our brother and conceal his blood? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(37,27);</script>Come, and let’s sell him to
the Ishmaelites, and not let our hand be on him; for he is our brother,
our flesh.” His brothers listened to him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(37,28);</script>Midianites who were merchants
passed by, and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold
Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. They brought Joseph
into Egypt.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,29);</script>Reuben returned to
the pit; and saw that Joseph wasn’t in the pit; and he tore his clothes.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(37,30);</script>He returned to his
brothers, and said, “The child is no more; and I, where will I go?”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(37,31);</script>They took Joseph’s
coat, and killed a male goat, and dipped the coat in the blood. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(37,32);</script>They took the coat of many
colors, and they brought it to their father, and said, “We have found
this. Examine it, now, whether it is your son’s coat or not.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,33);</script>He recognized it, and
said, “It is my son’s coat. An evil animal has devoured him. Joseph is
without doubt torn in pieces.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(37,34);</script>Jacob tore his clothes, and put
sackcloth on his waist, and mourned for his son many days. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(37,35);</script>All his sons and all his
daughters rose up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. He said,
“For I will go down to <a href="#N25">Sheol</a> to my son mourning.”
His father wept for him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(37,36);</script>The Midianites sold him into
Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s, the captain of the guard.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,1);</script>It happened at that
time, that Judah went down from his brothers, and visited a certain
Adullamite, whose name was Hirah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(38,2);</script>Judah saw there a daughter of a
certain Canaanite whose name was Shua. He took her, and went in to her.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(38,3);</script>She conceived, and bore a
son; and he named him Er. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(38,4);</script>She conceived again, and bore a
son; and she named him Onan. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(38,5);</script>She yet again bore a son, and
named him Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bore him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(38,6);</script>Judah took a wife for Er, his
firstborn, and her name was Tamar. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(38,7);</script>Er, Judah’s firstborn, was
wicked in the sight of Yahweh. Yahweh killed him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(38,8);</script>Judah said to Onan, “Go in to
your brother’s wife, and perform the duty of a husband’s brother to
her, and raise up seed to your brother.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(38,9);</script>Onan knew that the seed
wouldn’t be his; and it happened, when he went in to his brother’s
wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest he should give seed to his
brother. <script type="text/javascript">cb(38,10);</script>The thing which
he did was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and he killed him also. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(38,11);</script>Then Judah said to Tamar, his
daughter-in-law, “Remain a widow in your father’s house, until Shelah,
my son, is grown up”; for he said, “Lest he also die, like his
brothers.” Tamar went and lived in her father’s house.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,12);</script>After many days,
Shua’s daughter, the wife of Judah, died. Judah was comforted, and went
up to his sheepshearers to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah, the
Adullamite. <script type="text/javascript">cb(38,13);</script>It was told
Tamar, saying, “Behold, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to
shear his sheep.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(38,14);</script>She
took off of her the garments of her widowhood, and covered herself with
her veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the gate of Enaim, which is by
the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she wasn’t
given to him as a wife. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(38,15);</script>When Judah saw her, he thought
that she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(38,16);</script>He turned to her by the way, and
said, “Please come, let me come in to you,” for he didn’t know that
she was his daughter-in-law.
<p>She said, “What will you give me, that you may come in to me?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,17);</script>He said, “I will
send you a young goat from the flock.”
<p>She said, “Will you give me a pledge, until you send it?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,18);</script>He said, “What
pledge will I give you?”
<p>She said, “Your signet and your cord, and your staff that is in your
hand.”
<p>He gave them to her, and came in to her, and she conceived by him.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(38,19);</script>She arose, and went
away, and put off her veil from her, and put on the garments of her
widowhood. <script type="text/javascript">cb(38,20);</script>Judah sent
the young goat by the hand of his friend, the Adullamite, to receive the
pledge from the woman’s hand, but he didn’t find her. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(38,21);</script>Then he asked the men of her
place, saying, “Where is the prostitute, that was at Enaim by the
road?”
<p>They said, “There has been no prostitute here.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,22);</script>He returned to Judah,
and said, “I haven’t found her; and also the men of the place said,
‘There has been no prostitute here.’” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(38,23);</script>Judah said, “Let her keep it,
lest we be shamed. Behold, I sent this young goat, and you haven’t found
her.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,24);</script>It happened about
three months later, that it was told Judah, saying, “Tamar, your
daughter-in-law, has played the prostitute; and moreover, behold, she is
with child by prostitution.”
<p>Judah said, “Bring her out, and let her be burnt.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(38,25);</script>When she was brought out, she
sent to her father-in-law, saying, “By the man, whose these are, I am
with child.” She also said, “Please discern whose are these—the
signet, and the cords, and the staff.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,26);</script>Judah acknowledged
them, and said, “She is more righteous than I, because I didn’t give
her to Shelah, my son.”
<p>He knew her again no more. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(38,27);</script>It happened in the time of her
travail, that behold, twins were in her womb. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(38,28);</script>When she travailed, one put out
a hand, and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand,
saying, “This came out first.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(38,29);</script>It happened, as he drew back his
hand, that behold, his brother came out, and she said, “Why have you
made a breach for yourself?” Therefore his name was called <a
href="#N26">Perez.</a> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(38,30);</script>Afterward his brother came out,
that had the scarlet thread on his hand, and his name was called <a
href="#N27">Zerah.</a>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(39,1);</script>Joseph was brought
down to Egypt. Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s, the captain of the
guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites that had
brought him down there. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(39,2);</script>Yahweh was with Joseph, and he
was a prosperous man. He was in the house of his master the Egyptian.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(39,3);</script>His master saw that
Yahweh was with him, and that Yahweh made all that he did prosper in his
hand. <script type="text/javascript">cb(39,4);</script>Joseph found favor
in his sight. He ministered to him, and he made him overseer over his
house, and all that he had he put into his hand. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(39,5);</script>It happened from the time that he
made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that Yahweh
blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake; and the blessing of
Yahweh was on all that he had, in the house and in the field. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(39,6);</script>He left all that he had in
Joseph’s hand. He didn’t concern himself with anything, except for the
food which he ate.
<p>Joseph was well-built and handsome. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(39,7);</script>It happened after these things,
that his master’s wife cast her eyes on Joseph; and she said, “Lie
with me.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(39,8);</script>But he refused, and
said to his master’s wife, “Behold, my master doesn’t know what is
with me in the house, and he has put all that he has into my hand. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(39,9);</script>He isn’t greater in this house
than I, neither has he kept back anything from me but you, because you are
his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(39,10);</script>As she spoke to
Joseph day by day, he didn’t listen to her, to lie by her, or to be with
her. <script type="text/javascript">cb(39,11);</script>About this time, he
went into the house to do his work, and there were none of the men of the
house inside. <script type="text/javascript">cb(39,12);</script>She caught
him by his garment, saying, “Lie with me!”
<p>He left his garment in her hand, and ran outside. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(39,13);</script>When she saw that he had left
his garment in her hand, and had run outside, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(39,14);</script>she called to the men of her
house, and spoke to them, saying, “Behold, he has brought in a Hebrew to
us to mock us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud
voice. <script type="text/javascript">cb(39,15);</script>It happened, when
he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by
me, and ran outside.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(39,16);</script>She laid up his garment by her,
until his master came home. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(39,17);</script>She spoke to him according to
these words, saying, “The Hebrew servant, whom you have brought to us,
came in to me to mock me, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(39,18);</script>and it happened, as I lifted up
my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and ran outside.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(39,19);</script>It happened, when his
master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying,
“This is what your servant did to me,” that his wrath was kindled.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(39,20);</script>Joseph’s master took
him, and put him into the prison, the place where the king’s prisoners
were bound, and he was there in custody. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(39,21);</script>But Yahweh was with Joseph, and
showed kindness to him, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of
the prison. <script type="text/javascript">cb(39,22);</script>The keeper
of the prison committed to Joseph’s hand all the prisoners who were in
the prison. Whatever they did there, he was responsible for it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(39,23);</script>The keeper of the prison
didn’t look after anything that was under his hand, because Yahweh was
with him; and that which he did, Yahweh made it prosper.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(40,1);</script>It happened after
these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker offended
their lord, the king of Egypt. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(40,2);</script>Pharaoh was angry with his two
officers, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(40,3);</script>He put them in custody in the
house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph
was bound. <script type="text/javascript">cb(40,4);</script>The captain of
the guard assigned them to Joseph, and he took care of them. They stayed
in prison many days. <script type="text/javascript">cb(40,5);</script>They
both dreamed a dream, each man his dream, in one night, each man according
to the interpretation of his dream, the cupbearer and the baker of the
king of Egypt, who were bound in the prison. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(40,6);</script>Joseph came in to them in the
morning, and saw them, and saw that they were sad. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(40,7);</script>He asked Pharaoh’s officers who
were with him in custody in his master’s house, saying, “Why do you
look so sad today?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(40,8);</script>They said to him,
“We have dreamed a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it.”
<p>Joseph said to them, “Don’t interpretations belong to God? Please
tell it to me.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(40,9);</script>The chief cupbearer
told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, “In my dream, behold, a vine
was in front of me, <script type="text/javascript">cb(40,10);</script>and
in the vine were three branches. It was as though it budded, it blossomed,
and its clusters produced ripe grapes. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(40,11);</script>Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand;
and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and I gave
the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(40,12);</script>Joseph said to him,
“This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(40,13);</script>Within three more days, Pharaoh
will lift up your head, and restore you to your office. You will give
Pharaoh’s cup into his hand, the way you did when you were his
cupbearer. <script type="text/javascript">cb(40,14);</script>But remember
me when it will be well with you, and please show kindness to me, and make
mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(40,15);</script>For indeed, I was stolen away
out of the land of the Hebrews, and here also have I done nothing that
they should put me into the dungeon.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(40,16);</script>When the chief baker
saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, “I also was in
my dream, and behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(40,17);</script>In the uppermost basket
there was all kinds of baked food for Pharaoh, and the birds ate them out
of the basket on my head.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(40,18);</script>Joseph answered,
“This is its interpretation. The three baskets are three days. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(40,19);</script>Within three more days, Pharaoh
will lift up your head from off you, and will hang you on a tree; and the
birds will eat your flesh from off you.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(40,20);</script>It happened the third day, which
was Pharaoh’s birthday, that he made a feast for all his servants, and
he lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief
baker among his servants. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(40,21);</script>He restored the chief cupbearer
to his position again, and he gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(40,22);</script>but he hanged the chief baker,
as Joseph had interpreted to them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(40,23);</script>Yet the chief cupbearer didn’t
remember Joseph, but forgot him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(41,1);</script>It happened at the end
of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and behold, he stood by the
river. <script type="text/javascript">cb(41,2);</script>Behold, there came
up out of the river seven cattle, sleek and fat, and they fed in the marsh
grass. <script type="text/javascript">cb(41,3);</script>Behold, seven
other cattle came up after them out of the river, ugly and thin, and stood
by the other cattle on the brink of the river. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(41,4);</script>The ugly and thin cattle ate up
the seven sleek and fat cattle. So Pharaoh awoke. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(41,5);</script>He slept and dreamed a second
time: and behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, healthy and
good. <script type="text/javascript">cb(41,6);</script>Behold, seven heads
of grain, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(41,7);</script>The thin heads of grain
swallowed up the seven healthy and full ears. Pharaoh awoke, and behold,
it was a dream. <script type="text/javascript">cb(41,8);</script>It
happened in the morning that his spirit was troubled, and he sent and
called for all of Egypt’s magicians and wise men. Pharaoh told them his
dreams, but there was no one who could interpret them to Pharaoh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(41,9);</script>Then the chief
cupbearer spoke to Pharaoh, saying, “I remember my faults today. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(41,10);</script>Pharaoh was angry with his
servants, and put me in custody in the house of the captain of the guard,
me and the chief baker. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(41,11);</script>We dreamed a dream in one night,
I and he. We dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his
dream. <script type="text/javascript">cb(41,12);</script>There was with us
there a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard, and we
told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams. To each man according to
his dream he interpreted. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(41,13);</script>It happened, as he interpreted
to us, so it was: he restored me to my office, and he hanged him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(41,14);</script>Then Pharaoh sent and
called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon. He shaved
himself, changed his clothing, and came in to Pharaoh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(41,15);</script>Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I
have dreamed a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. I have
heard it said of you, that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(41,16);</script>Joseph answered
Pharaoh, saying, “It isn’t in me. God will give Pharaoh an answer of
peace.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(41,17);</script>Pharaoh spoke to
Joseph, “In my dream, behold, I stood on the brink of the river: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(41,18);</script>and behold, there came up out of
the river seven cattle, fat and sleek. They fed in the marsh grass,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(41,19);</script>and behold, seven other
cattle came up after them, poor and very ugly and thin, such as I never
saw in all the land of Egypt for ugliness. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(41,20);</script>The thin and ugly cattle ate up
the first seven fat cattle, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(41,21);</script>and when they had eaten them up,
it couldn’t be known that they had eaten them, but they were still ugly,
as at the beginning. So I awoke. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(41,22);</script>I saw in my dream, and behold,
seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, full and good: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(41,23);</script>and behold, seven heads of
grain, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after
them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(41,24);</script>The thin heads of
grain swallowed up the seven good heads of grain. I told it to the
magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(41,25);</script>Joseph said to
Pharaoh, “The dream of Pharaoh is one. What God is about to do he has
declared to Pharaoh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(41,26);</script>The
seven good cattle are seven years; and the seven good heads of grain are
seven years. The dream is one. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(41,27);</script>The seven thin and ugly cattle
that came up after them are seven years, and also the seven empty heads of
grain blasted with the east wind; they will be seven years of famine.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(41,28);</script>That is the thing which
I spoke to Pharaoh. What God is about to do he has shown to Pharaoh.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(41,29);</script>Behold, there come seven
years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(41,30);</script>There will arise after them
seven years of famine, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of
Egypt. The famine will consume the land, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(41,31);</script>and the plenty will not be known
in the land by reason of that famine which follows; for it will be very
grievous. <script type="text/javascript">cb(41,32);</script>The dream was
doubled to Pharaoh, because the thing is established by God, and God will
shortly bring it to pass.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(41,33);</script>“Now therefore let
Pharaoh look for a discreet and wise man, and set him over the land of
Egypt. <script type="text/javascript">cb(41,34);</script>Let Pharaoh do
this, and let him appoint overseers over the land, and take up the fifth
part of the land of Egypt’s produce in the seven plenteous years.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(41,35);</script>Let them gather all the
food of these good years that come, and lay up grain under the hand of
Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(41,36);</script>The food will be for a store to
the land against the seven years of famine, which will be in the land of
Egypt; that the land not perish through the famine.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(41,37);</script>The thing was good in
the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(41,38);</script>Pharaoh said to his servants,
“Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom is the Spirit of God?”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(41,39);</script>Pharaoh said to Joseph,
“Because God has shown you all of this, there is none so discreet and
wise as you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(41,40);</script>You shall
be over my house, and according to your word will all my people be ruled.
Only in the throne I will be greater than you.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(41,41);</script>Pharaoh said to Joseph,
“Behold, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(41,42);</script>Pharaoh took off his signet ring
from his hand, and put it on Joseph’s hand, and arrayed him in robes of
fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(41,43);</script>and he made him to ride in the
second chariot which he had. They cried before him, “Bow the knee!” He
set him over all the land of Egypt. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(41,44);</script>Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I am
Pharaoh, and without you shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all
the land of Egypt.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(41,45);</script>Pharaoh called Joseph’s name
Zaphenath-Paneah; and he gave him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera
priest of On as a wife. Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(41,46);</script>Joseph was thirty
years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. Joseph went out from
the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(41,47);</script>In the seven plenteous
years the earth produced abundantly. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(41,48);</script>He gathered up all the food of
the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in
the cities: the food of the field, which was around every city, he laid up
in the same. <script type="text/javascript">cb(41,49);</script>Joseph laid
up grain as the sand of the sea, very much, until he stopped counting, for
it was without number. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(41,50);</script>To Joseph were born two sons
before the year of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera
priest of On, bore to him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(41,51);</script>Joseph called the name of the
firstborn <a href="#N28">Manasseh,</a> “For,” he said, “God has made
me forget all my toil, and all my father’s house.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(41,52);</script>The name of the second, he
called <a href="#N29">Ephraim</a>: “For God has made me fruitful in the
land of my affliction.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(41,53);</script>The seven years of
plenty, that were in the land of Egypt, came to an end. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(41,54);</script>The seven years of famine began
to come, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in all lands, but in
all the land of Egypt there was bread. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(41,55);</script>When all the land of Egypt was
famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread, and Pharaoh said to all
the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph. What he says to you, do.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(41,56);</script>The famine was over all the
surface of the earth. Joseph opened all the store houses, and sold to the
Egyptians. The famine was severe in the land of Egypt. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(41,57);</script>All countries came into Egypt,
to Joseph, to buy grain, because the famine was severe in all the earth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,1);</script>Now Jacob saw that
there was grain in Egypt, and Jacob said to his sons, “Why do you look
at one another?” <script type="text/javascript">cb(42,2);</script>He
said, “Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there,
and buy for us from there, so that we may live, and not die.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(42,3);</script>Joseph’s ten brothers went down
to buy grain from Egypt. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(42,4);</script>But Jacob didn’t send Benjamin,
Joseph’s brother, with his brothers; for he said, “Lest perhaps harm
happen to him.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(42,5);</script>The
sons of Israel came to buy among those who came, for the famine was in the
land of Canaan. <script type="text/javascript">cb(42,6);</script>Joseph
was the governor over the land. It was he who sold to all the people of
the land. Joseph’s brothers came, and bowed themselves down to him with
their faces to the earth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(42,7);</script>Joseph saw his brothers, and he
recognized them, but acted like a stranger to them, and spoke roughly with
them. He said to them, “Where did you come from?”
<p>They said, “From the land of Canaan to buy food.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,8);</script>Joseph recognized his
brothers, but they didn’t recognize him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(42,9);</script>Joseph remembered the dreams
which he dreamed about them, and said to them, “You are spies! You have
come to see the nakedness of the land.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,10);</script>They said to him,
“No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(42,11);</script>We are all one man’s sons; we
are honest men. Your servants are not spies.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,12);</script>He said to them,
“No, but you have come to see the nakedness of the land!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,13);</script>They said, “We,
your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of
Canaan; and behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is
no more.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,14);</script>Joseph said to them,
“It is like I told you, saying, ‘You are spies!’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(42,15);</script>By this you shall be tested. By
the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go out from here, unless your youngest
brother comes here. <script type="text/javascript">cb(42,16);</script>Send
one of you, and let him get your brother, and you shall be bound, that
your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you, or else by the
life of Pharaoh surely you are spies.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(42,17);</script>He put them all together into
custody for three days.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,18);</script>Joseph said to them
the third day, “Do this, and live, for I fear God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(42,19);</script>If you are honest men, then let
one of your brothers be bound in your prison; but you go, carry grain for
the famine of your houses. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(42,20);</script>Bring your youngest brother to
me; so will your words be verified, and you won’t die.”
<p>They did so. <script type="text/javascript">cb(42,21);</script>They
said one to another, “We are certainly guilty concerning our brother, in
that we saw the distress of his soul, when he begged us, and we wouldn’t
listen. Therefore this distress has come upon us.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(42,22);</script>Reuben answered them, saying,
“Didn’t I tell you, saying, ‘Don’t sin against the child,’ and
you wouldn’t listen? Therefore also, behold, his blood is required.”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(42,23);</script>They didn’t know that
Joseph understood them; for there was an interpreter between them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(42,24);</script>He turned himself away from
them, and wept. Then he returned to them, and spoke to them, and took
Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(42,25);</script>Then Joseph gave a command to
fill their bags with grain, and to restore each man’s money into his
sack, and to give them food for the way. So it was done to them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,26);</script>They loaded their
donkeys with their grain, and departed from there. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(42,27);</script>As one of them opened his sack
to give his donkey food in the lodging place, he saw his money. Behold, it
was in the mouth of his sack. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(42,28);</script>He said to his brothers, “My
money is restored! Behold, it is in my sack!” Their hearts failed them,
and they turned trembling one to another, saying, “What is this that God
has done to us?” <script type="text/javascript">cb(42,29);</script>They
came to Jacob their father, to the land of Canaan, and told him all that
had happened to them, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(42,30);</script>“The man, the lord of the
land, spoke roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(42,31);</script>We said to him, ‘We are honest
men. We are no spies. <script type="text/javascript">cb(42,32);</script>We
are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is no more, and the youngest
is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(42,33);</script>The man, the lord of the land,
said to us, ‘By this I will know that you are honest men: leave one of
your brothers with me, and take grain for the famine of your houses, and
go your way. <script type="text/javascript">cb(42,34);</script>Bring your
youngest brother to me. Then I will know that you are not spies, but that
you are honest men. So I will deliver your brother to you, and you shall
trade in the land.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,35);</script>It happened as they
emptied their sacks, that behold, each man’s bundle of money was in his
sack. When they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were
afraid. <script type="text/javascript">cb(42,36);</script>Jacob, their
father, said to them, “You have bereaved me of my children! Joseph is no
more, Simeon is no more, and you want to take Benjamin away. All these
things are against me.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,37);</script>Reuben spoke to his
father, saying, “Kill my two sons, if I don’t bring him to you.
Entrust him to my care, and I will bring him to you again.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,38);</script>He said, “My son
shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he only is left.
If harm happens to him along the way in which you go, then you will bring
down my gray hairs with sorrow to <a href="#N30">Sheol</a>.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,1);</script>The famine was severe
in the land. <script type="text/javascript">cb(43,2);</script>It happened,
when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of Egypt,
their father said to them, “Go again, buy us a little more food.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,3);</script>Judah spoke to him,
saying, “The man solemnly warned us, saying, ‘You shall not see my
face, unless your brother is with you.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(43,4);</script>If you’ll send our brother with
us, we’ll go down and buy you food, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(43,5);</script>but if you’ll not send him,
we’ll not go down, for the man said to us, ‘You shall not see my face,
unless your brother is with you.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,6);</script>Israel said, “Why
did you treat me so badly, telling the man that you had another brother?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,7);</script>They said, “The man
asked directly concerning ourselves, and concerning our relatives, saying,
‘Is your father still alive? Have you another brother?’ We just
answered his questions. Is there any way we could know that he would say,
‘Bring your brother down?’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,8);</script>Judah said to Israel,
his father, “Send the boy with me, and we’ll get up and go, so that we
may live, and not die, both we, and you, and also our little ones. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(43,9);</script>I’ll be collateral for him.
From my hand will you require him. If I don’t bring him to you, and set
him before you, then let me bear the blame forever, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(43,10);</script>for if we hadn’t delayed,
surely we would have returned a second time by now.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,11);</script>Their father, Israel,
said to them, “If it must be so, then do this. Take from the choice
fruits of the land in your bags, and carry down a present for the man, a
little balm, a little honey, spices and myrrh, nuts, and almonds; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(43,12);</script>and take double money in your
hand, and take back the money that was returned in the mouth of your
sacks. Perhaps it was an oversight. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(43,13);</script>Take your brother also, get up,
and return to the man. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(43,14);</script>May God Almighty give you mercy
before the man, that he may release to you your other brother and
Benjamin. If I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,15);</script>The men took that
present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and got
up, went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(43,16);</script>When Joseph saw Benjamin with
them, he said to the steward of his house, “Bring the men into the
house, and butcher an animal, and prepare; for the men will dine with me
at noon.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,17);</script>The man did as Joseph
commanded, and the man brought the men to Joseph’s house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(43,18);</script>The men were afraid, because
they were brought to Joseph’s house; and they said, “Because of the
money that was returned in our sacks at the first time, we’re brought
in; that he may seek occasion against us, attack us, and seize us as
slaves, along with our donkeys.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(43,19);</script>They came near to the steward of
Joseph’s house, and they spoke to him at the door of the house, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(43,20);</script>and said, “Oh, my lord, we
indeed came down the first time to buy food. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(43,21);</script>When we came to the lodging
place, we opened our sacks, and behold, each man’s money was in the
mouth of his sack, our money in full weight. We have brought it back in
our hand. <script type="text/javascript">cb(43,22);</script>We have
brought down other money in our hand to buy food. We don’t know who put
our money in our sacks.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,23);</script>He said, “Peace be
to you. Don’t be afraid. Your God, and the God of your father, has given
you treasure in your sacks. I received your money.” He brought Simeon
out to them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(43,24);</script>The man
brought the men into Joseph’s house, and gave them water, and they
washed their feet. He gave their donkeys fodder. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(43,25);</script>They prepared the present for
Joseph’s coming at noon, for they heard that they should eat bread there.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,26);</script>When Joseph came
home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house,
and bowed themselves down to him to the earth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(43,27);</script>He asked them of their welfare,
and said, “Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he yet
alive?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,28);</script>They said, “Your
servant, our father, is well. He is still alive.” They bowed down
humbly. <script type="text/javascript">cb(43,29);</script>He lifted up his
eyes, and saw Benjamin, his brother, his mother’s son, and said, “Is
this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me?” He said, “God be
gracious to you, my son.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(43,30);</script>Joseph hurried, for his heart
yearned over his brother; and he sought a place to weep. He entered into
his room, and wept there. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(43,31);</script>He washed his face, and came
out. He controlled himself, and said, “Serve the meal.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(43,32);</script>They served him by
himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians, that ate with him, by
themselves, because the Egyptians don’t eat bread with the Hebrews, for
that is an abomination to the Egyptians. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(43,33);</script>They sat before him, the
firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his
youth, and the men marveled one with another. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(43,34);</script>He sent portions to them from
before him, but Benjamin’s portion was five times as much as any of
theirs. They drank, and were merry with him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(44,1);</script>He commanded the
steward of his house, saying, “Fill the men’s sacks with food, as much
as they can carry, and put each man’s money in his sack’s mouth.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(44,2);</script>Put my cup, the silver
cup, in the sack’s mouth of the youngest, with his grain money.” He
did according to the word that Joseph had spoken. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(44,3);</script>As soon as the morning was light,
the men were sent away, they and their donkeys. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(44,4);</script>When they had gone out of the
city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said to his steward, “Up, follow
after the men. When you overtake them, ask them, ‘Why have you rewarded
evil for good? <script type="text/javascript">cb(44,5);</script>Isn’t
this that from which my lord drinks, and by which he indeed divines? You
have done evil in so doing.’” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(44,6);</script>He overtook them, and he spoke
these words to them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(44,7);</script>They said to him,
“Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your
servants that they should do such a thing! <script
type="text/javascript">cb(44,8);</script>Behold, the money, which we found
in our sacks’ mouths, we brought again to you out of the land of Canaan.
How then should we steal silver or gold out of your lord’s house?
<script type="text/javascript">cb(44,9);</script>With whomever of your
servants it is found, let him die, and we also will be my lord’s
bondservants.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(44,10);</script>He said, “Now also
let it be according to your words: he with whom it is found will be my
bondservant; and you will be blameless.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(44,11);</script>Then they hurried,
and each man took his sack down to the ground, and each man opened his
sack. <script type="text/javascript">cb(44,12);</script>He searched,
beginning with the eldest, and ending at the youngest. The cup was found
in Benjamin’s sack. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(44,13);</script>Then they tore their clothes,
and each man loaded his donkey, and returned to the city.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(44,14);</script>Judah and his
brothers came to Joseph’s house, and he was still there. They fell on
the ground before him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(44,15);</script>Joseph said to them, “What
deed is this that you have done? Don’t you know that such a man as I can
indeed divine?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(44,16);</script>Judah said, “What
will we tell my lord? What will we speak? Or how will we clear ourselves?
God has found out the iniquity of your servants. Behold, we are my
lord’s bondservants, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is
found.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(44,17);</script>He said, “Far be it
from me that I should do so. The man in whose hand the cup is found, he
will be my bondservant; but as for you, go up in peace to your father.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(44,18);</script>Then Judah came near
to him, and said, “Oh, my lord, please let your servant speak a word in
my lord’s ears, and don’t let your anger burn against your servant;
for you are even as Pharaoh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(44,19);</script>My lord asked his servants,
saying, ‘Have you a father, or a brother?’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(44,20);</script>We said to my lord, ‘We have a
father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his
brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother; and his father loves
him.’ <script type="text/javascript">cb(44,21);</script>You said to your
servants, ‘Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes on him.’
<script type="text/javascript">cb(44,22);</script>We said to my lord,
‘The boy can’t leave his father: for if he should leave his father,
his father would die.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(44,23);</script>You said to your servants,
‘Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will see my face
no more.’ <script type="text/javascript">cb(44,24);</script>It happened
when we came up to your servant my father, we told him the words of my
lord. <script type="text/javascript">cb(44,25);</script>Our father said,
‘Go again, buy us a little food.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(44,26);</script>We said, ‘We can’t go down.
If our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down: for we may not
see the man’s face, unless our youngest brother is with us.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(44,27);</script>Your servant, my father, said to
us, ‘You know that my wife bore me two sons: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(44,28);</script>and the one went out from me,
and I said, “Surely he is torn in pieces”; and I haven’t seen him
since. <script type="text/javascript">cb(44,29);</script>If you take this
one also from me, and harm happens to him, you will bring down my gray
hairs with sorrow to <a href="#N31">Sheol</a>.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(44,30);</script>Now therefore when I come to
your servant my father, and the boy is not with us; since his life is
bound up in the boy’s life; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(44,31);</script>it will happen, when he sees
that the boy is no more, that he will die. Your servants will bring down
the gray hairs of your servant, our father, with sorrow to <a
href="#N32">Sheol</a>. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(44,32);</script>For your servant became
collateral for the boy to my father, saying, ‘If I don’t bring him to
you, then I will bear the blame to my father forever.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(44,33);</script>Now therefore, please let your
servant stay instead of the boy, a bondservant to my lord; and let the boy
go up with his brothers. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(44,34);</script>For how will I go up to my
father, if the boy isn’t with me?—lest I see the evil that will come
on my father.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(45,1);</script>Then Joseph couldn’t
control himself before all those who stood before him, and he cried,
“Cause everyone to go out from me!” No one else stood with him, while
Joseph made himself known to his brothers. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(45,2);</script>He wept aloud. The Egyptians
heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(45,3);</script>Joseph said to his brothers, “I
am Joseph! Does my father still live?”
<p>His brothers couldn’t answer him; for they were terrified at his
presence. <script type="text/javascript">cb(45,4);</script>Joseph said to
his brothers, “Come near to me, please.”
<p>They came near. “He said, I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold
into Egypt. <script type="text/javascript">cb(45,5);</script>Now don’t
be grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that you sold me here, for God sent
me before you to preserve life. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(45,6);</script>For these two years the famine
has been in the land, and there are yet five years, in which there will be
neither plowing nor harvest. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(45,7);</script>God sent me before you to
preserve for you a remnant in the earth, and to save you alive by a great
deliverance. <script type="text/javascript">cb(45,8);</script>So now it
wasn’t you who sent me here, but God, and he has made me a father to
Pharaoh, lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(45,9);</script>Hurry, and go up to my
father, and tell him, ‘This is what your son Joseph says, “God has
made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me. Don’t wait. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(45,10);</script>You shall dwell in the land of
Goshen, and you will be near to me, you, your children, your children’s
children, your flocks, your herds, and all that you have. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(45,11);</script>There I will nourish you; for
there are yet five years of famine; lest you come to poverty, you, and
your household, and all that you have.”’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(45,12);</script>Behold, your eyes see, and the
eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaks to you.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(45,13);</script>You shall tell my father
of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that you have seen. You shall hurry
and bring my father down here.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(45,14);</script>He fell on his brother
Benjamin’s neck, and wept, and Benjamin wept on his neck. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(45,15);</script>He kissed all his brothers, and
wept on them. After that his brothers talked with him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(45,16);</script>The report of it was
heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying, “Joseph’s brothers have come.”
It pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(45,17);</script>Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Tell
your brothers, ‘Do this. Load your animals, and go, travel to the land
of Canaan. <script type="text/javascript">cb(45,18);</script>Take your
father and your households, and come to me, and I will give you the good
of the land of Egypt, and you will eat the fat of the land.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(45,19);</script>Now you are commanded: do this.
Take wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your
wives, and bring your father, and come. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(45,20);</script>Also, don’t concern yourselves
about your belongings, for the good of all of the land of Egypt is
yours.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(45,21);</script>The sons of Israel
did so. Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh,
and gave them provision for the way. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(45,22);</script>He gave each one of them changes
of clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and
five changes of clothing. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(45,23);</script>He sent the following to his
father: ten donkeys loaded with the good things of Egypt, and ten female
donkeys loaded with grain and bread and provision for his father by the
way. <script type="text/javascript">cb(45,24);</script>So he sent his
brothers away, and they departed. He said to them, “See that you don’t
quarrel on the way.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(45,25);</script>They went up out of
Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan, to Jacob their father. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(45,26);</script>They told him, saying, “Joseph
is still alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt.” His heart
fainted, for he didn’t believe them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(45,27);</script>They told him all the words of
Joseph, which he had said to them. When he saw the wagons which Joseph had
sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob, their father, revived. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(45,28);</script>Israel said, “It is enough.
Joseph my son is still alive. I will go and see him before I die.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(46,1);</script>Israel traveled with
all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices to the God
of his father, Isaac. <script type="text/javascript">cb(46,2);</script>God
spoke to Israel in the visions of the night, and said, “Jacob, Jacob!”
<p>He said, “Here I am.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(46,3);</script>He said, “I am God,
the God of your father. Don’t be afraid to go down into Egypt, for there
I will make of you a great nation. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(46,4);</script>I will go down with you into
Egypt. I will also surely bring you up again. Joseph will close your
eyes.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(46,5);</script>Jacob rose up from
Beersheba, and the sons of Israel carried Jacob, their father, their
little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to
carry him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(46,6);</script>They took
their livestock, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of
Canaan, and came into Egypt—Jacob, and all his seed with him, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(46,7);</script>his sons, and his sons’ sons
with him, his daughters, and his sons’ daughters, and he brought all his
seed with him into Egypt.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(46,8);</script>These are the names of
the children of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben,
Jacob’s firstborn. <script type="text/javascript">cb(46,9);</script>The
sons of Reuben: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(46,10);</script>The sons of Simeon: Jemuel,
Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(46,11);</script>The sons of Levi:
Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(46,12);</script>The sons of Judah: Er, Onan,
Shelah, Perez, and Zerah; but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. The
sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(46,13);</script>The sons of Issachar: Tola,
Puvah, Iob, and Shimron. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(46,14);</script>The sons of Zebulun: Sered,
Elon, and Jahleel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(46,15);</script>These
are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan Aram, with his
daughter Dinah. All the souls of his sons and his daughters were
thirty-three. <script type="text/javascript">cb(46,16);</script>The sons
of Gad: Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(46,17);</script>The sons of Asher: Imnah,
Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, and Serah their sister. The sons of Beriah: Heber
and Malchiel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(46,18);</script>These are
the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah, his daughter, and these she
bore to Jacob, even sixteen souls. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(46,19);</script>The sons of Rachel, Jacob’s
wife: Joseph and Benjamin. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(46,20);</script>To Joseph in the land of Egypt
were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera,
priest of On, bore to him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(46,21);</script>The sons of Benjamin: Bela,
Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(46,22);</script>These are the sons of Rachel,
who were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(46,23);</script>The son of Dan: Hushim. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(46,24);</script>The sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel,
Guni, Jezer, and Shillem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(46,25);</script>These are the sons of Bilhah,
whom Laban gave to Rachel, his daughter, and these she bore to Jacob: all
the souls were seven. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(46,26);</script>All the souls who came with
Jacob into Egypt, who were his direct descendants, besides Jacob’s
sons’ wives, all the souls were sixty-six. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(46,27);</script>The sons of Joseph, who were
born to him in Egypt, were two souls. All the souls of the house of Jacob,
who came into Egypt, were seventy.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(46,28);</script>He sent Judah before
him to Joseph, to show the way before him to Goshen, and they came into
the land of Goshen. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(46,29);</script>Joseph prepared his chariot, and
went up to meet Israel, his father, in Goshen. He presented himself to
him, and fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(46,30);</script>Israel said to Joseph, “Now
let me die, since I have seen your face, that you are still alive.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(46,31);</script>Joseph said to his
brothers, and to his father’s house, “I will go up, and speak with
Pharaoh, and will tell him, ‘My brothers, and my father’s house, who
were in the land of Canaan, have come to me. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(46,32);</script>These men are shepherds, for
they have been keepers of livestock, and they have brought their flocks,
and their herds, and all that they have.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(46,33);</script>It will happen, when Pharaoh
summons you, and will say, ‘What is your occupation?’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(46,34);</script>that you shall say, ‘Your
servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth even until now,
both we, and our fathers:’ that you may dwell in the land of Goshen; for
every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(47,1);</script>Then Joseph went in
and told Pharaoh, and said, “My father and my brothers, with their
flocks, their herds, and all that they own, have come out of the land of
Canaan; and behold, they are in the land of Goshen.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(47,2);</script>From among his brothers he took
five men, and presented them to Pharaoh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(47,3);</script>Pharaoh said to his brothers,
“What is your occupation?”
<p>They said to Pharaoh, “Your servants are shepherds, both we, and our
fathers.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(47,4);</script>They said to
Pharaoh, “We have come to live as foreigners in the land, for there is
no pasture for your servants’ flocks. For the famine is severe in the
land of Canaan. Now therefore, please let your servants dwell in the land
of Goshen.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(47,5);</script>Pharaoh spoke to
Joseph, saying, “Your father and your brothers have come to you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(47,6);</script>The land of Egypt is before you.
Make your father and your brothers dwell in the best of the land. Let them
dwell in the land of Goshen. If you know any able men among them, then put
them in charge of my livestock.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(47,7);</script>Joseph brought in
Jacob, his father, and set him before Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(47,8);</script>Pharaoh said to Jacob,
“How many are the days of the years of your life?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(47,9);</script>Jacob said to Pharaoh,
“The days of the years of my pilgrimage are one hundred thirty years.
Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not
attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of
their pilgrimage.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(47,10);</script>Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went
out from the presence of Pharaoh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(47,11);</script>Joseph placed his
father and his brothers, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt,
in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(47,12);</script>Joseph nourished his
father, his brothers, and all of his father’s household, with bread,
according to their families.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(47,13);</script>There was no bread in
all the land; for the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt
and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(47,14);</script>Joseph gathered up all the money
that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the
grain which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s
house. <script type="text/javascript">cb(47,15);</script>When the money
was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the
Egyptians came to Joseph, and said, “Give us bread, for why should we
die in your presence? For our money fails.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(47,16);</script>Joseph said, “Give
me your livestock; and I will give you food for your livestock, if your
money is gone.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(47,17);</script>They brought their
livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the
horses, and for the flocks, and for the herds, and for the donkeys: and he
fed them with bread in exchange for all their livestock for that year.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(47,18);</script>When that year was
ended, they came to him the second year, and said to him, “We will not
hide from my lord how our money is all spent, and the herds of livestock
are my lord’s. There is nothing left in the sight of my lord, but our
bodies, and our lands. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(47,19);</script>Why should we die before your
eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our
land will be servants to Pharaoh. Give us seed, that we may live, and not
die, and that the land won’t be desolate.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(47,20);</script>So Joseph bought all
the land of Egypt for Pharaoh, for every man of the Egyptians sold his
field, because the famine was severe on them, and the land became
Pharaoh’s. <script type="text/javascript">cb(47,21);</script>As for the
people, he moved them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt
even to the other end of it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(47,22);</script>Only he didn’t buy the land of
the priests, for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh, and ate their
portion which Pharaoh gave them. That is why they didn’t sell their
land. <script type="text/javascript">cb(47,23);</script>Then Joseph said
to the people, “Behold, I have bought you and your land today for
Pharaoh. Behold, here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(47,24);</script>It will happen at the harvests,
that you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four parts will be your own,
for seed of the field, for your food, for them of your households, and for
food for your little ones.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(47,25);</script>They said, “You
have saved our lives! Let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we
will be Pharaoh’s servants.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(47,26);</script>Joseph made it a
statute concerning the land of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh should have
the fifth. Only the land of the priests alone didn’t become Pharaoh’s.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(47,27);</script>Israel lived in the
land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they got themselves possessions
therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(47,28);</script>Jacob lived in the land of Egypt
seventeen years. So the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were one
hundred forty-seven years. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(47,29);</script>The time drew near that Israel
must die, and he called his son Joseph, and said to him, “If now I have
found favor in your sight, please put your hand under my thigh, and deal
kindly and truly with me. Please don’t bury me in Egypt, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(47,30);</script>but when I sleep with my
fathers, you shall carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying
place.”
<p>He said, “I will do as you have said.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(47,31);</script>He said, “Swear to
me,” and he swore to him. Israel bowed himself on the bed’s head.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(48,1);</script>It happened after
these things, that someone said to Joseph, “Behold, your father is
sick.” He took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(48,2);</script>Someone told Jacob, and said,
“Behold, your son Joseph comes to you,” and Israel strengthened
himself, and sat on the bed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(48,3);</script>Jacob said to Joseph, “God
Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(48,4);</script>and said to me,
‘Behold, I will make you fruitful, and multiply you, and I will make of
you a company of peoples, and will give this land to your seed after you
for an everlasting possession.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(48,5);</script>Now your two sons, who were born
to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt, are mine;
Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, will be mine. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(48,6);</script>Your issue, whom you become the
father of after them, will be yours. They will be called after the name of
their brothers in their inheritance. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(48,7);</script>As for me, when I came from
Paddan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when there was
still some distance to come to Ephrath, and I buried her there in the way
to Ephrath (the same is Bethlehem).”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(48,8);</script>Israel saw Joseph’s
sons, and said, “Who are these?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(48,9);</script>Joseph said to his
father, “They are my sons, whom God has given me here.”
<p>He said, “Please bring them to me, and I will bless them.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(48,10);</script>Now the eyes of Israel were dim
for age, so that he couldn’t see. He brought them near to him; and he
kissed them, and embraced them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(48,11);</script>Israel said to Joseph, “I
didn’t think I would see your face, and behold, God has let me see your
seed also.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(48,12);</script>Joseph
brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his
face to the earth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(48,13);</script>Joseph took them both, Ephraim
in his right hand toward Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in his left
hand toward Israel’s right hand, and brought them near to him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(48,14);</script>Israel stretched out his right
hand, and laid it on Ephraim’s head, who was the younger, and his left
hand on Manasseh’s head, guiding his hands knowingly, for Manasseh was
the firstborn. <script type="text/javascript">cb(48,15);</script>He
blessed Joseph, and said, “The God before whom my fathers Abraham and
Isaac walked, the God who has fed me all my life long to this day, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(48,16);</script>the angel who has redeemed me
from all evil, bless the lads, and let my name be named on them, and the
name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac. Let them grow into a multitude in
the midst of the earth.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(48,17);</script>When Joseph saw that
his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased him.
He held up his father’s hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s head to
Manasseh’s head. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(48,18);</script>Joseph said to his father,
“Not so, my father; for this is the firstborn; put your right hand on
his head.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(48,19);</script>His father refused,
and said, “I know, my son, I know. He also will become a people, and he
also will be great. However, his younger brother will be greater than he,
and his seed will become a multitude of nations.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(48,20);</script>He blessed them that day,
saying, “In you will Israel bless, saying, ‘God make you as Ephraim
and as Manasseh’” He set Ephraim before Manasseh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(48,21);</script>Israel said to Joseph,
“Behold, I am dying, but God will be with you, and bring you again to
the land of your fathers. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(48,22);</script>Moreover I have given to you one
portion above your brothers, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite
with my sword and with my bow.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(49,1);</script>Jacob called to his
sons, and said: “Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that
which will happen to you in the days to come.
<dl>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(49,2);</script>Assemble yourselves,

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(49,28);</script>All these are the
twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father spoke to them and
blessed them. He blessed everyone according to his blessing. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(49,29);</script>He instructed them, and said to
them, “I am to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the
cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(49,30);</script>in the cave that is in the field
of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham
bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite as a burial place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(49,31);</script>There they buried Abraham and
Sarah, his wife. There they buried Isaac and Rebekah, his wife, and there
I buried Leah: <script type="text/javascript">cb(49,32);</script>the field
and the cave that is therein, which was purchased from the children of
Heth.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(49,33);</script>When Jacob made
an end of charging his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and
yielded up the spirit, and was gathered to his people.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(50,1);</script>Joseph fell on his
father’s face, wept on him, and kissed him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(50,2);</script>Joseph commanded his servants,
the physicians, to embalm his father; and the physicians embalmed Israel.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(50,3);</script>Forty days were fulfilled
for him, for that is how many the days it takes to embalm. The Egyptians
wept for him for seventy days.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(50,4);</script>When the days of
weeping for him were past, Joseph spoke to the house of Pharaoh, saying,
“If now I have found favor in your eyes, please speak in the ears of
Pharaoh, saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(50,5);</script>‘My
father made me swear, saying, “Behold, I am dying. Bury me in my grave
which I have dug for myself in the land of Canaan.” Now therefore,
please let me go up and bury my father, and I will come again.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(50,6);</script>Pharaoh said, “Go
up, and bury your father, just like he made you swear.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(50,7);</script>Joseph went up to bury
his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders
of his house, all the elders of the land of Egypt, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(50,8);</script>all the house of Joseph, his
brothers, and his father’s house. Only their little ones, their flocks,
and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(50,9);</script>There went up with him both
chariots and horsemen. It was a very great company. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(50,10);</script>They came to the threshing floor
of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, and there they lamented with a very
great and severe lamentation. He mourned for his father seven days.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(50,11);</script>When the inhabitants of
the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they
said, “This is a grievous mourning by the Egyptians.” Therefore its
name was called Abel Mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(50,12);</script>His sons did to him just as he
commanded them, <script type="text/javascript">cb(50,13);</script>for his
sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of
the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field, for a
possession of a burial site, from Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(50,14);</script>Joseph returned into
Egypt—he, and his brothers, and all that went up with him to bury his
father, after he had buried his father.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(50,15);</script>When Joseph’s
brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “It may be that
Joseph will hate us, and will fully pay us back for all of the evil which
we did to him.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(50,16);</script>They
sent a message to Joseph, saying, “Your father commanded before he died,
saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(50,17);</script>‘You shall
tell Joseph, “Now please forgive the disobedience of your brothers, and
their sin, because they did evil to you.”’ Now, please forgive the
disobedience of the servants of the God of your father.” Joseph wept
when they spoke to him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(50,18);</script>His brothers also went and fell
down before his face; and they said, “Behold, we are your servants.”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(50,19);</script>Joseph said to them,
“Don’t be afraid, for am I in the place of God? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(50,20);</script>As for you, you meant evil
against me, but God meant it for good, to bring to pass, as it is this
day, to save many people alive. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(50,21);</script>Now therefore don’t be afraid.
I will nourish you and your little ones.” He comforted them, and spoke
kindly to them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(50,22);</script>Joseph lived in
Egypt, he, and his father’s house. Joseph lived one hundred ten years.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(50,23);</script>Joseph saw Ephraim’s
children to the third generation. The children also of Machir, the son of
Manasseh, were born on Joseph’s knees. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(50,24);</script>Joseph said to his brothers,
“I am dying, but God will surely visit you, and bring you up out of this
land to the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(50,25);</script>Joseph took an oath of
the children of Israel, saying, “God will surely visit you, and you
shall carry up my bones from here.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(50,26);</script>So Joseph died, being one
hundred ten years old, and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin
in Egypt.
