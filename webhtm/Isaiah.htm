<h1>
Isaiah
</h1><p>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,1);</script>The vision of Isaiah the
son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of
Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
<dl>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,2);</script>Hear, heavens,
<dd>and listen, earth; for <a href="#N1">Yahweh</a> has spoken:
<dt>“I have nourished and brought up children,
<dd>and they have rebelled against me.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,3);</script>The ox knows his owner,
<dd>and the donkey his master’s crib;
<dd>but Israel doesn’t know,
<dd>my people don’t consider.”
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,4);</script>Ah sinful nation,
<dd>a people loaded with iniquity,
<dd>a seed of evildoers,
<dd>children who deal corruptly!
<dt>They have forsaken Yahweh.
<dd>They have despised the Holy One of Israel.
<dd>They are estranged and backward.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,5);</script>Why should you be
beaten more,
<dd>that you revolt more and more?
<dt>The whole head is sick,
<dd>and the whole heart faint.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,6);</script>From the sole of the
foot even to the head there is no soundness in it:
<dd>wounds, welts, and open sores.
<dd>They haven’t been closed, neither bandaged, neither soothed with oil.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,7);</script>Your country is
desolate.
<dd>Your cities are burned with fire.
<dd>Strangers devour your land in your presence,
<dd>and it is desolate,
<dd>as overthrown by strangers.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,8);</script>The daughter of Zion
is left like a shelter in a vineyard,
<dd>like a hut in a field of melons,
<dd>like a besieged city.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,9);</script>Unless Yahweh of
Armies had left to us a very small remnant,
<dd>we would have been as Sodom;
<dd>we would have been like Gomorrah.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,10);</script>Hear the word of
Yahweh, you rulers of Sodom!
<dd>Listen to the law of our <a href="#N2">God</a>, you people of Gomorrah!
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,11);</script>“What are the
multitude of your sacrifices to me?,” says Yahweh.
<dd>“I have had enough of the burnt offerings of rams,
<dd>and the fat of fed animals.
<dd>I don’t delight in the blood of bulls,
<dd>or of lambs,
<dd>or of male goats.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,12);</script>When you come to
appear before me,
<dd>who has required this at your hand, to trample my courts?
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,13);</script>Bring no more vain
offerings.
<dd>Incense is an abomination to me;
<dd>new moons, Sabbaths, and convocations:
<dd>I can’t bear with evil assemblies.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,14);</script>My soul hates your
New Moons and your appointed feasts.
<dd>They are a burden to me.
<dd>I am weary of bearing them.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,15);</script>When you spread forth
your hands, I will hide my eyes from you.
<dd>Yes, when you make many prayers, I will not hear.
<dd>Your hands are full of blood.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,16);</script>Wash yourselves, make
yourself clean.
<dd>Put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes.
<dd>Cease to do evil.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,17);</script>Learn to do well.
<dd>Seek justice.
<dd>Relieve the oppressed.
<dd>Judge the fatherless.
<dd>Plead for the widow.”
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,18);</script>“Come now, and let
us reason together,” says Yahweh:
<dd>“Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.
<dd>Though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,19);</script>If you are willing
and obedient,
<dd>you shall eat the good of the land;
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,20);</script>but if you refuse and
rebel, you shall be devoured with the sword;
<dd>for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it.”
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,21);</script>How the faithful city
has become a prostitute!
<dd>She was full of justice; righteousness lodged in her,
<dd>but now murderers.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,22);</script>Your silver has
become dross,
<dd>your wine mixed with water.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,23);</script>Your princes are
rebellious, and companions of thieves.
<dd>Everyone loves bribes, and follows after rewards.
<dd>They don’t judge the fatherless,
<dd>neither does the cause of the widow come to them.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,24);</script>Therefore the <a
href="#N3">Lord,</a> Yahweh of Armies,
<dd>the Mighty One of Israel, says:
<dt>“Ah, I will get relief from my adversaries,
<dd>and avenge myself of my enemies;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,25);</script>and I will turn my
hand on you,
<dd>thoroughly purge away your dross,
<dd>and will take away all your tin.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,26);</script>I will restore your
judges as at the first,
<dd>and your counselors as at the beginning.
<dt>Afterward you shall be called ‘The city of righteousness,
<dd>a faithful town.’
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,27);</script>Zion shall be
redeemed with justice,
<dd>and her converts with righteousness.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,28);</script>But the destruction
of transgressors and sinners shall be together,
<dd>and those who forsake Yahweh shall be consumed.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,29);</script>For they shall be
ashamed of the oaks which you have desired,
<dd>and you shall be confounded for the gardens that you have chosen.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,30);</script>For you shall be as
an oak whose leaf fades,
<dd>and as a garden that has no water.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,31);</script>The strong will be
like tinder,
<dd>and his work like a spark.
<dt>They will both burn together,
<dd>and no one will quench them.”
<dt>
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,1);</script>This is what Isaiah the
son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
<dl>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,2);</script>It shall happen in the
latter days, that the mountain of Yahweh’s house shall be established on
the top of the mountains,
<dd>and shall be raised above the hills;
<dd>and all nations shall flow to it.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,3);</script>Many peoples shall go
and say,
<dd>“Come, let’s go up to the mountain of Yahweh,
<dd>to the house of the God of Jacob;
<dd>and he will teach us of his ways,
<dd>and we will walk in his paths.”
<dt>For out of Zion the law shall go forth,
<dd>and the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,4);</script>He will judge between
the nations,
<dd>and will decide concerning many peoples;
<dd>and they shall beat their swords into plowshares,
<dd>and their spears into pruning hooks.
<dt>Nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
<dd>neither shall they learn war any more.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,5);</script>House of Jacob, come,
and let us walk in the light of Yahweh.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,6);</script>For you have forsaken
your people, the house of Jacob,
<dd>because they are filled from the east,
<dd>with those who practice divination like the Philistines,
<dd>and they clasp hands with the children of foreigners.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,7);</script>Their land is full of
silver and gold,
<dd>neither is there any end of their treasures.
<dt>Their land also is full of horses,
<dd>neither is there any end of their chariots.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,8);</script>Their land also is
full of idols.
<dd>They worship the work of their own hands,
<dd>that which their own fingers have made.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,9);</script>Man is brought low,
<dd>and mankind is humbled;
<dd>therefore don’t forgive them.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,10);</script>Enter into the rock,
<dd>and hide in the dust,
<dt>from before the terror of Yahweh,
<dd>and from the glory of his majesty.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,11);</script>The lofty looks of
man will be brought low,
<dd>the haughtiness of men will be bowed down,
<dd>and Yahweh alone will be exalted in that day.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,12);</script>For there will be a
day of Yahweh of Armies for all that is proud and haughty,
<dd>and for all that is lifted up;
<dd>and it shall be brought low:
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,13);</script>For all the cedars of
Lebanon, that are high and lifted up,
<dd>for all the oaks of Bashan,
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,14);</script>For all the high
mountains,
<dd>for all the hills that are lifted up,
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,15);</script>For every lofty tower,
<dd>for every fortified wall,
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,16);</script>For all the ships of
Tarshish,
<dd>and for all pleasant imagery.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,17);</script>The loftiness of man
shall be bowed down,
<dd>and the haughtiness of men shall be brought low;
<dd>and Yahweh alone shall be exalted in that day.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,18);</script>The idols shall
utterly pass away.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,19);</script>Men shall go into the
caves of the rocks,
<dd>and into the holes of the earth,
<dd>from before the terror of Yahweh,
<dd>and from the glory of his majesty,
<dd>when he arises to shake the earth mightily.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,20);</script>In that day, men
shall cast away their idols of silver,
<dd>and their idols of gold,
<dd>which have been made for themselves to worship,
<dd>to the moles and to the bats;
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,21);</script>To go into the
caverns of the rocks,
<dd>and into the clefts of the ragged rocks,
<dd>from before the terror of Yahweh,
<dd>and from the glory of his majesty,
<dd>when he arises to shake the earth mightily.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,22);</script>Stop trusting in man,
whose breath is in his nostrils;
<dd>for of what account is he?
<dt>
</dl>
<dl><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,1);</script>For, behold, the Lord,
Yahweh of Armies, takes away from Jerusalem and from Judah supply and
support,
<dd>the whole supply of bread,
<dd>and the whole supply of water;
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,2);</script>the mighty man,
<dd>the man of war,
<dd>the judge,
<dd>the prophet,
<dd>the diviner,
<dd>the elder,
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,3);</script>the captain of fifty,
<dd>the honorable man,
<dd>the counselor,
<dd>the skilled craftsman,
<dd>and the clever enchanter.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,4);</script>I will give boys to be
their princes,
<dd>and children shall rule over them.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,5);</script>The people will be
oppressed,
<dd>everyone by another,
<dd>and everyone by his neighbor.
<dt>The child will behave himself proudly against the old man,
<dd>and the base against the honorable.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,6);</script>Indeed a man shall
take hold of his brother in the house of his father, saying,
<dd>“You have clothing, you be our ruler,
<dd>and let this ruin be under your hand.”
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,7);</script>In that day he will
cry out, saying, “I will not be a healer;
<dd>for in my house is neither bread nor clothing.
<dd>You shall not make me ruler of the people.”
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,8);</script>For Jerusalem is
ruined, and Judah is fallen;
<dd>because their tongue and their doings are against Yahweh,
<dt>to provoke the eyes of his glory.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,9);</script>The look of their
faces testify against them.
<dd>They parade their sin like Sodom.
<dd>They don’t hide it.
<dd>Woe to their soul!
<dd>For they have brought disaster upon themselves.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,10);</script>Tell the righteous
“Good!”
<dd>For they shall eat the fruit of their deeds.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,11);</script>Woe to the wicked!
<dd>Disaster is upon them;
<dd>for the deeds of his hands will be paid back to him.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,12);</script>As for my people,
children are their oppressors,
<dd>and women rule over them.
<dd>My people, those who lead you cause you to err,
<dd>and destroy the way of your paths.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,13);</script>Yahweh stands up to
contend,
<dd>and stands to judge the peoples.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,14);</script>Yahweh will enter
into judgment with the elders of his people,
<dd>and their leaders:
<dd>“It is you who have eaten up the vineyard.
<dd>The spoil of the poor is in your houses.
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,15);</script>What do you mean that
you crush my people,
<dd>and grind the face of the poor?” says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,16);</script>Moreover Yahweh said,
“Because the daughters of Zion are haughty,
<dd>and walk with outstretched necks and flirting eyes,
<dd>walking to trip as they go,
<dd>jingling ornaments on their feet;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,17);</script>therefore the Lord
brings sores on the crown of the head of the women of Zion,
<dd>and Yahweh will make their scalps bald.”
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,18);</script>In that day the Lord
will take away the beauty of their anklets, the headbands, the crescent
necklaces, <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,19);</script>the earrings,
the bracelets, the veils, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,20);</script>the headdresses, the ankle
chains, the sashes, the perfume bottles, the charms, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,21);</script>the signet rings, the nose rings,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,22);</script>the fine robes, the
capes, the cloaks, the purses, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,23);</script>the hand mirrors, the fine linen
garments, the tiaras, and the shawls.
<dl>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,24);</script>It shall happen that
instead of sweet spices, there shall be rottenness;
<dd>instead of a belt, a rope;
<dd>instead of well set hair, baldness;
<dd>instead of a robe, a wearing of sackcloth;
<dd>and branding instead of beauty.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,25);</script>Your men shall fall
by the sword,
<dd>and your mighty in the war.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,26);</script>Her gates shall
lament and mourn;
<dd>and she shall be desolate and sit on the ground.
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,1);</script>Seven women shall take
hold of one man in that day, saying, “We will eat our own bread, and
wear our own clothing: only let us be called by your name. Take away our
reproach.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,2);</script>In that day, Yahweh’s
branch will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land will be
the beauty and glory of the survivors of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,3);</script>It will happen, that he who is
left in Zion, and he who remains in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even
everyone who is written among the living in Jerusalem; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,4);</script>when the Lord shall have washed
away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood
of Jerusalem from its midst, by the spirit of justice, and by the spirit
of burning. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,5);</script>Yahweh will
create over the whole habitation of Mount Zion, and over her assemblies, a
cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for
over all the glory will be a canopy. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,6);</script>There will be a pavilion for a
shade in the daytime from the heat, and for a refuge and for a shelter
from storm and from rain.
<p>
<dl><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,1);</script>Let me sing for my
well beloved a song of my beloved about his vineyard.
<dd>My beloved had a vineyard on a very fruitful hill.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,2);</script>He dug it up,
<dd>gathered out its stones,
<dd>planted it with the choicest vine,
<dd>built a tower in its midst,
<dd>and also cut out a winepress therein.
<dt>He looked for it to yield grapes,
<dd>but it yielded wild grapes.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,3);</script>“Now, inhabitants of
Jerusalem and men of Judah,
<dd>please judge between me and my vineyard.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,4);</script>What could have been
done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it?
<dd>Why, when I looked for it to yield grapes, did it yield wild grapes?
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,5);</script>Now I will tell you
what I will do to my vineyard.
<dd>I will take away its hedge, and it will be eaten up.
<dd>I will break down its wall of it, and it will be trampled down.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,6);</script>I will lay it a
wasteland.
<dd>It won’t be pruned nor hoed,
<dd>but it will grow briers and thorns.
<dd>I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain on it.”
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,7);</script>For the vineyard of
Yahweh of Armies is the house of Israel,
<dd>and the men of Judah his pleasant plant:
<dd>and he looked for justice, but, behold, oppression;
<dd>for righteousness, but, behold, a cry of distress.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,8);</script>Woe to those who join
house to house,
<dd>who lay field to field, until there is no room,
<dd>and you are made to dwell alone in the midst of the land!
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,9);</script>In my ears, Yahweh of
Armies says: “Surely many houses will be desolate,
<dd>even great and beautiful, unoccupied.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,10);</script>For <a href="#N4">ten
acres</a> of vineyard shall yield <a href="#N5">one bath,</a>
<dd>and a <a href="#N6">homer</a> of seed shall yield an <a
href="#N7">ephah.</a>”
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,11);</script>Woe to those who rise
up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink;
<dd>who stay late into the night, until wine inflames them!
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,12);</script>The harp, lyre,
tambourine, and flute, with wine, are at their feasts;
<dd>but they don’t respect the work of Yahweh,
<dd>neither have they considered the operation of his hands.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,13);</script>Therefore my people
go into captivity for lack of knowledge.
<dd>Their honorable men are famished,
<dd>and their multitudes are parched with thirst.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,14);</script>Therefore <a
href="#N8">Sheol</a> has enlarged its desire,
<dd>and opened its mouth without measure;
<dd>and their glory, their multitude, their pomp, and he who rejoices
among them, descend into it.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,15);</script>So man is brought low,
<dd>mankind is humbled,
<dd>and the eyes of the arrogant ones are humbled;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,16);</script>but Yahweh of Armies
is exalted in justice,
<dd>and God the Holy One is sanctified in righteousness.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,17);</script>Then the lambs will
graze as in their pasture,
<dd>and strangers will eat the ruins of the rich.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,18);</script>Woe to those who draw
iniquity with cords of falsehood,
<dd>and wickedness as with cart rope;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,19);</script>Who say, “Let him
make speed, let him hasten his work, that we may see it;
<dd>and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come,
<dd>that we may know it!”
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,20);</script>Woe to those who call
evil good, and good evil;
<dd>who put darkness for light,
<dd>and light for darkness;
<dt>who put bitter for sweet,
<dd>and sweet for bitter!
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,21);</script>Woe to those who are
wise in their own eyes,

<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,22);</script>Woe to those who are
mighty to drink wine,
<dd>and champions at mixing strong drink;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,23);</script>who acquit the guilty
for a bribe,
<dd>but deny justice for the innocent!
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,24);</script>Therefore as the
tongue of fire devours the stubble,

<dt>because they have rejected the law of Yahweh of Armies,
<dd>and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,25);</script>Therefore Yahweh’s
anger burns against his people,
<dd>and he has stretched out his hand against them, and has struck them.
<dt>The mountains tremble,
<dd>and their dead bodies are as refuse in the midst of the streets.
<dt>For all this, his anger is not turned away,
<dd>but his hand is still stretched out.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,26);</script>He will lift up a
banner to the nations from far,

<dd>Behold, they will come speedily and swiftly.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,27);</script>None shall be weary
nor stumble among them;

<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,28);</script>whose arrows are
sharp,

<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,29);</script>Their roaring will be
like a lioness.
<dd>They will roar like young lions.
<dt>Yes, they shall roar,
<dd>and seize their prey and carry it off,
<dd>and there will be no one to deliver.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,30);</script>They will roar
against them in that day like the roaring of the sea.
<dd>If one looks to the land behold, darkness and distress.
<dd>The light is darkened in its clouds.
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,1);</script>In the year that king
Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up; and
his train filled the temple. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,2);</script>Above him stood the seraphim. Each
one had six wings. With two he covered his face. With two he covered his
feet. With two he flew. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,3);</script>One called to another, and said,
<dl>
<dt>“Holy, holy, holy, is Yahweh of Armies!
<dd>The whole earth is full of his glory!”
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,4);</script>The foundations of the
thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled
with smoke. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,5);</script>Then I said,
“Woe is me! For I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips, and I
dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for my eyes have seen the
King, Yahweh of Armies!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,6);</script>Then one of the
seraphim flew to me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken
with the tongs from off the altar. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,7);</script>He touched my mouth with it, and
said, “Behold, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken
away, and your sin forgiven.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,8);</script>I heard the Lord’s
voice, saying, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?”
<p>Then I said, “Here I am. Send me!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,9);</script>He said, “Go, and
tell this people,
<dl>
<dt>‘You hear indeed,
<dd>but don’t understand;
<dt>and you see indeed,
<dd>but don’t perceive.’
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,10);</script>Make the heart of
this people fat.
<dd>Make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes;
<dt>lest they see with their eyes,
<dd>and hear with their ears,
<dd>and understand with their heart,
<dd>and turn again, and be healed.”
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,11);</script>Then I said, “Lord,
how long?”
<p>He answered,
<dl>
<dt>“Until cities are waste without inhabitant,
<dd>and houses without man,
<dd>and the land becomes utterly waste,
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,12);</script>And Yahweh has
removed men far away,
<dd>and the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,13);</script>If there is a tenth
left in it,
<dd>that also will in turn be consumed:
<dt>as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stock remains when they are
felled;
<dd>so the holy seed is its stock.”
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,1);</script>It happened in the days
of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin
the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up
to Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,2);</script>It was told the house of David,
saying, “Syria is allied with Ephraim.” His heart trembled, and the
heart of his people, as the trees of the forest tremble with the wind.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,3);</script>Then Yahweh said to
Isaiah, “Go out now to meet Ahaz, you, and Shearjashub your son, at the
end of the conduit of the upper pool, on the highway of the fuller’s
field. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,4);</script>Tell him, ‘Be
careful, and keep calm. Don’t be afraid, neither let your heart be faint
because of these two tails of smoking torches, for the fierce anger of
Rezin and Syria, and of the son of Remaliah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,5);</script>Because Syria, Ephraim, and the
son of Remaliah, have plotted evil against you, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,6);</script>“Let’s go up against Judah,
and tear it apart, and let’s divide it among ourselves, and set up a
king in its midst, even the son of Tabeel.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,7);</script>This is what the Lord Yahweh says:
“It shall not stand, neither shall it happen.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,8);</script>For the head of Syria is Damascus,
and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within sixty-five years Ephraim
shall be broken in pieces, so that it shall not be a people; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,9);</script>and the head of Ephraim is
Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah’s son. If you will not
believe, surely you shall not be established.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,10);</script>Yahweh spoke again to
Ahaz, saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,11);</script>“Ask a
sign of Yahweh your God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height
above.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,12);</script>But Ahaz said, “I
will not ask, neither will I tempt Yahweh.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,13);</script>He said, “Listen
now, house of David. Is it not enough for you to try the patience of men,
that you will try the patience of my God also? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,14);</script>Therefore the Lord himself will
give you a sign. Behold, the virgin will conceive, and bear a son, and
shall call his name <a href="#N9">Immanuel.</a> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,15);</script>He shall eat butter and honey
when he knows to refuse the evil, and choose the good. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,16);</script>For before the child knows to
refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land whose two kings you abhor
shall be forsaken. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,17);</script>Yahweh
will bring on you, on your people, and on your father’s house, days that
have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah; even the
king of Assyria. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,18);</script>It will
happen in that day that Yahweh will whistle for the fly that is in the
uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land
of Assyria. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,19);</script>They shall
come, and shall all rest in the desolate valleys, in the clefts of the
rocks, on all thorn hedges, and on all pastures. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,20);</script>In that day the Lord will shave
with a razor that is hired in the parts beyond the River, even with the
king of Assyria, the head and the hair of the feet; and it shall also
consume the beard. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,21);</script>It
shall happen in that day that a man shall keep alive a young cow, and two
sheep; <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,22);</script>and it shall
happen, that because of the abundance of milk which they shall give he
shall eat butter: for everyone will eat butter and honey that is left in
the midst of the land. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,23);</script>It
will happen in that day that every place where there were a thousand vines
at a thousand silver shekels, shall be for briers and thorns. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,24);</script>People will go there with arrows
and with bow, because all the land will be briers and thorns. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,25);</script>All the hills that were
cultivated with the hoe, you shall not come there for fear of briers and
thorns; but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the
treading of sheep.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,1);</script>Yahweh said to me,
“Take a large tablet, and write on it with a man’s pen, ‘<a
href="#N10">For Maher Shalal Hash Baz;</a>’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,2);</script>and I will take for myself
faithful witnesses to testify: Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of
Jeberechiah.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,3);</script>I went to the
prophetess, and she conceived, and bore a son. Then Yahweh said to me,
“Call his name ‘Maher Shalal Hash Baz.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,4);</script>For before the child knows how to
say, ‘My father,’ and, ‘My mother,’ the riches of Damascus and the
spoil of Samaria will be carried away by the king of Assyria.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,5);</script>Yahweh spoke to me yet
again, saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,6);</script>“Because
this people have refused the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice
in Rezin and Remaliah’s son; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,7);</script>now therefore, behold, the Lord
brings upon them the mighty flood waters of the River: the king of Assyria
and all his glory. It will come up over all its channels, and go over all
its banks. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,8);</script>It will sweep
onward into Judah. It will overflow and pass through; it will reach even
to the neck; and the stretching out of its wings will fill the breadth of
your land, Immanuel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,9);</script>Make
an uproar, you peoples, and be broken in pieces! Listen, all you from far
countries: dress for battle, and be shattered! Dress for battle, and be
shattered! <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,10);</script>Take counsel
together, and it will be brought to nothing; speak the word, and it will
not stand: for God is with us.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,11);</script>For Yahweh spoke thus to me with
a strong hand, and instructed me not to walk in the way of this people,
saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,12);</script>“Don’t say,
‘A conspiracy!’ concerning all about which this people say, ‘A
conspiracy!’ neither fear their threats, nor be terrorized. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,13);</script>Yahweh of Armies is who you must
respect as holy. He is the one you must fear. He is the one you must
dread. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,14);</script>He will be a
sanctuary, but for both houses of Israel, he will be a trap and a snare
for the inhabitants of Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,15);</script>Many will stumble over it, fall,
be broken, be snared, and be captured.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,16);</script>Wrap up the testimony. Seal the
law among my disciples. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,17);</script>I
will wait for Yahweh, who hides his face from the house of Jacob, and I
will look for him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,18);</script>Behold, I and the children whom
Yahweh has given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from Yahweh of
Armies, who dwells in Mount Zion.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,19);</script>When they tell you,
“Consult with those who have familiar spirits and with the wizards, who
chirp and who mutter:” shouldn’t a people consult with their God?
Should they consult the dead on behalf of the living? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,20);</script>Turn to the law and to the
testimony! If they don’t speak according to this word, surely there is
no morning for them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,21);</script>They
will pass through it, very distressed and hungry; and it will happen that
when they are hungry, they will worry, and curse by their king and by
their God. They will turn their faces upward, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,22);</script>and look to the earth, and see
distress, darkness, and the gloom of anguish. They will be driven into
thick darkness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,1);</script>But there shall be no
more gloom for her who was in anguish. In the former time, he brought into
contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali; but in the latter
time he has made it glorious, by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan,
Galilee of the nations.
<p>
<dl><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,2);</script>The people who walked
in darkness have seen a great light.
<dd>Those who lived in the land of the shadow of death, on them the light
has shined.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,3);</script>You have multiplied
the nation.
<dd>You have increased their joy.
</dl>
<p>They rejoice before you according to the joy in harvest, as men rejoice
when they divide the spoil. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,4);</script>For the yoke of his burden, and
the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, you have broken as in
the day of Midian. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,5);</script>For all
the armor of the armed man in the noisy battle, and the garments rolled in
blood, will be for burning, fuel for the fire. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,6);</script>For to us a child is born. To us a
son is given; and the government will be on his shoulders. His name will
be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of
Peace. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,7);</script>Of the increase of
his government and of peace there shall be no end, on the throne of David,
and on his kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it with justice and
with righteousness from that time on, even forever. The zeal of Yahweh of
Armies will perform this.
<p>
<dl><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,8);</script>The Lord sent a word
into Jacob,
<dd>and it falls on Israel.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,9);</script>All the people will
know,
<dd>including Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria, who say in pride and
in arrogance of heart,
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,10);</script>“The bricks have
fallen,
<dd>but we will build with cut stone.
<dt>The sycamore fig trees have been cut down,
<dd>but we will put cedars in their place.”
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,11);</script>Therefore Yahweh will
set up on high against him the adversaries of Rezin,
<dd>and will stir up his enemies,
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,12);</script>The Syrians in front,
<dd>and the Philistines behind;
<dd>and they will devour Israel with open mouth.
<dt>For all this, his anger is not turned away,
<dd>but his hand is stretched out still.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,13);</script>Yet the people have
not turned to him who struck them,
<dd>neither have they sought Yahweh of Armies.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,14);</script>Therefore Yahweh will
cut off from Israel head and tail,
<dd>palm branch and reed, in one day.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,15);</script>The elder and the
honorable man is the head,
<dd>and the prophet who teaches lies is the tail.

this people lead them astray;
<dd>and those who are led by them are destroyed.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,17);</script>Therefore the Lord
will not rejoice over their young men,
<dd>neither will he have compassion on their fatherless and widows;
<dt>for everyone is profane and an evildoer,
<dd>and every mouth speaks folly.
<dt>For all this his anger is not turned away,
<dd>but his hand is stretched out still.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,18);</script>For wickedness burns
like a fire.
<dd>It devours the briers and thorns;
<dd>yes, it kindles in the thickets of the forest,
<dd>and they roll upward in a column of smoke.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,19);</script>Through the wrath of
Yahweh of Armies, the land is burnt up;
<dd>and the people are the fuel for the fire.
<dd>No one spares his brother.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,20);</script>One will devour on
the right hand, and be hungry;

<dt>Everyone will eat the flesh of his own arm:
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,21);</script>Manasseh, Ephraim;

<dt>For all this his anger is not turned away,
<dd>but his hand is stretched out still.
</dl>
<p> <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,1);</script>Woe to those who
decree unrighteous decrees, and to the writers who write oppressive
decrees; <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,2);</script>to deprive the
needy from justice, and to rob the poor among my people of their rights,
that widows may be their spoil, and that they may make the fatherless
their prey! <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,3);</script>What will you
do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation which will come from
afar? To whom will you flee for help? Where will you leave your wealth?
<p>
<dl><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,4);</script>They will only bow
down under the prisoners,
<dd>and will fall under the slain.
<dt>For all this his anger is not turned away,
<dd>but his hand is stretched out still.
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,5);</script>Alas Assyrian, the rod
of my anger, the staff in whose hand is my indignation! <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,6);</script>I will send him against a profane
nation, and against the people who anger me will I give him a command to
take the spoil and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire
of the streets. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,7);</script>However
he doesn’t mean so, neither does his heart think so; but it is in his
heart to destroy, and to cut off not a few nations. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,8);</script>For he says, “Aren’t all of
my princes kings? <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,9);</script>Isn’t
Calno like Carchemish? Isn’t Hamath like Arpad? Isn’t Samaria like
Damascus?” <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,10);</script>As my hand
has found the kingdoms of the idols, whose engraved images exceeded those
of Jerusalem and of Samaria; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,11);</script>shall I not, as I have done to
Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,12);</script>Therefore it will happen that,
when the Lord has performed his whole work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem,
I will punish the fruit of the willful proud heart of the king of Assyria,
and the insolence of his haughty looks. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,13);</script>For he has said, “By the
strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I have
understanding: and I have removed the boundaries of the peoples, and have
robbed their treasures. Like a valiant man I have brought down their
rulers. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,14);</script>My hand has
found the riches of the peoples like a nest, and like one gathers eggs
that are abandoned, have I gathered all the earth. There was no one who
moved their wing, or that opened their mouth, or chirped.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,15);</script>Should an axe brag
against him who chops with it? Should a saw exalt itself above him who
saws with it? As if a rod should lift those who lift it up, or as if a
staff should lift up someone who is not wood. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,16);</script>Therefore the Lord, Yahweh of
Armies, will send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory a
burning will be kindled like the burning of fire. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,17);</script>The light of Israel will be for
a fire, and his Holy One for a flame; and it will burn and devour his
thorns and his briers in one day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,18);</script>He will consume the glory of his
forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body. It will be as when
a standard bearer faints. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,19);</script>The remnant of the trees of his
forest shall be few, so that a child could write their number.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,20);</script>It will come to pass
in that day that the remnant of Israel, and those who have escaped from
the house of Jacob will no more again lean on him who struck them, but
shall lean on Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel, in truth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,21);</script>A remnant will return, even the
remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,22);</script>For though your people, Israel,
are like the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will return. A
destruction is determined, overflowing with righteousness. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,23);</script>For the Lord, Yahweh of Armies,
will make a full end, and that determined, in the midst of all the earth.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(10,24);</script>Therefore the Lord,
Yahweh of Armies, says “My people who dwell in Zion, don’t be afraid
of the Assyrian, though he strike you with the rod, and lift up his staff
against you, as Egypt did. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,25);</script>For yet a very little while, and
the indignation against you will be accomplished, and my anger will be
directed to his destruction.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,26);</script>Yahweh of Armies will stir up a
scourge against him, as in the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb.
His rod will be over the sea, and he will lift it up like he did against
Egypt. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,27);</script>It will happen in
that day, that his burden will depart from off your shoulder, and his yoke
from off your neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the
anointing oil.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,28);</script>He has come to Aiath.
He has passed through Migron. At Michmash he stores his baggage. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,29);</script>They have gone over the pass.
They have taken up their lodging at Geba. Ramah trembles. Gibeah of Saul
has fled. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,30);</script>Cry aloud with
your voice, daughter of Gallim! Listen, Laishah! You poor Anathoth!
<script type="text/javascript">cb(10,31);</script>Madmenah is a fugitive.
The inhabitants of Gebim flee for safety. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,32);</script>This very day he will halt at
Nob. He shakes his hand at the mountain of the daughter of Zion, the hill
of Jerusalem. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,33);</script>Behold,
the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, will lop the boughs with terror. The tall will
be cut down, and the lofty will be brought low. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,34);</script>He will cut down the thickets of
the forest with iron, and Lebanon will fall by the Mighty One.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,1);</script>
<dl>A shoot will come out of the stock of Jesse,
<dd>and a branch out of his roots will bear fruit.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,2);</script>The Spirit of Yahweh

in the fear of Yahweh.
<dt>He will not judge by the sight of his eyes,
<dd>neither decide by the hearing of his ears;

righteousness he will judge the poor,
<dd>and decide with equity for the humble of the earth.
<dt>He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth;
<dd>and with the breath of his lips he will kill the wicked.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,5);</script>Righteousness will be
the belt of his waist,

<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,6);</script>The wolf will live

</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,10);</script>It will happen in
that day that the nations will seek the root of Jesse, who stands as a
banner of the peoples; and his resting place will be glorious. <script

the Lord will set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant
that is left of his people from Assyria, from Egypt, from Pathros, from
Cush, from Elam, from Shinar, from Hamath, and from the islands of the
sea. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,12);</script>He will set up a
banner for the nations, and will assemble the outcasts of Israel, and
gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,13);</script>The envy also of Ephraim
will depart, and those who persecute Judah will be cut off. Ephraim
won’t envy Judah, and Judah won’t persecute Ephraim. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,14);</script>They will fly down on the
shoulders of the Philistines on the west. Together they will plunder the
children of the east. They will extend their power over Edom and Moab, and
the children of Ammon will obey them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,15);</script>Yahweh will utterly destroy the
tongue of the Egyptian sea; and with his scorching wind he will wave his
hand over the River, and will split it into seven streams, and cause men
to march over in sandals. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,16);</script>There will be a highway for the
remnant that is left of his people from Assyria, like there was for Israel
in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,1);</script>In that day you will
say, “I will give thanks to you, Yahweh; for though you were angry with
me, your anger has turned away and you comfort me. <script

will trust, and will not be afraid; for Yah, Yahweh, is my strength and
song; and he has become my salvation.” <script

water out of the wells of salvation. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,4);</script>In that day you will say, “Give
thanks to Yahweh! Call on his name. Declare his doings among the peoples.
Proclaim that his name is exalted! <script

excellent things! Let this be known in all the earth! <script

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,1);</script>The burden of Babylon,
which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,2);</script>Set up a banner on the bare
mountain! Lift up your voice to them! Wave your hand, that they may go
into the gates of the nobles. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,3);</script>I have commanded my consecrated
ones; yes, I have called my mighty men for my anger, even my proudly
exulting ones. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,4);</script>The noise
of a multitude is in the mountains, as of a great people; the noise of an
uproar of the kingdoms of the nations gathered together! Yahweh of Armies
is mustering the army for the battle. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,5);</script>They come from a far country,
from the uttermost part of heaven, even Yahweh, and the weapons of his
indignation, to destroy the whole land. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,6);</script>Wail; for the day of Yahweh is at
hand! It will come as destruction from the Almighty. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,7);</script>Therefore all hands will be
feeble, and everyone’s heart will melt. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,8);</script>They will be dismayed. Pangs and
sorrows will seize them. They will be in pain like a woman in labor. They
will look in amazement one at another. Their faces will be faces of flame.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,9);</script>Behold, the day of Yahweh
comes, cruel, with wrath and fierce anger; to make the land a desolation,
and to destroy its sinners out of it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,10);</script>For the stars of the sky and its
constellations will not give their light. The sun will be darkened in its
going forth, and the moon will not cause its light to shine. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,11);</script>I will punish the world for
their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity. I will cause the arrogance
of the proud to cease, and will humble the haughtiness of the terrible.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,12);</script>I will make people more
rare than fine gold, even a person than the pure gold of Ophir. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,13);</script>Therefore I will make the
heavens tremble, and the earth will be shaken out of its place in the
wrath of Yahweh of Armies, and in the day of his fierce anger. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,14);</script>It will happen that like a
hunted gazelle, and like sheep that no one gathers, they will each turn to
their own people, and will each flee to their own land. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,15);</script>Everyone who is found will be
thrust through. Everyone who is captured will fall by the sword. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,16);</script>Their infants also will be
dashed in pieces before their eyes. Their houses will be ransacked, and
their wives raped. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,17);</script>Behold, I will stir up the Medes
against them, who will not value silver, and as for gold, they will not
delight in it. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,18);</script>Their
bows will dash the young men in pieces; and they shall have no pity on the
fruit of the womb. Their eyes will not spare children. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,19);</script>Babylon, the glory of kingdoms,
the beauty of the Chaldeans’ pride, will be like when God overthrew
Sodom and Gomorrah. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,20);</script>It
will never be inhabited, neither will it be lived in from generation to
generation. The Arabian will not pitch a tent there, neither will
shepherds make their flocks lie down there. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,21);</script>But wild animals of the desert
will lie there, and their houses will be full of jackals. Ostriches will
dwell there, and wild goats will frolic there. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,22);</script>Wolves will cry in their
castles, and jackals in the pleasant palaces. Her time is near to come,
and her days will not be prolonged.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,1);</script>For Yahweh will have
compassion on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel, and set them in their own
land. The foreigner will join himself with them, and they will unite with
the house of Jacob. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,2);</script>The
peoples will take them, and bring them to their place. The house of Israel
will possess them in Yahweh’s land for servants and for handmaids. They
will take as captives those whose captives they were; and they shall rule
over their oppressors. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,3);</script>It
will happen in the day that Yahweh will give you rest from your sorrow,
from your trouble, and from the hard service in which you were made to
serve, <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,4);</script>that you will take
up this parable against the king of Babylon, and say, “How the oppressor
has ceased! The golden city has ceased!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,5);</script>Yahweh has broken the staff of
the wicked, the scepter of the rulers, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,6);</script>who struck the peoples in wrath
with a continual stroke, who ruled the nations in anger, with a
persecution that none restrained. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,7);</script>The whole earth is at rest, and
is quiet. They break out song. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,8);</script>Yes, the fir trees rejoice with
you, with the cedars of Lebanon, saying, “Since you are humbled, no
lumberjack has come up against us.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,9);</script><a href="#N11">Sheol</a> from
beneath has moved for you to meet you at your coming. It stirs up the dead
for you, even all the rulers of the earth. It has raised up from their
thrones all the kings of the nations. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,10);</script>They all will answer and ask
you, “Have you also become as weak as we are? Have you become like
us?” <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,11);</script>Your pomp is
brought down to <a href="#N12">Sheol</a>, with the sound of your stringed
instruments. Maggots are spread out under you, and worms cover you.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,12);</script>How you have fallen
from heaven, morning star, son of the dawn! How you are cut down to the
ground, who laid the nations low! <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,13);</script>You said in your heart, “I
will ascend into heaven! I will exalt my throne above the stars of God! I
will sit on the mountain of assembly, in the far north! <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,14);</script>I will ascend above the heights
of the clouds! I will make myself like the Most High!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,15);</script>Yet you shall be brought down to
<a href="#N13">Sheol</a>, to the depths of the pit. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,16);</script>Those who see you will stare at
you. They will ponder you, saying, “Is this the man who made the earth
to tremble, who shook kingdoms; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,17);</script>who made the world like a
wilderness, and overthrew its cities; who didn’t release his prisoners
to their home?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,18);</script>All the kings of the
nations, sleep in glory, everyone in his own house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,19);</script>But you are cast away from your
tomb like an abominable branch, clothed with the slain, who are thrust
through with the sword, who go down to the stones of the pit; like a dead
body trodden under foot. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,20);</script>You will not join them in
burial, because you have destroyed your land. You have killed your people.
The seed of evildoers will not be named forever. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,21);</script>Prepare for slaughter of his
children because of the iniquity of their fathers, that they not rise up
and possess the earth, and fill the surface of the world with cities.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(14,22);</script>“I will rise up
against them,” says Yahweh of Armies, “and cut off from Babylon name
and remnant, and son and son’s son,” says Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,23);</script>“I will also make it a
possession for the porcupine, and pools of water. I will sweep it with the
broom of destruction,” says Yahweh of Armies. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,24);</script>Yahweh of Armies has sworn,
saying, “Surely, as I have thought, so shall it happen; and as I have
purposed, so shall it stand: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,25);</script>that I will break the Assyrian
in my land, and tread him under foot on my mountains. Then his yoke will
leave them, and his burden leave their shoulders. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,26);</script>This is the plan that is
determined for the whole earth. This is the hand that is stretched out
over all the nations. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,27);</script>For Yahweh of Armies has
planned, and who can stop it? His hand is stretched out, and who can turn
it back?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,28);</script>This burden was in
the year that king Ahaz died. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,29);</script>Don’t rejoice, O Philistia,
all of you, because the rod that struck you is broken; for out of the
serpent’s root an adder will emerge, and his fruit will be a fiery
flying serpent. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,30);</script>The
firstborn of the poor will eat, and the needy will lie down in safety; and
I will kill your root with famine, and your remnant will be killed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,31);</script>Howl, gate! Cry,
city! You are melted away, Philistia, all of you; for smoke comes out of
the north, and there is no straggler in his ranks. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,32);</script>What will they answer the
messengers of the nation? That Yahweh has founded Zion, and in her the
afflicted of his people will take refuge.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,1);</script>The burden of Moab:
for in a night, Ar of Moab is laid waste, and brought to nothing; for in a
night Kir of Moab is laid waste, and brought to nothing. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,2);</script>They have gone up to Bayith, and
to Dibon, to the high places, to weep. Moab wails over Nebo and over
Medeba. Baldness is on all of their heads. Every beard is cut off. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,3);</script>In their streets, they clothe
themselves in sackcloth. In their streets and on their housetops, everyone
wails, weeping abundantly. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,4);</script>Heshbon cries out with Elealeh.
Their voice is heard even to Jahaz. Therefore the armed men of Moab cry
aloud. Their souls tremble within them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,5);</script>My heart cries out for Moab! Her
nobles flee to Zoar, to Eglath Shelishiyah; for they go up by the ascent
of Luhith with weeping; for in the way of Horonaim, they raise up a cry of
destruction. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,6);</script>For the
waters of Nimrim will be desolate; for the grass has withered away, the
tender grass fails, there is no green thing. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,7);</script>Therefore they will carry away
the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have stored up, over
the brook of the willows. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,8);</script>For the cry has gone around the
borders of Moab; its wailing to Eglaim, and its wailing to Beer Elim.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(15,9);</script>For the waters of Dimon
are full of blood; for I will bring yet more on Dimon, a lion on those of
Moab who escape, and on the remnant of the land.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,1);</script>Send the lambs for the
ruler of the land from Selah to the wilderness, to the mountain of the
daughter of Zion. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,2);</script>For it
will be that as wandering birds, as a scattered nest, so will the
daughters of Moab be at the fords of the Arnon. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,3);</script>Give counsel! Execute justice!
Make your shade like the night in the midst of the noonday! Hide the
outcasts! Don’t betray the fugitive! <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,4);</script>Let my outcasts dwell with you!
As for Moab, be a hiding place for him from the face of the destroyer. For
the extortioner is brought to nothing. Destruction ceases. The oppressors
are consumed out of the land. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,5);</script>A throne will be established in
loving kindness. One will sit on it in truth, in the tent of David,
judging, seeking justice, and swift to do righteousness.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,6);</script>We have heard of the
pride of Moab, that he is very proud; even of his arrogance, his pride,
and his wrath. His boastings are nothing. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,7);</script>Therefore Moab will wail for
Moab. Everyone will wail. You will mourn for the raisin cakes of Kir
Hareseth, utterly stricken. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,8);</script>For the fields of Heshbon
languish with the vine of Sibmah. The lords of the nations have broken
down its choice branches, which reached even to Jazer, which wandered into
the wilderness. Its shoots were spread abroad. They passed over the sea.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(16,9);</script>Therefore I will weep
with the weeping of Jazer for the vine of Sibmah. I will water you with my
tears, Heshbon, and Elealeh: for on your summer fruits and on your harvest
the battle shout has fallen. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,10);</script>Gladness is taken away, and joy
out of the fruitful field; and in the vineyards there will be no singing,
neither joyful noise. Nobody will tread out wine in the presses. I have
made the shouting stop. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,11);</script>Therefore my heart sounds like a
harp for Moab, and my inward parts for Kir Heres. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,12);</script>It will happen that when Moab
presents himself, when he wearies himself on the high place, and comes to
his sanctuary to pray, that he will not prevail. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,13);</script>This is the word that Yahweh
spoke concerning Moab in time past. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,14);</script>But now Yahweh has spoken,
saying, “Within three years, as a worker bound by contract would count
them, the glory of Moab shall be brought into contempt, with all his great
multitude; and the remnant will be very small and feeble.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,1);</script>The burden of
Damascus: “Behold, Damascus is taken away from being a city, and it will
be a ruinous heap. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,2);</script>The
cities of Aroer are forsaken. They will be for flocks, which shall lie
down, and none shall make them afraid. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,3);</script>The fortress shall cease from
Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria. They
will be as the glory of the children of Israel,” says Yahweh of Armies.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(17,4);</script>“It will happen in that
day that the glory of Jacob will be made thin, and the fatness of his
flesh will become lean. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,5);</script>It will be like when the
harvester gathers the wheat, and his arm reaps the grain. Yes, it will be
like when one gleans grain in the valley of Rephaim. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,6);</script>Yet gleanings will be left there,
like the shaking of an olive tree, two or three olives in the top of the
uppermost bough, four or five in the outermost branches of a fruitful
tree,” says Yahweh, the God of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,7);</script>In that day, people will look to
their Maker, and their eyes will have respect for the Holy One of Israel.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(17,8);</script>They will not look to the
altars, the work of their hands; neither shall they respect that which
their fingers have made, either the Asherim, or the incense altars.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(17,9);</script>In that day, their strong
cities will be like the forsaken places in the woods and on the mountain
top, which were forsaken from before the children of Israel; and it will
be a desolation. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,10);</script>For you
have forgotten the God of your salvation, and have not remembered the rock
of your strength. Therefore you plant pleasant plants, and set out foreign
seedlings. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,11);</script>In the day of
your planting, you hedge it in. In the morning, you make your seed
blossom, but the harvest flees away in the day of grief and of desperate
sorrow. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,12);</script>Ah, the uproar
of many peoples, who roar like the roaring of the seas; and the rushing of
nations, that rush like the rushing of mighty waters! <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,13);</script>The nations will rush like the
rushing of many waters: but he will rebuke them, and they will flee far
off, and will be chased like the chaff of the mountains before the wind,
and like the whirling dust before the storm. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,14);</script>At evening, behold, terror!
Before the morning, they are no more. This is the portion of those who
plunder us, and the lot of those who rob us.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,1);</script>Ah, the land of the
rustling of wings, which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,2);</script>that sends ambassadors by the
sea, even in vessels of papyrus on the waters, saying, “Go, you swift
messengers, to a nation tall and smooth, to a people awesome from their
beginning onward, a nation that measures out and treads down, whose land
the rivers divide!” <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,3);</script>All
you inhabitants of the world, and you dwellers on the earth, when a banner
is lifted up on the mountains, look! When the trumpet is blown, listen!
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,4);</script>For Yahweh said to me,
“I will be still, and I will see in my dwelling place, like clear heat
in sunshine, like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,5);</script>For before the harvest, when the
blossom is over, and the flower becomes a ripening grape, he will cut off
the sprigs with pruning hooks, and he will cut down and take away the
spreading branches. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,6);</script>They
will be left together for the ravenous birds of the mountains, and for the
animals of the earth. The ravenous birds will summer on them, and all the
animals of the earth will winter on them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,7);</script>In that time, a present will be
brought to Yahweh of Armies from a people tall and smooth, even from a
people awesome from their beginning onward, a nation that measures out and
treads down, whose land the rivers divide, to the place of the name of
Yahweh of Armies, Mount Zion.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,1);</script>The burden of Egypt:
“Behold, Yahweh rides on a swift cloud, and comes to Egypt. The idols of
Egypt will tremble at his presence; and the heart of Egypt will melt in
its midst. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,2);</script>I will stir up
the Egyptians against the Egyptians, and they will fight everyone against
his brother, and everyone against his neighbor; city against city, and
kingdom against kingdom. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,3);</script>The spirit of Egypt will fail in
its midst. I will destroy its counsel. They will seek the idols, the
charmers, those who have familiar spirits, and the wizards. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,4);</script>I will give over the Egyptians
into the hand of a cruel lord. A fierce king will rule over them,” says
the Lord, Yahweh of Armies. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,5);</script>The waters will fail from the
sea, and the river will be wasted and become dry. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,6);</script>The rivers will become foul. The
streams of Egypt will be diminished and dried up. The reeds and flags will
wither away. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,7);</script>The meadows
by the Nile, by the brink of the Nile, and all the sown fields of the
Nile, will become dry, be driven away, and be no more. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,8);</script>The fishermen will lament, and
all those who fish in the Nile will mourn, and those who spread nets on
the waters will languish. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,9);</script>Moreover those who work in combed
flax, and those who weave white cloth, will be confounded. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,10);</script>The pillars will be broken in
pieces. All those who work for hire will be grieved in soul. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,11);</script>The princes of Zoan are utterly
foolish. The counsel of the wisest counselors of Pharaoh has become
stupid. How do you say to Pharaoh, “I am the son of the wise, the son of
ancient kings?” <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,12);</script>Where
then are your wise men? Let them tell you now; and let them know what
Yahweh of Armies has purposed concerning Egypt. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,13);</script>The princes of Zoan have become
fools. The princes of Memphis are deceived. They have caused Egypt to go
astray, who are the cornerstone of her tribes. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,14);</script>Yahweh has mixed a spirit of
perverseness in the midst of her; and they have caused Egypt to go astray
in all of its works, like a drunken man staggers in his vomit. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,15);</script>Neither shall there be any work
for Egypt, which head or tail, palm branch or rush, may do. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,16);</script>In that day the Egyptians will
be like women. They will tremble and fear because of the shaking of the
hand of Yahweh of Armies, which he shakes over them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,17);</script>The land of Judah will become a
terror to Egypt. Everyone to whom mention is made of it will be afraid,
because of the plans of Yahweh of Armies, which he determines against it.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(19,18);</script>In that day, there will
be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak the language of Canaan, and
swear to Yahweh of Armies. One will be called “The city of
destruction.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,19);</script>In that
day, there will be an altar to Yahweh in the midst of the land of Egypt,
and a pillar to Yahweh at its border. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,20);</script>It will be for a sign and for a
witness to Yahweh of Armies in the land of Egypt; for they will cry to
Yahweh because of oppressors, and he will send them a savior and a
defender, and he will deliver them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,21);</script>Yahweh will be known to Egypt,
and the Egyptians will know Yahweh in that day. Yes, they will worship
with sacrifice and offering, and will vow a vow to Yahweh, and will
perform it. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,22);</script>Yahweh will
strike Egypt, striking and healing. They will return to Yahweh, and he
will be entreated by them, and will heal them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,23);</script>In that day there will be a
highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt,
and the Egyptian into Assyria; and the Egyptians will worship with the
Assyrians. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,24);</script>In that day,
Israel will be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, a blessing in the
midst of the earth; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,25);</script>because Yahweh of Armies has
blessed them, saying, “Blessed be Egypt my people, Assyria the work of
my hands, and Israel my inheritance.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,1);</script>In the year that
Tartan came to Ashdod, when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him, and he
fought against Ashdod and took it; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,2);</script>at that time Yahweh spoke by
Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, “Go, and loosen the sackcloth from off
your waist, and take your shoes from off your feet.” He did so, walking
naked and barefoot. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,3);</script>Yahweh said, “As my servant
Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and a wonder
concerning Egypt and concerning Ethiopia, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,4);</script>so the king of Assyria will lead
away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Ethiopia, young and old,
naked and barefoot, and with buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(20,5);</script>They will be dismayed and
confounded, because of Ethiopia their expectation, and of Egypt their
glory. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,6);</script>The inhabitants of
this coast land will say in that day, ‘Behold, this is our expectation,
where we fled for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria. And we,
how will we escape?’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,1);</script>The burden of the
wilderness of the sea. As whirlwinds in the South sweep through, it comes
from the wilderness, from an awesome land. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,2);</script>A grievous vision is declared to
me. The treacherous man deals treacherously, and the destroyer destroys.
Go up, Elam; attack! I have stopped all of Media’s sighing. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,3);</script>Therefore my thighs are filled
with anguish. Pains have taken hold on me, like the pains of a woman in
labor. I am in so much pain that I can’t hear. I so am dismayed that I
can’t see. <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,4);</script>My heart
flutters. Horror has frightened me. The twilight that I desired has been
turned into trembling for me. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,5);</script>They prepare the table. They set
the watch. They eat. They drink. Rise up, you princes, oil the shield!
<script type="text/javascript">cb(21,6);</script>For the Lord said to me,
“Go, set a watchman. Let him declare what he sees. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,7);</script>When he sees a troop, horsemen in
pairs, a troop of donkeys, a troop of camels, he shall listen diligently
with great attentiveness.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,8);</script>He cried like a lion: “Lord, I
stand continually on the watchtower in the daytime, and every night I stay
at my post. <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,9);</script>Behold, here
comes a troop of men, horsemen in pairs.” He answered, “Fallen, fallen
is Babylon; and all the engraved images of her gods are broken to the
ground. <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,10);</script>You are my
threshing, and the grain of my floor!” That which I have heard from
Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, I have declared to you.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,11);</script>The burden of Dumah.
One calls to me out of Seir, “Watchman, what of the night? Watchman,
what of the night?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,12);</script>The watchman said, “The
morning comes, and also the night. If you will inquire, inquire. Come back
again.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,13);</script>The burden on Arabia.
In the forest in Arabia you will lodge, you caravans of Dedanites. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,14);</script>They brought water to him who
was thirsty. The inhabitants of the land of Tema met the fugitives with
their bread. <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,15);</script>For they
fled away from the swords, from the drawn sword, from the bent bow, and
from the heat of battle. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,16);</script>For the Lord said to me,
“Within a year, as a worker bound by contract would count it, all the
glory of Kedar will fail, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,17);</script>and the residue of the number of
the archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, will be few; for
Yahweh, the God of Israel, has spoken it.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,1);</script>The burden of the
valley of vision. What ails you now, that you have all gone up to the
housetops? <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,2);</script>You that are
full of shouting, a tumultuous city, a joyous town; your slain are not
slain with the sword, neither are they dead in battle. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,3);</script>All your rulers fled away
together. They were bound by the archers. All who were found by you were
bound together. They fled far away. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,4);</script>Therefore I said, “Look away
from me. I will weep bitterly. Don’t labor to comfort me for the
destruction of the daughter of my people. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,5);</script>For it is a day of confusion, and
of treading down, and of perplexity, from the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, in
the valley of vision; a breaking down of the walls, and a crying to the
mountains.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,6);</script>Elam
carried his quiver, with chariots of men and horsemen; and Kir uncovered
the shield. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,7);</script>It happened
that your choicest valleys were full of chariots, and the horsemen set
themselves in array at the gate. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,8);</script>He took away the covering of
Judah; and you looked in that day to the armor in the house of the forest.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(22,9);</script>You saw the breaches of
the city of David, that they were many; and you gathered together the
waters of the lower pool. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,10);</script>You numbered the houses of
Jerusalem, and you broke down the houses to fortify the wall. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,11);</script>You also made a reservoir
between the two walls for the water of the old pool. But you didn’t look
to him who had done this, neither did you have respect for him who
purposed it long ago. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,12);</script>In
that day, the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, called to weeping, and to mourning,
and to baldness, and to dressing in sackcloth: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,13);</script>and behold, joy and gladness,
killing cattle and killing sheep, eating flesh and drinking wine: “Let
us eat and drink, for tomorrow we will die.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,14);</script>Yahweh of Armies revealed
himself in my ears, “Surely this iniquity will not be forgiven you until
you die,” says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,15);</script>Thus says the Lord,
Yahweh of Armies, “Go, get yourself to this treasurer, even to Shebna,
who is over the house, and say, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,16);</script>‘What are you doing here? Who
has you here, that you have dug out a tomb here?’ Cutting himself out a
tomb on high, chiseling a habitation for himself in the rock!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,17);</script>Behold, Yahweh will overcome you
and hurl you away violently. Yes, he will grasp you firmly. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,18);</script>He will surely wind you around
and around, and throw you like a ball into a large country. There you will
die, and there the chariots of your glory will be, you shame of your
lord’s house. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,19);</script>I will
thrust you from your office. You will be pulled down from your station.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,20);</script>It will happen in
that day that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,21);</script>and I will clothe him with your
robe, and strengthen him with your belt. I will commit your government
into his hand; and he will be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
and to the house of Judah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,22);</script>I will lay the key of the house
of David on his shoulder. He will open, and no one will shut. He will
shut, and no one will open. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,23);</script>I will fasten him like a nail in
a sure place. He will be for a throne of glory to his father’s house.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(22,24);</script>They will hang on him
all the glory of his father’s house, the offspring and the issue, every
small vessel, from the cups even to all the pitchers. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,25);</script>“In that day,” says Yahweh
of Armies, “the nail that was fastened in a sure place will give way. It
will be cut down, and fall. The burden that was on it will be cut off, for
Yahweh has spoken it.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,1);</script>The burden of Tyre.
Howl, you ships of Tarshish! For it is laid waste, so that there is no
house, no entering in. From the land of Kittim it is revealed to them.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(23,2);</script>Be still, you inhabitants
of the coast, you whom the merchants of Sidon, that pass over the sea,
have replenished. <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,3);</script>On
great waters, the seed of the Shihor, the harvest of the Nile, was her
revenue. She was the market of nations. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,4);</script>Be ashamed, Sidon; for the sea
has spoken, the stronghold of the sea, saying, “I have not travailed,
nor brought forth, neither have I nourished young men, nor brought up
virgins.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,5);</script>When the
report comes to Egypt, they will be in anguish at the report of Tyre.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(23,6);</script>Pass over to Tarshish!
Wail, you inhabitants of the coast! <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,7);</script>Is this your joyous city, whose
antiquity is of ancient days, whose feet carried her far away to travel?
<script type="text/javascript">cb(23,8);</script>Who has planned this
against Tyre, the giver of crowns, whose merchants are princes, whose
traffickers are the honorable of the earth? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,9);</script>Yahweh of Armies has planned it,
to stain the pride of all glory, to bring into contempt all the honorable
of the earth. <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,10);</script>Pass
through your land like the Nile, daughter of Tarshish. There is no
restraint any more. <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,11);</script>He
has stretched out his hand over the sea. He has shaken the kingdoms.
Yahweh has ordered the destruction of Canaan’s strongholds. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,12);</script>He said, “You shall rejoice no
more, you oppressed virgin daughter of Sidon. Arise, pass over to Kittim.
Even there you will have no rest.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,13);</script>Behold, the land of
the Chaldeans. This people was not. The Assyrians founded it for those who
dwell in the wilderness. They set up their towers. They overthrew its
palaces. They made it a ruin. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,14);</script>Howl, you ships of Tarshish, for
your stronghold is laid waste! <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,15);</script>It will come to pass in that day
that Tyre will be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one
king. After the end of seventy years it will be to Tyre like in the song
of the prostitute. <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,16);</script>Take
a harp; go about the city, you prostitute that has been forgotten. Make
sweet melody. Sing many songs, that you may be remembered. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,17);</script>It will happen after the end of
seventy years that Yahweh will visit Tyre, and she shall return to her
wages, and will play the prostitute with all the kingdoms of the world on
the surface of the earth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,18);</script>Her merchandise and her wages
will be holiness to Yahweh. It will not be treasured nor laid up; for her
merchandise will be for those who dwell before Yahweh, to eat
sufficiently, and for durable clothing.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,1);</script>Behold, Yahweh makes
the earth empty, makes it waste, turns it upside down, and scatters its
inhabitants. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,2);</script>It will be
as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his
master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with
the seller; as with the creditor, so with the debtor; as with the taker of
interest, so with the giver of interest. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,3);</script>The earth will be utterly emptied
and utterly laid waste; for Yahweh has spoken this word. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,4);</script>The earth mourns and fades away.
The world languishes and fades away. The lofty people of the earth
languish. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,5);</script>The earth also
is polluted under its inhabitants, because they have transgressed the
laws, violated the statutes, and broken the everlasting covenant. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,6);</script>Therefore the curse has devoured
the earth, and those who dwell therein are found guilty. Therefore the
inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,7);</script>The new wine mourns. The vine
languishes. All the merry-hearted sigh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,8);</script>The mirth of tambourines ceases.
The sound of those who rejoice ends. The joy of the harp ceases. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,9);</script>They will not drink wine with a
song. Strong drink will be bitter to those who drink it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,10);</script>The confused city is broken
down. Every house is shut up, that no man may come in. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,11);</script>There is a crying in the streets
because of the wine. All joy is darkened. The mirth of the land is gone.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(24,12);</script>The city is left in
desolation, and the gate is struck with destruction. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,13);</script>For it will be so in the midst
of the earth among the peoples, as the shaking of an olive tree, as the
gleanings when the vintage is done. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,14);</script>These shall lift up their voice.
They will shout for the majesty of Yahweh. They cry aloud from the sea.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(24,15);</script>Therefore glorify Yahweh
in the east, even the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel, in the islands of
the sea! <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,16);</script>From the
uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs. Glory to the righteous!
But I said, “I pine away! I pine away! woe is me!” The treacherous
have dealt treacherously. Yes, the treacherous have dealt very
treacherously. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,17);</script>Fear, the
pit, and the snare, are on you who inhabitant the earth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,18);</script>It will happen that he who flees
from the noise of the fear will fall into the pit; and he who comes up out
of the midst of the pit will be taken in the snare; for the windows on
high are opened, and the foundations of the earth tremble. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,19);</script>The earth is utterly broken. The
earth is torn apart. The earth is shaken violently. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,20);</script>The earth will stagger like a
drunken man, and will sway back and forth like a hammock. Its disobedience
will be heavy on it, and it will fall and not rise again. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,21);</script>It shall happen in that day that
Yahweh will punish the army of the high ones on high, and the kings of the
earth on the earth. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,22);</script>They
shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and
shall be shut up in the prison; and after many days shall they be visited.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(24,23);</script>Then the moon shall be
confounded, and the sun ashamed; for Yahweh of Armies will reign on Mount
Zion, and in Jerusalem; and before his elders will be glory.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,1);</script>Yahweh, you are my
God. I will exalt you! I will praise your name, for you have done
wonderful things, things planned long ago, in complete faithfulness and
truth. <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,2);</script>For you have made
a city into a heap, a fortified city into a ruin, a palace of strangers to
be no city. It will never be built. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,3);</script>Therefore a strong people will
glorify you. A city of awesome nations will fear you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,4);</script>For you have been a stronghold to
the poor, a stronghold to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the
storm, a shade from the heat, when the blast of the dreaded ones is like a
storm against the wall. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,5);</script>As the heat in a dry place will
you bring down the noise of strangers; as the heat by the shade of a
cloud, the song of the dreaded ones will be brought low. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,6);</script>In this mountain, Yahweh of
Armies will make all peoples a feast of fat things, a feast of choice
wines, of fat things full of marrow, of well refined choice wines. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,7);</script>He will destroy in this mountain
the surface of the covering that covers all peoples, and the veil that is
spread over all nations. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,8);</script>He has swallowed up death
forever! The Lord Yahweh will wipe away tears from off all faces. He will
take the reproach of his people away from off all the earth, for Yahweh
has spoken it. <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,9);</script>It shall
be said in that day, “Behold, this is our God! We have waited for him,
and he will save us! This is Yahweh! We have waited for him. We will be
glad and rejoice in his salvation!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,10);</script>For in this mountain the hand of
Yahweh will rest.
<p>Moab will be trodden down in his place, even like straw is trodden down
in the water of the dunghill. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,11);</script>He will spread out his hands in
its midst, like one who swims spreads out hands to swim, but his pride
will be humbled together with the craft of his hands. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,12);</script>He has brought the high fortress
of your walls down, laid low, and brought to the ground, even to the dust.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,1);</script>In that day, this song
will be sung in the land of Judah:
<p>
<dl>“We have a strong city.
<dd>God appoints salvation for walls and bulwarks.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,2);</script>Open the gates, that
the righteous nation may enter:
<dd>the one which keeps faith.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,3);</script>You will keep
whoever’s mind is steadfast in perfect peace,
<dd>because he trusts in you.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,4);</script>Trust in Yahweh
forever;
<dd>for in Yah, Yahweh, is an everlasting Rock.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,5);</script>For he has brought
down those who dwell on high, the lofty city.
<dd>He lays it low.
<dd>He lays it low even to the ground.
<dd>He brings it even to the dust.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,6);</script>The foot shall tread
it down;
<dd>Even the feet of the poor,
<dd>and the steps of the needy.”
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,7);</script>The way of the just
is uprightness.
<dd>You who are upright make the path of the righteous level.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,8);</script>
</dl>Yes, in the way of your judgments, Yahweh, have we waited for you.
Your name and your renown are the desire of our soul. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,9);</script>With my soul have I desired you
in the night. Yes, with my spirit within me will I seek you earnestly; for
when your judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn
righteousness. <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,10);</script>Let favor
be shown to the wicked, yet he will not learn righteousness. In the land
of uprightness he will deal wrongfully, and will not see Yahweh’s
majesty. <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,11);</script>Yahweh, your
hand is lifted up, yet they don’t see; but they will see your zeal for
the people, and be disappointed. Yes, fire will consume your adversaries.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(26,12);</script>Yahweh, you will ordain
peace for us, for you have also worked all our works for us. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,13);</script>Yahweh our God, other lords
besides you have had dominion over us, but by you only will we make
mention of your name. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,14);</script>The dead shall not live. The
deceased shall not rise. Therefore have you visited and destroyed them,
and caused all memory of them to perish. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,15);</script>You have increased the nation, O
Yahweh. You have increased the nation! You are glorified! You have
enlarged all the borders of the land. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,16);</script>Yahweh, in trouble they have
visited you. They poured out a prayer when your chastening was on them.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(26,17);</script>Like as a woman with
child, who draws near the time of her delivery, is in pain and cries out
in her pangs; so we have been before you, Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,18);</script>We have been with child. We have
been in pain. We gave birth, it seems, only to wind. We have not worked
any deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world
fallen. <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,19);</script>Your dead shall
live. My dead bodies shall arise. Awake and sing, you who dwell in the
dust; for your dew is like the dew of herbs, and the earth will cast forth
the dead.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,20);</script>Come, my people,
enter into your rooms, and shut your doors behind you. Hide yourself for a
little moment, until the indignation is past. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,21);</script>For, behold, Yahweh comes forth
out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their
iniquity. The earth also will disclose her blood, and will no longer cover
her slain.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,1);</script>In that day, Yahweh
with his hard and great and strong sword will punish leviathan, the
fleeing serpent, and leviathan the twisted serpent; and he will kill the
dragon that is in the sea. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,2);</script>In that day, sing to her, “A
pleasant vineyard! <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,3);</script>I,
Yahweh, am its keeper. I will water it every moment. Lest anyone damage
it, I will keep it night and day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,4);</script>Wrath is not in me, but if I
should find briers and thorns, I would do battle! I would march on them
and I would burn them together. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,5);</script>Or else let him take hold of my
strength, that he may make peace with me. Let him make peace with me.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,6);</script>In days to come, Jacob
will take root. Israel will blossom and bud. They will fill the surface of
the world with fruit. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,7);</script>Has
he struck them as he struck those who struck them? Or are they killed like
those who killed them were killed? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,8);</script>In measure, when you send them
away, you contend with them. He has removed them with his rough blast in
the day of the east wind. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,9);</script>Therefore by this the iniquity of
Jacob will be forgiven, and this is all the fruit of taking away his sin:
that he makes all the stones of the altar as chalk stones that are beaten
in pieces, so that the Asherim and the incense altars shall rise no more.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(27,10);</script>For the fortified city
is solitary, a habitation deserted and forsaken, like the wilderness. The
calf will feed there, and there he will lie down, and consume its
branches. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,11);</script>When its
boughs are withered, they will be broken off. The women will come and set
them on fire, for they are a people of no understanding. Therefore he who
made them will not have compassion on them, and he who formed them will
show them no favor. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,12);</script>It
will happen in that day, that Yahweh will thresh from the flowing stream
of the Euphrates to the brook of Egypt; and you will be gathered one by
one, children of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,13);</script>It will happen in that day that
a great trumpet will be blown; and those who were ready to perish in the
land of Assyria, and those who were outcasts in the land of Egypt, shall
come; and they will worship Yahweh in the holy mountain at Jerusalem.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,1);</script>Woe to the crown of
pride of the drunkards of Ephraim, and to the fading flower of his
glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fertile valley of those who
are overcome with wine! <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,2);</script>Behold, the Lord has a mighty and
strong one. Like a storm of hail, a destroying storm, and like a storm of
mighty waters overflowing, he will cast them down to the earth with his
hand. <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,3);</script>The crown of pride
of the drunkards of Ephraim will be trodden under foot. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,4);</script>The fading flower of his glorious
beauty, which is on the head of the fertile valley, shall be like the
first-ripe fig before the summer; which someone picks and eats as soon as
he sees it. <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,5);</script>In that day,
Yahweh of Armies will become a crown of glory, and a diadem of beauty, to
the residue of his people; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,6);</script>and a spirit of justice to him
who sits in judgment, and strength to those who turn back the battle at
the gate. <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,7);</script>They also reel
with wine, and stagger with strong drink. The priest and the prophet reel
with strong drink. They are swallowed up by wine. They stagger with strong
drink. They err in vision. They stumble in judgment. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,8);</script>For all tables are completely
full of filthy vomit and filthiness. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,9);</script>Whom will he teach knowledge? To
whom will he explain the message? Those who are weaned from the milk, and
drawn from the breasts? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,10);</script>For it is precept on precept,
precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little, there a
little. <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,11);</script>But he will
speak to this nation with stammering lips and in another language; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,12);</script>to whom he said, “This is the
resting place. Give rest to weary”; and “This is the refreshing”;
yet they would not hear. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,13);</script>Therefore the word of Yahweh
will be to them precept on precept, precept on precept; line on line, line
on line; here a little, there a little; that they may go, fall backward,
be broken, be snared, and be taken. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,14);</script>Therefore hear the word of
Yahweh, you scoffers, that rule this people in Jerusalem: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,15);</script>“Because you have said, ‘We
have made a covenant with death, and with <a href="#N14">Sheol</a> are we
in agreement. When the overflowing scourge passes through, it won’t come
to us; for we have made lies our refuge, and we have hidden ourselves
under falsehood.’” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,16);</script>Therefore thus says the Lord
Yahweh, “Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone,
a precious cornerstone of a sure foundation. He who believes shall not act
hastily. <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,17);</script>I will make
justice the measuring line, and righteousness the plumb line. The hail
will sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters will overflow the
hiding place. <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,18);</script>Your
covenant with death shall be annulled, and your agreement with <a
href="#N15">Sheol</a> shall not stand. When the overflowing scourge passes
through, then you will be trampled down by it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,19);</script>As often as it passes through,
it will seize you; for morning by morning it will pass through, by day and
by night; and it will be nothing but terror to understand the message.”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(28,20);</script>For the bed is too short
to stretch out on, and the blanket is too narrow to wrap oneself in.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(28,21);</script>For Yahweh will rise up
as on Mount Perazim. He will be angry as in the valley of Gibeon; that he
may do his work, his unusual work, and bring to pass his act, his
extraordinary act. <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,22);</script>Now
therefore don’t be scoffers, lest your bonds be made strong; for I have
heard a decree of destruction from the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, on the
whole earth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,23);</script>Give ear, and hear my
voice! Listen, and hear my speech! <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,24);</script>Does he who plows to sow plow
continually? Does he keep turning the soil and breaking the clods? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,25);</script>When he has leveled its surface,
doesn’t he plant the dill, and scatter the cumin seed, and put in the
wheat in rows, the barley in the appointed place, and the spelt in its
place? <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,26);</script>For his God
instructs him in right judgment, and teaches him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,27);</script>For the dill are not threshed
with a sharp instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned over the cumin;
but the dill is beaten out with a stick, and the cumin with a rod. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,28);</script>Bread flour must be ground; so
he will not always be threshing it. Although he drives the wheel of his
threshing cart over it, his horses don’t grind it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,29);</script>This also comes forth from
Yahweh of Armies, who is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in wisdom.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,1);</script>Woe to Ariel! Ariel,
the city where David encamped! Add year to year; let the feasts come
around; <script type="text/javascript">cb(29,2);</script>then I will
distress Ariel, and there will be mourning and lamentation. She shall be
to me as an <a href="#N16">altar hearth</a>. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,3);</script>I will encamp against you all
around you, and will lay siege against you with posted troops. I will
raise siege works against you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,4);</script>You will be brought down, and
will speak out of the ground. Your speech will mumble out of the dust.
Your voice will be as of one who has a familiar spirit, out of the ground,
and your speech will whisper out of the dust. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,5);</script>But the multitude of your foes
will be like fine dust, and the multitude of the ruthless ones like chaff
that blows away. Yes, it will be in an instant, suddenly. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,6);</script>She will be visited by Yahweh of
Armies with thunder, with earthquake, with great noise, with whirlwind and
storm, and with the flame of a devouring fire. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,7);</script>The multitude of all the nations
that fight against Ariel, even all who fight against her and her
stronghold, and who distress her, will be like a dream, a vision of the
night. <script type="text/javascript">cb(29,8);</script>It will be like
when a hungry man dreams, and behold, he eats; but he awakes, and his
hunger isn’t satisfied; or like when a thirsty man dreams, and behold,
he drinks; but he awakes, and behold, he is faint, and he is still
thirsty. The multitude of all the nations that fight against Mount Zion
will be like that. <script type="text/javascript">cb(29,9);</script>Pause
and wonder! Blind yourselves and be blind! They are drunken, but not with
wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,10);</script>For Yahweh has poured out on you
a spirit of deep sleep, and has closed your eyes, the prophets; and he has
covered your heads, the seers. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,11);</script>All vision has become to you
like the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one who is
educated, saying, “Read this, please”; and he says, “I can’t, for
it is sealed:” <script type="text/javascript">cb(29,12);</script>and the
book is delivered to one who is not educated, saying, “Read this,
please”; and he says, “I can’t read.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,13);</script>The Lord said, “Because this
people draws near with their mouth and with their lips to honor me, but
they have removed their heart far from me, and their fear of me is a
commandment of men which has been taught; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,14);</script>therefore, behold, I will
proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, even a marvelous work
and a wonder; and the wisdom of their wise men will perish, and the
understanding of their prudent men will be hidden.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,15);</script>Woe to those who
deeply hide their counsel from Yahweh, and whose works are in the dark,
and who say, “Who sees us?” and “Who knows us?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,16);</script>You turn things upside down!
Should the potter be thought to be like clay; that the thing made should
say about him who made it, “He didn’t make me”; or the thing formed
say of him who formed it, “He has no understanding?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(29,17);</script>Isn’t it yet a very
little while, and Lebanon will be turned into a fruitful field, and the
fruitful field will be regarded as a forest? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,18);</script>In that day, the deaf will hear
the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind will see out of obscurity
and out of darkness. <script type="text/javascript">cb(29,19);</script>The
humble also will increase their joy in Yahweh, and the poor among men will
rejoice in the Holy One of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,20);</script>For the ruthless is brought to
nothing, and the scoffer ceases, and all those who are alert to do evil
are cut off—<script type="text/javascript">cb(29,21);</script>who cause
a person to be indicted by a word, and lay a snare for the arbiter in the
gate, and who deprive the innocent of justice with false testimony.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(29,22);</script>Therefore thus says
Yahweh, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob: “Jacob
shall no longer be ashamed, neither shall his face grow pale. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(29,23);</script>But when he sees his children,
the work of my hands, in the midst of him, they will sanctify my name.
Yes, they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and will stand in awe of
the God of Israel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(29,24);</script>They
also who err in spirit will come to understanding, and those who grumble
will receive instruction.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,1);</script>“Woe to the
rebellious children,” says Yahweh, “who take counsel, but not from me;
and who make an alliance, but not with my Spirit, that they may add sin to
sin, <script type="text/javascript">cb(30,2);</script>who set out to go
down into Egypt, and have not asked my advice; to strengthen themselves in
the strength of Pharaoh, and to take refuge in the shadow of Egypt!
<script type="text/javascript">cb(30,3);</script>Therefore the strength of
Pharaoh will be your shame, and the refuge in the shadow of Egypt your
confusion. <script type="text/javascript">cb(30,4);</script>For their
princes are at Zoan, and their ambassadors have come to Hanes. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,5);</script>They shall all be ashamed because
of a people that can’t profit them, that are not a help nor profit, but
a shame, and also a reproach.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,6);</script>The burden of the
animals of the South. Through the land of trouble and anguish, of the
lioness and the lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they carry their
riches on the shoulders of young donkeys, and their treasures on the humps
of camels, to an unprofitable people. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,7);</script>For Egypt helps in vain, and to
no purpose; therefore have I called her Rahab who sits still. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,8);</script>Now go, write it before them on a
tablet, and inscribe it in a book, that it may be for the time to come
forever and ever. <script type="text/javascript">cb(30,9);</script>For it
is a rebellious people, lying children, children who will not hear the law
of Yahweh; <script type="text/javascript">cb(30,10);</script>who tell the
seers, “Don’t see!” and to the prophets, “Don’t prophesy to us
right things. Tell us pleasant things. Prophesy deceits. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,11);</script>Get out of the way. Turn aside
from the path. Cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(30,12);</script>Therefore thus says the
Holy One of Israel, “Because you despise this word, and trust in
oppression and perverseness, and rely on it; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,13);</script>therefore this iniquity shall be
to you like a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose
breaking comes suddenly in an instant. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,14);</script>He will break it as a potter’s
vessel is broken, breaking it in pieces without sparing, so that there
won’t be found among the broken piece a piece good enough to take fire
from the hearth, or to dip up water out of the cistern.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,15);</script>For thus said the Lord Yahweh,
the Holy One of Israel, “You will be saved in returning and rest. Your
strength will be in quietness and in confidence.” You refused, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,16);</script>but you said, “No, for we will
flee on horses”; therefore you will flee; and, “We will ride on the
swift”; therefore those who pursue you will be swift. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,17);</script>One thousand will flee at the
threat of one. At the threat of five, you will flee until you are left
like a beacon on the top of a mountain, and like a banner on a hill.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(30,18);</script>Therefore Yahweh will
wait, that he may be gracious to you; and therefore he will be exalted,
that he may have mercy on you, for Yahweh is a God of justice. Blessed are
all those who wait for him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,19);</script>For the people will dwell in
Zion at Jerusalem. You will weep no more. He will surely be gracious to
you at the voice of your cry. When he hears you, he will answer you.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(30,20);</script>Though the Lord may give
you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet your teachers
won’t be hidden anymore, but your eyes will see your teachers; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,21);</script>and when you turn to the right
hand, and when you turn to the left, your ears will hear a voice behind
you, saying, “This is the way. Walk in it.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,22);</script>You shall defile the overlaying
of your engraved images of silver, and the plating of your molten images
of gold. You shall cast them away as an unclean thing. You shall tell it,
“Go away!” <script type="text/javascript">cb(30,23);</script>He will
give the rain for your seed, with which you will sow the ground; and bread
of the increase of the ground will be rich and plentiful. In that day,
your livestock will feed in large pastures. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,24);</script>The oxen likewise and the young
donkeys that till the ground will eat savory provender, which has been
winnowed with the shovel and with the fork. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,25);</script>There shall be brooks and
streams of water on every lofty mountain and on every high hill in the day
of the great slaughter, when the towers fall. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,26);</script>Moreover the light of the moon
will be like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be seven
times brighter, like the light of seven days, in the day that Yahweh binds
up the fracture of his people, and heals the wound they were struck with.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,27);</script>Behold, the name of
Yahweh comes from far away, burning with his anger, and in thick rising
smoke. His lips are full of indignation, and his tongue is as a devouring
fire. <script type="text/javascript">cb(30,28);</script>His breath is as
an overflowing stream that reaches even to the neck, to sift the nations
with the sieve of destruction; and a bridle that leads to ruin will be in
the jaws of the peoples. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,29);</script>You will have a song, as in the
night when a holy feast is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goes
with a flute to come to Yahweh’s mountain, to Israel’s Rock. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,30);</script>Yahweh will cause his glorious
voice to be heard, and will show the descent of his arm, with the
indignation of his anger, and the flame of a devouring fire, with a blast,
storm, and hailstones. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,31);</script>For through the voice of Yahweh
the Assyrian will be dismayed. He will strike him with his rod. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(30,32);</script>Every stroke of the rod of
punishment, which Yahweh will lay on him, will be with the sound of
tambourines and harps. He will fight with them in battles, brandishing
weapons. <script type="text/javascript">cb(30,33);</script>For his burning
place has long been ready. Yes, for the king it is prepared. He has made
its pyre deep and large with fire and much wood. Yahweh’s breath, like a
stream of sulfur, kindles it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,1);</script>
<dl>Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help,
<dd>and rely on horses,
<dd>and trust in chariots because they are many,
<dd>and in horsemen because they are very strong,
<dd>but they don’t look to the Holy One of Israel,
<dd>and they don’t seek Yahweh!
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,2);</script>Yet he also is wise,
and will bring disaster,
<dd>and will not call back his words, but will arise against the house of
the evildoers,
<dd>and against the help of those who work iniquity.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,3);</script>Now the Egyptians are
men, and not God;
<dd>and their horses flesh, and not spirit.
<dt>When Yahweh stretches out his hand, both he who helps shall stumble,
<dd>and he who is helped shall fall,
<dd>and they all shall be consumed together.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,4);</script>For thus says Yahweh
to me,

<dd>if a multitude of shepherds is called together against him,
<dd>will not be dismayed at their voice,
<dd>nor abase himself for their noise,
<dd>so Yahweh of Armies will come down to fight on Mount Zion and on its
heights.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,5);</script>As birds hovering, so
Yahweh of Armies will protect Jerusalem.

<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,6);</script>
</dl>Return to him from whom you have deeply revolted, children of Israel.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(31,7);</script>For in that day everyone

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,8);</script>
<dl>“The Assyrian will fall by the sword, not of man;

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,1);</script>Now it happened in the
fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that Sennacherib king of Assyria
attacked all of the fortified cities of Judah, and captured them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,2);</script>The king of Assyria sent
Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to king Hezekiah with a large army. He
stood by the aqueduct from the upper pool in the fuller’s field highway.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(36,3);</script>Then Eliakim the son of
Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the
son of Asaph, the recorder came out to him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,4);</script>Rabshakeh said to them, “Now
tell Hezekiah, ‘Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria, “What
confidence is this in which you trust? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,5);</script>I say that your counsel and
strength for the war are only vain words. Now in whom do you trust, that
you have rebelled against me? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,6);</script>Behold, you trust in the staff of
this bruised reed, even in Egypt, which if a man leans on it, it will go
into his hand and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust
in him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(36,7);</script>But if you tell
me, ‘We trust in Yahweh our God,’ isn’t that he whose high places
and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and to
Jerusalem, ‘You shall worship before this altar?’” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,8);</script>Now therefore, please make a
pledge to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand
horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,9);</script>How then can you turn away the
face of one captain of the least of my master’s servants, and put your
trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,10);</script>Have I come up now without
Yahweh against this land to destroy it? Yahweh said to me, “Go up
against this land, and destroy it.”’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,11);</script>Then Eliakim, Shebna
and Joah said to Rabshakeh, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic,
for we understand it; and don’t speak to us in the Jews’ language in
the hearing of the people who are on the wall.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,12);</script>But Rabshakeh said,
“Has my master sent me only to your master and to you, to speak these
words, and not to the men who sit on the wall, who will eat their own dung
and drink their own urine with you?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,13);</script>Then Rabshakeh stood, and called
out with a loud voice in the Jews’ language, and said, “Hear the words
of the great king, the king of Assyria! <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,14);</script>Thus says the king, ‘Don’t
let Hezekiah deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,15);</script>Don’t let Hezekiah make you
trust in Yahweh, saying, “Yahweh will surely deliver us. This city
won’t be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.”’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,16);</script>Don’t listen to Hezekiah, for
thus says the king of Assyria, ‘Make your peace with me, and come out to
me; and each of you eat from his vine, and each one from his fig tree, and
each one of you drink the waters of his own cistern; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,17);</script>until I come and take you away
to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of
bread and vineyards. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,18);</script>Beware lest Hezekiah persuade
you, saying, “Yahweh will deliver us.” Have any of the gods of the
nations delivered their lands from the hand of the king of Assyria?
<script type="text/javascript">cb(36,19);</script>Where are the gods of
Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they delivered
Samaria from my hand? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(36,20);</script>Who are they among all the gods
of these countries that have delivered their country out of my hand, that
Yahweh should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,21);</script>But they remained
silent, and said nothing in reply, for the king’s commandment was,
“Don’t answer him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,22);</script>Then Eliakim the son
of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah,
the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn,
and told him the words of Rabshakeh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,1);</script>It happened, when king
Hezekiah heard it, that he tore his clothes, covered himself with
sackcloth, and went into Yahweh’s house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(37,2);</script>He sent Eliakim, who was over the
household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered
with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(37,3);</script>They said to him, “Thus says
Hezekiah, ‘This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of
rejection; for the children have come to the birth, and there is no
strength to bring forth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(37,4);</script>It may be Yahweh your God will
hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent
to defy the living God, and will rebuke the words which Yahweh your God
has heard. Therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is
left.’” <script type="text/javascript">cb(37,5);</script>So the
servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,6);</script>Isaiah said to them,
“Tell your master, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “Don’t be afraid of the
words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria
have blasphemed me. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(37,7);</script>Behold, I will put a spirit in
him and he will hear news, and will return to his own land. I will cause
him to fall by the sword in his own land.”’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,8);</script>So Rabshakeh returned,
and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah, for he had heard
that he was departed from Lachish. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(37,9);</script>He heard news concerning Tirhakah
king of Ethiopia, “He has come out to fight against you.” When he
heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(37,10);</script>“Thus you shall speak to
Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, ‘Don’t let your God in whom you trust
deceive you, saying, “Jerusalem won’t be given into the hand of the
king of Assyria.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(37,11);</script>Behold, you have heard what the
kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly. Shall
you be delivered? <script type="text/javascript">cb(37,12);</script>Have
the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed,
Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the children of Eden who were in Telassar?
<script type="text/javascript">cb(37,13);</script>Where is the king of
Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of
Hena, and Ivvah?’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,14);</script>Hezekiah received the
letter from the hand of the messengers and read it. Then Hezekiah went up
to Yahweh’s house, and spread it before Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(37,15);</script>Hezekiah prayed to Yahweh,
saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(37,16);</script>“Yahweh of
Armies, the God of Israel, who is enthroned among the cherubim, you are
the God, even you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made
heaven and earth. <script type="text/javascript">cb(37,17);</script>Turn
your ear, Yahweh, and hear. Open your eyes, Yahweh, and behold. Hear all
of the words of Sennacherib, who has sent to defy the living God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(37,18);</script>Truly, Yahweh, the kings of
Assyria have destroyed all the countries and their land, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(37,19);</script>and have cast their gods into
the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and
stone; therefore they have destroyed them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(37,20);</script>Now therefore, Yahweh our God,
save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that
you are Yahweh, even you only.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,21);</script>Then Isaiah the son
of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, “Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel,
‘Because you have prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(37,22);</script>this is the word which
Yahweh has spoken concerning him. The virgin daughter of Zion has despised
you and ridiculed you. The daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at
you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(37,23);</script>Whom have you
defied and blasphemed? Against whom have you exalted your voice and lifted
up your eyes on high? Against the Holy One of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(37,24);</script>By your servants, have you
defied the Lord, and have said, “With the multitude of my chariots I
have come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of
Lebanon. I will cut down its tall cedars and its choice fir trees. I will
enter into its farthest height, the forest of its fruitful field. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(37,25);</script>I have dug and drunk water, and
with the sole of my feet I will dry up all the rivers of Egypt.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(37,26);</script>Have you not heard how I have
done it long ago, and formed it in ancient times? Now I have brought it to
pass, that it should be yours to destroy fortified cities, turning them
into ruinous heaps. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(37,27);</script>Therefore their inhabitants had
little power. They were dismayed and confounded. They were like the grass
of the field, and like the green herb, like the grass on the housetops,
and like a field before its crop has grown. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(37,28);</script>But I know your sitting down,
your going out, your coming in, and your raging against me. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(37,29);</script>Because of your raging against
me, and because your arrogance has come up into my ears, therefore will I
put my hook in your nose and my bridle in your lips, and I will turn you
back by the way by which you came. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(37,30);</script>This shall be the sign to you.
You will eat this year that which grows of itself, and in the second year
that which springs from the same; and in the third year sow and reap and
plant vineyards, and eat their fruit. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(37,31);</script>The remnant that is escaped of
the house of Judah will again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(37,32);</script>For out of Jerusalem a
remnant will go forth, and survivors will escape from Mount Zion. The zeal
of Yahweh of Armies will perform this.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(37,33);</script>Therefore thus says Yahweh
concerning the king of Assyria, ‘He will not come to this city, nor
shoot an arrow there, neither will he come before it with shield, nor cast
up a mound against it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(37,34);</script>By the way that he came, by the
same he shall return, and he shall not come to this city,’ says Yahweh.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(37,35);</script>‘For I will defend
this city to save it, for my own sake, and for my servant David’s
sake.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(37,36);</script>The angel of Yahweh
went out and struck one hundred and eighty-five thousand men in the camp
of the Assyrians. When men arose early in the morning, behold, these were
all dead bodies. <script type="text/javascript">cb(37,37);</script>So
Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, went away, returned to Nineveh, and
stayed there. <script type="text/javascript">cb(37,38);</script>It
happened, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that
Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons struck him with the sword; and they
escaped into the land of Ararat. Esar Haddon his son reigned in his place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,1);</script>In those days was
Hezekiah sick and near death. Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, came to
him, and said to him, “Thus says Yahweh, ‘Set your house in order, for
you will die, and not live.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,2);</script>Then Hezekiah turned
his face to the wall and prayed to Yahweh, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(38,3);</script>and said, “Remember now,
Yahweh, I beg you, how I have walked before you in truth and with a
perfect heart, and have done that which is good in your sight.” Hezekiah
wept bitterly.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,4);</script>Then the word of
Yahweh came to Isaiah, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(38,5);</script>“Go, and tell Hezekiah, ‘Thus
says Yahweh, the God of David your father, “I have heard your prayer. I
have seen your tears. Behold, I will add fifteen years to your life.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(38,6);</script>I will deliver you and
this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend this
city. <script type="text/javascript">cb(38,7);</script>This shall be the
sign to you from Yahweh, that Yahweh will do this thing that he has
spoken. <script type="text/javascript">cb(38,8);</script>Behold, I will
cause the shadow on the sundial, which has gone down on the sundial of
Ahaz with the sun, to return backward ten steps. So the sun returned ten

Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and had recovered of his
sickness.

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(38,21);</script>Now Isaiah had said,
“Let them take a cake of figs, and lay it for a poultice on the boil,

is the sign that I will go up to the house of Yahweh?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(39,1);</script>At that time, Merodach
Baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to
Hezekiah; for he heard that he had been sick, and had recovered. <script

and showed them the house of his precious things, the silver, and the
gold, the spices, and the precious oil, and all the house of his armor,
and all that was found in his treasures. There was nothing in his house,
nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah didn’t show them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(39,3);</script>Then Isaiah the prophet came to
king Hezekiah, and asked him, “What did these men say? Where did they
come from to you?”

Babylon.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(39,4);</script>Then he asked, “What
have they seen in your house?”
<p>Hezekiah answered, “They have seen all that is in my house. There is
nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(39,5);</script>Then Isaiah said to
Hezekiah, “Hear the word of Yahweh of Armies: <script

</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(45,1);</script>Thus says Yahweh to

to a father, ‘What have you become the father of?’

<dt>They will go after you.
<dd>They shall come over in chains;

<dt>They will make supplication to you:
<dd>‘Surely God is in you; and there is none else.
<dd>There is no other god.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(45,15);</script>Most certainly you

<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(45,16);</script>They will be
disappointed,

<dd>You will not be disappointed nor confounded to ages everlasting.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(45,18);</script>For thus says Yahweh
who created the heavens,

<dt>“I am Yahweh;

<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(45,19);</script>I have not spoken in
secret,

it.
<dd>Yes, let them take counsel together.
<dt>Who has shown this from ancient time?

<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(45,22);</script>“Look to me, and

<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(45,23);</script>I have sworn by
myself, the word has gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and will not
return, that to me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall take an oath.

‘There is righteousness and strength only in Yahweh.’”
<dt>Even to him shall men come; and all those who were incensed against
him shall be disappointed. <script

Israel be justified, and shall glory.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(46,1);</script>Bel bows down, Nebo
stoops; their idols are on the animals, and on the livestock: the things
that you carried about are made a load, a burden to the weary. <script

together; they could not deliver the burden, but themselves have gone into
captivity.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(46,3);</script>“Listen to me,

borne from their birth, that have been carried from the womb; <script

and weigh silver in the balance. They hire a goldsmith, and he makes it a
god. They fall down—yes, they worship. <script

they carry it, and set it in its place, and it stands, from its place it

old: for I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none

<script type="text/javascript">cb(46,12);</script>Listen to me, you
stout-hearted, who are far from righteousness: <script

it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not wait; and I will place
salvation in Zion for Israel my glory.

<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(47,6);</script>I was angry with my
people, I profaned my inheritance, and gave them into your hand: you
showed them no mercy; on the aged you have very heavily laid your yoke.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(47,7);</script>You said, ‘I shall be a
mistress forever;’ so that you did not lay these things to your heart,
nor did you remember the latter end of it.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(47,8);</script>“Now therefore hear
this, you who are given to pleasures, who sit securely, who say in your
heart, ‘I am, and there is none else besides me; I shall not sit as a
widow, neither shall I know the loss of children:’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(47,9);</script>but these two things shall come
to you in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood; in
their full measure shall they come on you, in the multitude of your
sorceries, and the great abundance of your enchantments. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(47,10);</script>For you have trusted in your
wickedness; you have said, No one sees me; your wisdom and your knowledge,
it has perverted you, and you have said in your heart, I am, and there is
none else besides me. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(47,11);</script>Therefore evil will come on you;
you won’t know when it dawns: and mischief will fall on you; you will
not be able to put it away: and desolation shall come on you suddenly,
which you don’t know.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(47,12);</script>“Stand now with
your enchantments, and with the multitude of your sorceries, in which you
have labored from your youth; if so be you shall be able to profit, if so
be you may prevail. <script type="text/javascript">cb(47,13);</script>You
are wearied in the multitude of your counsels: let now the astrologers,
the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save you from
the things that shall come on you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(47,14);</script>Behold, they shall be as
stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from
the power of the flame: it shall not be a coal to warm at, nor a fire to
sit before. <script type="text/javascript">cb(47,15);</script>Thus shall
the things be to you in which you have labored: those who have trafficked
with you from your youth shall wander everyone to his quarter; there shall
be none to save you.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(48,1);</script>“Hear this, house

<script type="text/javascript">cb(48,2);</script>(for they call themselves

Armies is his name): <script type="text/javascript">cb(48,3);</script>I
have declared the former things from of old; yes, they went forth out of
my mouth, and I showed them: suddenly I did them, and they happened.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(48,4);</script>Because I knew that you
are obstinate, and your neck is an iron sinew, and your brow brass;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(48,5);</script>therefore I have declared
it to you from of old; before it came to pass I showed it to you; lest you
should say, ‘My idol has done them, and my engraved image, and my molten
image, has commanded them.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(48,6);</script>You have heard it; see all this;

<dt>“I have shown you new things from this time, even hidden things,

say, ‘Behold, I knew them.’
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(48,8);</script>Yes, you didn’t
hear; yes, you didn’t know; yes, from of old your ear was not opened:
for I knew that you dealt very treacherously, and was called a
transgressor from the womb. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(48,9);</script>For my name’s sake will I defer
my anger, and for my praise will I refrain for you, that I not cut you
off. <script type="text/javascript">cb(48,10);</script>Behold, I have
refined you, but not as silver; I have chosen you in the furnace of
affliction. <script type="text/javascript">cb(48,11);</script>For my own

<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(48,12);</script>“Listen to me, O

yourselves, all you, and hear; who among them has declared these things?
He whom Yahweh loves shall perform his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm
shall be on the Chaldeans. <script

it was, there am I.” Now the Lord Yahweh has sent me, with his Spirit.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(48,17);</script>Thus says Yahweh,
your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: I am Yahweh your God, who teaches
you to profit, who leads you by the way that you should go. <script

commandments! then your peace would have been like a river, and your
righteousness like the waves of the sea: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(48,19);</script>your seed also had been as the
sand, and the offspring of your body like its grains: his name would not
be cut off nor destroyed from before me. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(48,20);</script>Go forth from Babylon, flee from
the Chaldeans; with a voice of singing declare, tell this, utter it even
to the end of the earth: say, Yahweh has redeemed his servant Jacob.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(48,21);</script>They didn’t thirst
when he led them through the deserts; he caused the waters to flow out of
the rock for them; he split the rock also, and the waters gushed out.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(48,22);</script>“There is no peace,”
says Yahweh, “for the wicked.”
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(49,1);</script>Listen, islands, to
me; and listen, you peoples, from far: Yahweh has called me from the womb;
from the bowels of my mother has he made mention of my name: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(49,2);</script>and he has made my mouth like a
sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand, he has hidden me: and he has made
me a polished shaft; in his quiver has he kept me close: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(49,3);</script>and he said to me, “You are my
servant; Israel, in whom I will be glorified.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(49,4);</script>But I said, “I have labored in
vain, I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity; yet surely the
justice due to me is with Yahweh, and my reward with my God.”
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(49,5);</script>Now says Yahweh who
formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob again to him,
and that Israel be gathered to him (for I am honorable in the eyes of
Yahweh, and my God has become my strength); <script
type="text/javascript">cb(49,6);</script>yes, he says, “It is too light
a thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and
to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give you for a light to
the nations, that you may be my salvation to the end of the earth.”
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(49,7);</script>Thus says Yahweh, the
Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One, to him whom man despises, to him
whom the nation abhors, to a servant of rulers: “Kings shall see and
arise; princes, and they shall worship; because of Yahweh who is faithful,
even the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.”
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(49,8);</script>Thus says Yahweh,
“In an acceptable time have I answered you, and in a day of salvation
have I helped you; and I will preserve you, and give you for a covenant of
the people, to raise up the land, to make them inherit the desolate
heritage: <script type="text/javascript">cb(49,9);</script>saying to those
who are bound, ‘Come out!’; to those who are in darkness, ‘Show
yourselves!’
<dt>
<dt>“They shall feed in the ways, and on all bare heights shall be their
pasture. <script type="text/javascript">cb(49,10);</script>They shall not
hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun strike them: for he who
has mercy on them will lead them, even by springs of water he will guide
them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(49,11);</script>I will make all my
mountains a way, and my highways shall be exalted. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(49,12);</script>Behold, these shall come from
far; and behold, these from the north and from the west; and these from
the land of Sinim.”
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(49,13);</script>Sing, heavens; and
be joyful, earth; and break forth into singing, mountains: for Yahweh has
comforted his people, and will have compassion on his afflicted. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(49,14);</script>But Zion said, “Yahweh has
forsaken me, and the Lord has forgotten me.”
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(49,15);</script>“Can a woman
forget her nursing child, that she should not have compassion on the son

the palms of my hands; your walls are continually before me. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(49,17);</script>Your children make haste; your
destroyers and those who made you waste shall go forth from you. <script

live,” says Yahweh, “you shall surely clothe yourself with them all as

<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(49,19);</script>“For, as for your
waste and your desolate places, and your land that has been destroyed,
surely now you shall be too small for the inhabitants, and those who
swallowed you up shall be far away. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(49,20);</script>The children of your bereavement
shall yet say in your ears, The place is too small for me; give place to
me that I may dwell. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(49,21);</script>Then you will say in your heart,
‘Who has conceived these for me, since I have been bereaved of my
children, and am solitary, an exile, and wandering back and forth? Who has
brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where were they?’”
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(49,22);</script>Thus says the Lord
Yahweh, “Behold, I will lift up my hand to the nations, and set up my
banner to the peoples; and they shall bring your sons in their bosom, and
your daughters shall be carried on their shoulders. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(49,23);</script>Kings shall be your nursing
fathers, and their queens your nursing mothers: they shall bow down to you
with their faces to the earth, and lick the dust of your feet; and you
shall know that I am Yahweh; and those who wait for me shall not be
disappointed.”
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(49,24);</script>Shall the prey be
taken from the mighty, or the lawful captives be delivered?
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(49,25);</script>But thus says
Yahweh, “Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the
prey of the terrible shall be delivered; for I will contend with him who
contends with you, and I will save your children. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(49,26);</script>I will feed those who oppress
you with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood,
as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I, Yahweh, am your
Savior, and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.”
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(50,1);</script>Thus says Yahweh,
“Where is the bill of your mother’s divorce, with which I have put her
away? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you? Behold, for
your iniquities were you sold, and for your transgressions was your mother
put away. <script type="text/javascript">cb(50,2);</script>Why, when I
came, was there no man? when I called, was there none to answer? Is my
hand shortened at all, that it can’t redeem? or have I no power to
deliver? Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a
wilderness: their fish stink, because there is no water, and die for
thirst. <script type="text/javascript">cb(50,3);</script>I clothe the
heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.”
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(50,4);</script>The Lord Yahweh has
given me the tongue of those who are taught, that I may know how to
sustain with words him who is weary: he wakens morning by morning, he
wakens my ear to hear as those who are taught. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(50,5);</script>The Lord Yahweh has opened my
ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away backward. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(50,6);</script>I gave my back to the strikers,
and my cheeks to those who plucked off the hair; I didn’t hide my face
from shame and spitting. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(50,7);</script>For the Lord Yahweh will help me;
therefore I have not been confounded: therefore have I set my face like a
flint, and I know that I shall not be disappointed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(50,8);</script>He is near who justifies me; who
will bring charges against me? Let us stand up together: who is my
adversary? Let him come near to me. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(50,9);</script>Behold, the Lord Yahweh will help
me; who is he who shall condemn me? Behold, all they shall wax old as a
garment, the moth shall eat them up. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(50,10);</script>Who is among you who fears
Yahweh, who obeys the voice of his servant? He who walks in darkness, and
has no light, let him trust in the name of Yahweh, and rely on his God.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(50,11);</script>Behold, all you who
kindle a fire, who adorn yourselves with torches around yourselves; walk
in the flame of your fire, and among the brands that you have kindled. You
shall have this of my hand; you shall lie down in sorrow.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(51,1);</script>“Listen to me, you
who follow after righteousness, you who seek Yahweh: look to the rock you
were cut from, and to the hold of the pit you were dug from. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(51,2);</script>Look to Abraham your father, and
to Sarah who bore you; for when he was but one I called him, and I blessed
him, and made him many. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(51,3);</script>For Yahweh has comforted Zion; he
has comforted all her waste places, and has made her wilderness like Eden,
and her desert like the garden of Yahweh; joy and gladness shall be found
therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(51,4);</script>“Attend to me, my
people; and give ear to me, my nation: for a law shall go forth from me,
and I will establish my justice for a light of the peoples. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(51,5);</script>My righteousness is near, my
salvation is gone forth, and my arms shall judge the peoples; the islands
shall wait for me, and on my arm shall they trust. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(51,6);</script>Lift up your eyes to the heavens,
and look on the earth beneath; for the heavens shall vanish away like
smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment; and those who dwell
therein shall die in the same way: but my salvation shall be forever, and
my righteousness shall not be abolished.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(51,7);</script>“Listen to me, you
who know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; don’t fear
the reproach of men, neither be dismayed at their insults. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(51,8);</script>For the moth shall eat them up
like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool; but my
righteousness shall be forever, and my salvation to all generations.”
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(51,9);</script>Awake, awake, put on
strength, arm of Yahweh; awake, as in the days of old, the generations of
ancient times. Isn’t it you who cut Rahab in pieces, who pierced the
monster? <script type="text/javascript">cb(51,10);</script>Isn’t it you
who dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep; who made the depths of
the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(51,11);</script>The ransomed of Yahweh shall
return, and come with singing to Zion; and everlasting joy shall be on
their heads. They shall obtain gladness and joy. Sorrow and sighing shall
flee away.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(51,12);</script>“I, even I, am he
who comforts you: who are you, that you are afraid of man who shall die,
and of the son of man who shall be made as grass; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(51,13);</script>and have forgotten Yahweh your
Maker, who stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the
earth; and fear continually all the day because of the fury of the
oppressor, when he makes ready to destroy? and where is the fury of the
oppressor? <script type="text/javascript">cb(51,14);</script>The captive
exile shall speedily be freed; and he shall not die and go down into the
pit, neither shall his bread fail. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(51,15);</script>For I am Yahweh your God, who
stirs up the sea, so that its waves roar: Yahweh of Armies is his name.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(51,16);</script>I have put my words in
your mouth, and have covered you in the shadow of my hand, that I may
plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and tell Zion,
‘You are my people.’”
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(51,17);</script>Awake, awake, stand
up, Jerusalem, that have drunk at the hand of Yahweh the cup of his wrath;
you have drunken the bowl of the cup of staggering, and drained it.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(51,18);</script>There is none to guide
her among all the sons whom she has brought forth; neither is there any
who takes her by the hand among all the sons who she has brought up.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(51,19);</script>These two things have
happened to you. Who will bemoan you? Desolation and destruction, and the
famine and the sword; how shall I comfort you? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(51,20);</script>Your sons have fainted, they lie
at the head of all the streets, as an antelope in a net; they are full of
the wrath of Yahweh, the rebuke of your God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(51,21);</script>Therefore hear now this, you
afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(51,22);</script>Thus says your Lord Yahweh, and
your God who pleads the cause of his people, “Behold, I have taken out
of your hand the cup of staggering, even the bowl of the cup of my wrath;
you shall no more drink it again: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(51,23);</script>and I will put it into the hand
of those who afflict you, who have said to your soul, ‘Bow down, that we
may walk over you;’ and you have laid your back as the ground, and as
the street, to those who walk over.”
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(52,1);</script>Awake, awake, put on
your strength, Zion; put on your beautiful garments, Jerusalem, the holy
city: for henceforth there shall no more come into you the uncircumcised
and the unclean. <script type="text/javascript">cb(52,2);</script>Shake
yourself from the dust! Arise, sit up, Jerusalem! Release yourself from
the bonds of your neck, captive daughter of Zion! <script
type="text/javascript">cb(52,3);</script>For thus says Yahweh, “You were
sold for nothing; and you shall be redeemed without money.”
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(52,4);</script>For thus says the
Lord Yahweh, “My people went down at the first into Egypt to live there:
and the Assyrian has oppressed them without cause.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(52,5);</script>“Now therefore,
what do I do here,” says Yahweh, “seeing that my people are taken away
for nothing? Those who rule over them mock,” says Yahweh, “and my name
continually all the day is blasphemed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(52,6);</script>Therefore my people shall know my
name. Therefore they shall know in that day that I am he who speaks;
behold, it is I.”
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(52,7);</script>How beautiful on the
mountains are the feet of him who brings good news, who publishes peace,
who brings good news of good, who publishes salvation, who says to Zion,
“Your God reigns!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(52,8);</script>The voice of your watchmen! they
lift up the voice, together do they sing; for they shall see eye to eye,
when Yahweh returns to Zion. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(52,9);</script>Break forth into joy, sing
together, you waste places of Jerusalem; for Yahweh has comforted his
people, he has redeemed Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(52,10);</script>Yahweh has made bare his holy
arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth have
seen the salvation of our God.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(52,11);</script>Depart, depart, go
out from there, touch no unclean thing! Go out of the midst of her!
Cleanse yourselves, you who bear the vessels of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(52,12);</script>For you shall not go out in
haste, neither shall you go by flight: for Yahweh will go before you; and
the God of Israel will be your rear guard.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(52,13);</script>Behold, my servant
shall deal wisely, he shall be exalted and lifted up, and shall be very
high.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(52,14);</script>Like as many were
astonished at you (his appearance was marred more than any man, and his
form more than the sons of men),
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(52,15);</script>so shall he sprinkle
many nations; kings shall shut their mouths at him: for that which had not
been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall
they understand.
<dt>
<dt> <script type="text/javascript">cb(53,1);</script>Who has believed our
message?
<dd>To whom has the arm of Yahweh been revealed?
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(53,2);</script>For he grew up before
him as a tender plant,
<dd>and as a root out of dry ground.
<dt>He has no good looks or majesty.
<dd>When we see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(53,3);</script>He was despised,
<dd>and rejected by men;
<dt>a man of suffering,
<dd>and acquainted with disease.
<dt>He was despised as one from whom men hide their face;
<dd>and we didn’t respect him.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(53,4);</script>Surely he has borne
our sickness,
<dd>and carried our suffering;
<dt>yet we considered him plagued,
<dd>struck by God, and afflicted.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(53,5);</script>But he was pierced
for our transgressions.
<dd>He was crushed for our iniquities.
<dt>The punishment that brought our peace was on him;
<dd>and by his wounds we are healed.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(53,6);</script>All we like sheep
have gone astray.
<dd>Everyone has turned to his own way;
<dd>and Yahweh has laid on him the iniquity of us all.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(53,7);</script>He was oppressed,
<dd>yet when he was afflicted he didn’t open his mouth.
<dt>As a lamb that is led to the slaughter,
<dd>and as a sheep that before its shearers is mute,
<dd>so he didn’t open his mouth.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(53,8);</script>He was taken away by
oppression and judgment;
<dd>and as for his generation,
<dd>who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living
<dd>and stricken for the disobedience of my people?
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(53,9);</script>They made his grave
with the wicked,
<dd>and with a rich man in his death;
<dt>although he had done no violence,
<dd>neither was any deceit in his mouth.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(53,10);</script>Yet it pleased
Yahweh to bruise him.
<dd>He has caused him to suffer.
<dt>When you make his soul an offering for sin,
<dd>he shall see his seed.
<dt>He shall prolong his days,
<dd>and the pleasure of Yahweh shall prosper in his hand.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(53,11);</script>After the suffering
of his soul,
<dd>he will see the <a href="#N21">light</a> and be satisfied.
<dt>My righteous servant will justify many by the knowledge of himself;
<dd>and he will bear their iniquities.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(53,12);</script>Therefore will I
divide him a portion with the great,
<dd>and he shall divide the spoil with the strong;
<dt>because he poured out his soul to death,
<dd>and was numbered with the transgressors;
<dt>yet he bore the sin of many,
<dd>and made intercession for the transgressors.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(54,1);</script>“Sing, barren, you
who didn’t bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, you who did
not travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate than the
children of the married wife,” says Yahweh.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(54,2);</script>“Enlarge the place
of your tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of your habitations;
don’t spare: lengthen your cords, and strengthen your stakes. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(54,3);</script>For you shall spread out on the
right hand and on the left; and your seed shall possess the nations, and
make the desolate cities to be inhabited.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(54,4);</script>“Don’t be afraid;
for you shall not be ashamed: neither be confounded; for you shall not be
disappointed: for you shall forget the shame of your youth; and the
reproach of your widowhood you shall remember no more. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(54,5);</script>For your Maker is your husband;
Yahweh of Armies is his name: and the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer;
the God of the whole earth shall he be called. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(54,6);</script>For Yahweh has called you as a
wife forsaken and grieved in spirit, even a wife of youth, when she is
cast off,” says your God.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(54,7);</script>“For a small moment
have I forsaken you; but with great mercies will I gather you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(54,8);</script>In overflowing wrath I hid my
face from you for a moment; but with everlasting loving kindness will I
have mercy on you,” says Yahweh your Redeemer.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(54,9);</script>“For this is like
the waters of Noah to me; for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah
shall no more go over the earth, so have I sworn that I will not be angry
with you, nor rebuke you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(54,10);</script>For the mountains may depart,
and the hills be removed; but my loving kindness shall not depart from
you, neither shall my covenant of peace be removed,” says Yahweh who has
mercy on you.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(54,11);</script>“You afflicted,
tossed with storms, and not comforted, behold, I will set your stones in
beautiful colors, and lay your foundations with sapphires. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(54,12);</script>I will make your pinnacles of
rubies, and your gates of sparkling jewels, and all your walls of precious
stones. <script type="text/javascript">cb(54,13);</script>All your
children shall be taught of Yahweh; and great shall be the peace of your
children. <script type="text/javascript">cb(54,14);</script>In
righteousness you shall be established: you shall be far from oppression,
for you shall not be afraid; and from terror, for it shall not come near
you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(54,15);</script>Behold, they may
gather together, but not by me: whoever shall gather together against you
shall fall because of you.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(54,16);</script>“Behold, I have
created the smith who blows the fire of coals, and brings forth a weapon
for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(54,17);</script>No weapon that is
formed against you will prevail;
<dd>and you will condemn every tongue that rises against you in judgment.
<dt>This is the heritage of the servants of Yahweh,
<dd>and their righteousness which is of me,” says Yahweh.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(55,1);</script>“Come, everyone who
thirsts, to the waters! Come, he who has no money, buy, and eat! Yes,
come, buy wine and milk without money and without price. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(55,2);</script>Why do you spend money for that
which is not bread? and your labor for that which doesn’t satisfy?
listen diligently to me, and eat you that which is good, and let your soul
delight itself in fatness. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(55,3);</script>Turn your ear, and come to me;
hear, and your soul shall live: and I will make an everlasting covenant
with you, even the sure mercies of David. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(55,4);</script>Behold, I have given him for a
witness to the peoples, a leader and commander to the peoples. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(55,5);</script>Behold, you shall call a nation
that you don’t know; and a nation that didn’t know you shall run to
you, because of Yahweh your God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he
has glorified you.”
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(55,6);</script>Seek Yahweh while he
may be found; call you on him while he is near: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(55,7);</script>let the wicked forsake his way,
and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return to Yahweh, and he
will have mercy on him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(55,8);</script>“For my thoughts
are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,” says Yahweh.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(55,9);</script>“For as the heavens
are higher than the earth,
<dd>so are my ways higher than your ways,
<dd>and my thoughts than your thoughts.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(55,10);</script>For as the rain
comes down and the snow from the sky,
<dd>and doesn’t return there, but waters the earth,
<dd>and makes it bring forth and bud,
<dd>and gives seed to the sower and bread to the eater;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(55,11);</script>so shall my word be
that goes forth out of my mouth:
<dd>it shall not return to me void,
<dd>but it shall accomplish that which I please,
<dd>and it shall prosper in the thing I sent it to do.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(55,12);</script>For you shall go out
with joy,
<dd>and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break
forth before you into singing; and all the trees of the fields shall clap
their hands. <script type="text/javascript">cb(55,13);</script>Instead of
the thorn shall come up the fir tree; and instead of the brier shall come
up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to Yahweh for a name, for an
everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.”
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(56,1);</script>Thus says Yahweh,
“Keep justice, and do righteousness; for my salvation is near to come,
and my righteousness to be revealed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(56,2);</script>Blessed is the man who does this,
and the son of man who holds it fast; who keeps the Sabbath from profaning
it, and keeps his hand from doing any evil.”
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(56,3);</script>Neither let the
foreigner, who has joined himself to Yahweh, speak, saying, “Yahweh will
surely separate me from his people”; neither let the eunuch say,
“Behold, I am a dry tree.”
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(56,4);</script>For thus says Yahweh,
“To the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths, and choose the things that please
me, and hold fast my covenant: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(56,5);</script>to them I will give in my house
and within my walls a memorial and a name better than of sons and of
daughters; I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut
off. <script type="text/javascript">cb(56,6);</script>Also the foreigners
who join themselves to Yahweh, to minister to him, and to love the name of
Yahweh, to be his servants, everyone who keeps the Sabbath from profaning
it, and holds fast my covenant; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(56,7);</script>even them will I bring to my holy
mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt
offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted on my altar; for my house
shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples.”
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(56,8);</script>The Lord Yahweh, who
gathers the outcasts of Israel, says, “Yet will I gather others to him,
besides his own who are gathered.”
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(56,9);</script>All you animals of
the field, come to devour, all you animals in the forest. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(56,10);</script>His watchmen are blind, they are
all without knowledge; they are all mute dogs, they can’t bark;
dreaming, lying down, loving to slumber. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(56,11);</script>Yes, the dogs are greedy, they
can never have enough; and these are shepherds who can’t understand:
they have all turned to their own way, each one to his gain, from every
quarter. <script type="text/javascript">cb(56,12);</script>“Come,” say
they, “I will get wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink;
and tomorrow shall be as this day, great beyond measure.”
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(57,1);</script>The righteous
perishes, and no man lays it to heart; and merciful men are taken away,
none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(57,2);</script>He enters into peace; they rest
in their beds, each one who walks in his uprightness.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(57,3);</script>“But draw near
here, you sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the
prostitute. <script type="text/javascript">cb(57,4);</script>Against whom

out your tongue? Aren’t you children of disobedience, a seed of
falsehood, <script type="text/javascript">cb(57,5);</script>you who
inflame yourselves among the oaks, under every green tree; who kill the
children in the valleys, under the clefts of the rocks? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(57,6);</script>Among the smooth stones of the
valley is your portion; they, they are your lot; you have even poured a
drink offering to them. You have offered an offering. Shall I be appeased
for these things? <script type="text/javascript">cb(57,7);</script>On a
high and lofty mountain you have set your bed; there also you went up to
offer sacrifice. <script type="text/javascript">cb(57,8);</script>Behind
the doors and the posts you have set up your memorial:
<dd>for you have uncovered to someone besides me,
<dd>and have gone up;

<dd>and made you a covenant with them:
<dd>you loved their bed where you saw it.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(57,9);</script>You went to the king
with oil, and increased your perfumes, and sent your ambassadors far off,
and debased yourself even to <a href="#N22">Sheol</a>. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(57,10);</script>You were wearied with the length
of your way; yet you didn’t say, ‘It is in vain.’ You found a
reviving of your strength; therefore you weren’t faint.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(57,11);</script>“Of whom have you
been afraid and in fear, that you lie, and have not remembered me, nor
laid it to your heart? Haven’t I held my peace even of long time, and
you don’t fear me? <script type="text/javascript">cb(57,12);</script>I
will declare your righteousness; and as for your works, they shall not
profit you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(57,13);</script>When you
cry, let those who you have gathered deliver you; but the wind shall take
them, a breath shall carry them all away: but he who takes refuge in me
shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain.”
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(57,14);</script>He will say, “Cast
up, cast up, prepare the way,
<dd>take up the stumbling-block out of the way of my people.”
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(57,15);</script>For thus says the
high and lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy:
<dd>“I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also who is of a
contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to
revive the heart of the contrite.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(57,16);</script>For I will not
contend forever, neither will I be always angry; for the spirit would
faint before me, and the souls who I have made. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(57,17);</script>For the iniquity of his
covetousness was I angry, and struck him; I hid myself and was angry; and
he went on backsliding in the way of his heart. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(57,18);</script>I have seen his ways, and will
heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts to him and to his
mourners. <script type="text/javascript">cb(57,19);</script>I create the
fruit of the lips: Peace, peace, to him who is far off and to him who is
near,” says Yahweh; “and I will heal them.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(57,20);</script>But the wicked are like the
troubled sea; for it can’t rest, and its waters cast up mire and dirt.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(57,21);</script>“There is no peace,”
says my God, “for the wicked.”
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(58,1);</script>“Cry aloud, don’t
spare, lift up your voice like a trumpet, and declare to my people their
disobedience, and to the house of Jacob their sins. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(58,2);</script>Yet they seek me daily, and
delight to know my ways: as a nation that did righteousness, and didn’t
forsake the ordinance of their God, they ask of me righteous judgments;
they delight to draw near to God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(58,3);</script>‘Why have we fasted,’ say
they, ‘and you don’t see? Why have we afflicted our soul, and you take
no knowledge?’
<dt>
<dt>“Behold, in the day of your fast you find pleasure, and exact all
your labors. <script type="text/javascript">cb(58,4);</script>Behold, you
fast for strife and contention, and to strike with the fist of wickedness:
you don’t fast this day so as to make your voice to be heard on high.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(58,5);</script>Is such the fast that I
have chosen? the day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his
head as a rush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? Will you call
this a fast, and an acceptable day to Yahweh?
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(58,6);</script>“Isn’t this the
fast that I have chosen: to release the bonds of wickedness, to undo the
bands of the yoke, and to let the oppressed go free, and that you break
every yoke? <script type="text/javascript">cb(58,7);</script>Isn’t it to
distribute your bread to the hungry, and that you bring the poor who are
cast out to your house? When you see the naked, that you cover him; and
that you not hide yourself from your own flesh? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(58,8);</script>Then your light shall break forth
as the morning, and your healing shall spring forth speedily; and your
righteousness shall go before you; the glory of Yahweh shall be your rear
guard.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(58,9);</script>Then you shall call,
and Yahweh will answer; you shall cry, and he will say, ‘Here I am.’
<dt>
<dt>“If you take away from the midst of you the yoke, the putting forth
of the finger, and speaking wickedly; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(58,10);</script>and if you draw out your soul to
the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul: then your light shall rise in
darkness, and your obscurity be as the noonday; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(58,11);</script>and Yahweh will guide you
continually, and satisfy your soul in dry places, and make strong your
bones; and you shall be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water,
whose waters don’t fail. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(58,12);</script>Those who shall be of you shall
build the old waste places; you shall raise up the foundations of many
generations; and you shall be called The repairer of the breach, The
restorer of paths to dwell in.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(58,13);</script>“If you turn away
your foot from the Sabbath, from doing your pleasure on my holy day; and
call the Sabbath a delight, and the holy of Yahweh honorable; and shall
honor it, not doing your own ways, nor finding your own pleasure, nor
speaking your own words: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(58,14);</script>then you shall delight yourself
in Yahweh; and I will make you to ride on the high places of the earth;
and I will feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father:”
<dd>for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(59,1);</script>Behold, Yahweh’s
hand is not shortened, that it can’t save; neither his ear heavy, that
it can’t hear: <script type="text/javascript">cb(59,2);</script>but your
iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have
hidden his face from you, so that he will not hear. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(59,3);</script>For your hands are defiled with
blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your
tongue mutters wickedness. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(59,4);</script>None sues in righteousness, and
none pleads in truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive
mischief, and bring forth iniquity. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(59,5);</script>They hatch adders’ eggs, and
weave the spider’s web: he who eats of their eggs dies; and that which
is crushed breaks out into a viper. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(59,6);</script>Their webs shall not become
garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their
works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(59,7);</script>Their feet run to evil,
and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of
iniquity; desolation and destruction are in their paths. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(59,8);</script>The way of peace they don’t
know; and there is no justice in their goings: they have made them crooked
paths; whoever goes therein does not know peace. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(59,9);</script>Therefore is justice far from us,
neither does righteousness overtake us: we look for light, but, behold,
darkness; for brightness, but we walk in obscurity. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(59,10);</script>We grope for the wall like the
blind; yes, we grope as those who have no eyes: we stumble at noonday as
in the twilight; among those who are lusty we are as dead men. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(59,11);</script>We roar all like bears, and moan
bitterly like doves: we look for justice, but there is none; for
salvation, but it is far off from us.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(59,12);</script>For our
transgressions are multiplied before you, and our sins testify against us;
for our transgressions are with us, and as for our iniquities, we know
them: <script type="text/javascript">cb(59,13);</script>transgressing and
denying Yahweh, and turning away from following our God, speaking
oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of
falsehood. <script type="text/javascript">cb(59,14);</script>Justice is
turned away backward, and righteousness stands afar off; for truth is
fallen in the street, and uprightness can’t enter. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(59,15);</script>Yes, truth is lacking; and he
who departs from evil makes himself a prey. Yahweh saw it, and it
displeased him that there was no justice. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(59,16);</script>He saw that there was no man,
and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his own arm brought
salvation to him; and his righteousness, it upheld him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(59,17);</script>He put on righteousness as a
breastplate, and a helmet of salvation on his head; and he put on garments
of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a mantle. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(59,18);</script>According to their deeds,
accordingly he will repay, wrath to his adversaries, recompense to his
enemies; to the islands he will repay recompense. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(59,19);</script>So shall they fear the name of
Yahweh from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun; for he
will come as a rushing stream, which the breath of Yahweh drives.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(59,20);</script>“A Redeemer will
come to Zion,
<dd>and to those who turn from disobedience in Jacob,” says Yahweh.
<dt>
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(59,21);</script>“As for me, this is
my covenant with them,” says Yahweh. “My Spirit who is on you, and my
words which I have put in your mouth, shall not depart out of your mouth,
nor out of the mouth of your seed, nor out of the mouth of your seed’s
seed,” says Yahweh, “from henceforth and forever.”
<p>
<dl>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(60,1);</script>“Arise, shine; for
your light has come, and the glory of Yahweh is risen on you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(60,2);</script>For, behold, darkness shall cover
the earth, and gross darkness the peoples; but Yahweh will arise on you,
and his glory shall be seen on you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(60,3);</script>Nations shall come to your light,
and kings to the brightness of your rising.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(60,4);</script>“Lift up your eyes
all around, and see: they all gather themselves together, they come to
you; your sons shall come from far, and your daughters shall be carried in
the arms. <script type="text/javascript">cb(60,5);</script>Then you shall
see and be radiant, and your heart shall thrill and be enlarged; because
the abundance of the sea shall be turned to you, the wealth of the nations
shall come to you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(60,6);</script>The
multitude of camels shall cover you, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah;
all they from Sheba shall come; they shall bring gold and frankincense,
and shall proclaim the praises of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(60,7);</script>All the flocks of Kedar shall be
gathered together to you, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister to you; they
shall come up with acceptance on my altar; and I will glorify the house of
my glory.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(60,8);</script>“Who are these who
fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(60,9);</script>Surely the islands shall wait for
me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring your sons from far, their
silver and their gold with them, for the name of Yahweh your God, and for
the Holy One of Israel, because he has glorified you.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(60,10);</script>“Foreigners shall
build up your walls, and their kings shall minister to you: for in my
wrath I struck you, but in my favor have I had mercy on you.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(60,11);</script>Your gates also
shall be open continually; they shall not be shut day nor night; that men
may bring to you the wealth of the nations, and their kings led captive.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(60,12);</script>For that nation and
kingdom that will not serve you shall perish; yes, those nations shall be
utterly wasted.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(60,13);</script>“The glory of
Lebanon shall come to you, the fir tree, the pine, and the box tree
together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary; and I will make the place
of my feet glorious.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(60,14);</script>The sons of those
who afflicted you shall come bending to you; and all those who despised
you shall bow themselves down at the soles of your feet; and they shall
call you The city of Yahweh, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(60,15);</script>“Whereas you have
been forsaken and hated, so that no man passed through you, I will make
you an eternal excellency, a joy of many generations. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(60,16);</script>You shall also drink the milk of
the nations, and shall nurse from royal breasts; and you shall know that
I, Yahweh, am your Savior, and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(60,17);</script>For brass I will bring
gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones
iron. I will also make your officers peace, and righteousness your ruler.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(60,18);</script>Violence shall no more
be heard in your land, desolation nor destruction within your borders; but
you shall call your walls Salvation, and your gates Praise. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(60,19);</script>The sun shall be no more your
light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light to you: but
Yahweh will be to you an everlasting light, and your God your glory.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(60,20);</script>Your sun shall no more
go down, neither shall your moon withdraw itself; for Yahweh will be your
everlasting light, and the days of your mourning shall be ended. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(60,21);</script>Your people also shall be all
righteous; they shall inherit the land forever, the branch of my planting,
the work of my hands, that I may be glorified. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(60,22);</script>The little one shall become a
thousand, and the small one a strong nation; I, Yahweh, will hasten it in
its time.”
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(61,1);</script>The Spirit of the
Lord Yahweh is on me;
<dd>because Yahweh has anointed me to preach good news to the humble.
<dt>He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted,
<dd>to proclaim liberty to the captives,
<dd>and release to those who are bound;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(61,2);</script>to proclaim the year
of Yahweh’s favor, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all
who mourn; <script type="text/javascript">cb(61,3);</script>to appoint to
those who mourn in Zion, to give to them a garland for ashes, the oil of
joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that
they may be called trees of righteousness, the planting of Yahweh, that he
may be glorified.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(61,4);</script>They shall build the
old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall
repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(61,5);</script>Strangers shall stand and feed
your flocks, and foreigners shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(61,6);</script>But you shall be named
the priests of Yahweh; men will call you the ministers of our God: you
will eat the wealth of the nations, and you will boast in their glory.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(61,7);</script>Instead of your shame
you shall have double; and instead of dishonor they shall rejoice in their
portion: therefore in their land they shall possess double; everlasting
joy shall be to them.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(61,8);</script>“For I, Yahweh,
love justice, I hate robbery with iniquity; and I will give them their
recompense in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(61,9);</script>Their seed shall be known
among the nations, and their offspring among the peoples; all who see them
shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed which Yahweh has blessed.”
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(61,10);</script>I will greatly
rejoice in Yahweh, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he has clothed
me with the garments of salvation, he has covered me with the robe of
righteousness, as a bridegroom decks himself with a garland, and as a
bride adorns herself with her jewels. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(61,11);</script>For as the earth brings forth
its bud, and as the garden causes the things that are sown in it to spring
forth; so the Lord Yahweh will cause righteousness and praise to spring
forth before all the nations.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(62,1);</script>For Zion’s sake
will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem’s sake I will not rest,
until her righteousness go forth as brightness, and her salvation as a
lamp that burns. <script type="text/javascript">cb(62,2);</script>The
nations shall see your righteousness, and all kings your glory, and you
shall be called by a new name, which the mouth of Yahweh shall name.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(62,3);</script>You shall also be a crown
of beauty in the hand of Yahweh, and a royal diadem in the hand of your
God. <script type="text/javascript">cb(62,4);</script>You shall no more be
termed Forsaken; neither shall your land any more be termed Desolate: but
you shall be called Hephzibah, and your land Beulah; for Yahweh delights
in you, and your land shall be married. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(62,5);</script>For as a young man marries a
virgin, so your sons shall marry you; and as the bridegroom rejoices over
the bride, so your God will rejoice over you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(62,6);</script>I have set watchmen on your
walls, Jerusalem; they shall never hold their peace day nor night: you who
call on Yahweh, take no rest, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(62,7);</script>and give him no rest, until he
establishes, and until he makes Jerusalem a praise in the earth.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(62,8);</script>Yahweh has sworn by
his right hand, and by the arm of his strength,
<dd>“Surely I will no more give your grain to be food for your enemies;
and foreigners shall not drink your new wine, for which you have labored:
<script type="text/javascript">cb(62,9);</script>but those who have
garnered it shall eat it, and praise Yahweh; and those who have gathered
it shall drink it in the courts of my sanctuary.”
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(62,10);</script>Go through, go
through the gates! Prepare the way of the people! Cast up, cast up the
highway! Gather out the stones! Lift up a banner for the peoples. <script

the end of the earth,

<dt>Behold, his reward is with him,
<dd>and his recompense before him.’”
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(62,12);</script>They shall call them
The holy people, The redeemed of Yahweh: and you shall be called Sought
out, A city not forsaken.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(63,1);</script>Who is this who comes
from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this who is glorious in his
clothing, marching in the greatness of his strength?
<dd>“It is I who speak in righteousness, mighty to save.”
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(63,2);</script>Why are you red in
your clothing, and your garments like him who treads in the wine vat?
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(63,3);</script>“I have trodden the
winepress alone; and of the peoples there was no man with me: yes, I trod
them in my anger, and trampled them in my wrath; and their lifeblood is
sprinkled on my garments, and I have stained all my clothing. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(63,4);</script>For the day of vengeance was in
my heart, and the year of my redeemed has come. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(63,5);</script>I looked, and there was none to
help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore my own arm
brought salvation to me; and my wrath, it upheld me. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(63,6);</script>I trod down the peoples in my
anger, and made them drunk in my wrath, and I poured out their lifeblood
on the earth.”
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(63,7);</script>I will make mention
of the loving kindnesses of Yahweh and the praises of Yahweh, according to
all that Yahweh has bestowed on us, and the great goodness toward the
house of Israel, which he has bestowed on them according to his mercies,
and according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(63,8);</script>For he said, “Surely, they are
my people, children who will not deal falsely:” so he was their Savior.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(63,9);</script>In all their
affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in
his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bore them, and carried
them all the days of old. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(63,10);</script>But they rebelled, and grieved
his holy Spirit: therefore he was turned to be their enemy, and he himself
fought against them.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(63,11);</script>Then he remembered
the days of old, Moses and his people, saying, Where is he who brought
them up out of the sea with the shepherds of his flock? where is he who
put his holy Spirit in their midst? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(63,12);</script>who caused his glorious arm to
go at the right hand of Moses? who divided the waters before them, to make
himself an everlasting name? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(63,13);</script>who led them through the depths,
as a horse in the wilderness, so that they didn’t stumble? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(63,14);</script>As the livestock that go down
into the valley, the Spirit of Yahweh caused them to rest; so you led your
people, to make yourself a glorious name.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(63,15);</script>Look down from
heaven, and see from the habitation of your holiness and of your glory:
where are your zeal and your mighty acts? the yearning of your heart and
your compassion is restrained toward me. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(63,16);</script>For you are our Father, though
Abraham doesn’t know us, and Israel does not acknowledge us: you,
Yahweh, are our Father; our Redeemer from everlasting is your name.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(63,17);</script>O Yahweh, why do you
make us to err from your ways, and harden our heart from your fear? Return
for your servants’ sake, the tribes of your inheritance. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(63,18);</script>Your holy people possessed it
but a little while: our adversaries have trodden down your sanctuary.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(63,19);</script>We have become as they
over whom you never bear rule, as those who were not called by your name.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(64,1);</script>Oh that you would
tear the heavens, that you would come down, that the mountains might quake
at your presence, <script type="text/javascript">cb(64,2);</script>as when
fire kindles the brushwood, and the fire causes the waters to boil; to
make your name known to your adversaries, that the nations may tremble at
your presence! <script type="text/javascript">cb(64,3);</script>When you
did awesome things which we didn’t look for, you came down, the
mountains quaked at your presence. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(64,4);</script>For from of old men have not
heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither has the eye seen a God besides
you, who works for him who waits for him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(64,5);</script>You meet him who rejoices and
works righteousness, those who remember you in your ways. Behold, you were
angry, and we sinned. We have been in sin for a long time; and shall we be
saved? <script type="text/javascript">cb(64,6);</script>For we have all
become as one who is unclean, and all our righteousness is as a polluted
garment: and we all fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind,
take us away. <script type="text/javascript">cb(64,7);</script>There is
none who calls on your name, who stirs up himself to take hold of you; for
you have hidden your face from us, and have consumed us by means of our
iniquities.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(64,8);</script>But now, Yahweh, you
are our Father; we are the clay, and you our potter; and we all are the
work of your hand. <script

neither remember iniquity forever: see, look, we beg you, we are all your
people. <script type="text/javascript">cb(64,10);</script>Your holy cities
are become a wilderness, Zion has become a wilderness, Jerusalem a
desolation. <script type="text/javascript">cb(64,11);</script>Our holy and
our beautiful house, where our fathers praised you, is burned with fire;
and all our pleasant places are laid waste. <script

these things, Yahweh? Will you hold your peace, and afflict us very
severely?

the day to a rebellious people, who walk in a way that is not good, after
their own thoughts; <script type="text/javascript">cb(65,3);</script>a
people who provoke me to my face continually, sacrificing in gardens, and
burning incense on bricks; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(65,4);</script>who sit among the graves, and
lodge in the secret places; who eat pig’s flesh, and broth of abominable
things is in their vessels; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(65,5);</script>who say, Stand by yourself,
don’t come near to me, for I am holier than you. These are a smoke in my
nose, a fire that burns all the day.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(65,6);</script>“Behold, it is
written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, yes, I
will recompense into their bosom, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(65,7);</script>your own iniquities, and the
iniquities of your fathers together,” says Yahweh, “who have burned
incense on the mountains, and blasphemed me on the hills; therefore will I
first measure their work into their bosom.”
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(65,8);</script>Thus says Yahweh,
<dt>“As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one says, ‘Don’t
destroy it, for a blessing is in it:’ so will I do for my servants’
sake, that I may not destroy them all. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(65,9);</script>I will bring forth a seed out of
Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains; and my chosen shall
inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(65,10);</script>Sharon shall be a fold of
flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in, for my
people who have sought me.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(65,11);</script>“But you who
forsake Yahweh, who forget my holy mountain, who prepare a table for
Fortune, and who fill up mixed wine to Destiny; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(65,12);</script>I will destine you to the sword,
and you shall all bow down to the slaughter; because when I called, you
didn’t answer; when I spoke, you didn’t listen; but you did that which
was evil in my eyes, and chose that in which I didn’t delight.”
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(65,13);</script>Therefore thus says
the Lord Yahweh, “Behold, my servants shall eat, but you shall be
hungry; behold, my servants shall drink, but you shall be thirsty; behold,
my servants shall rejoice, but you shall be disappointed; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(65,14);</script>behold, my servants shall sing
for joy of heart, but you shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall wail
for anguish of spirit.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(65,15);</script>You shall leave your
name for a curse to my chosen; and the Lord Yahweh will kill you; and he
will call his servants by another name: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(65,16);</script>so that he who blesses himself
in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he who swears in
the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are
forgotten, and because they are hidden from my eyes.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(65,17);</script>“For, behold, I
create new heavens and a new earth; and the former things shall not be
remembered, nor come into mind. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(65,18);</script>But be you glad and rejoice
forever in that which I create; for, behold, I create Jerusalem a
rejoicing, and her people a joy. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(65,19);</script>I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and
joy in my people; and there shall be heard in her no more the voice of
weeping and the voice of crying.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(65,20);</script>“There shall be no
more there an infant of days, nor an old man who has not filled his days;
for the child shall die one hundred years old, and the sinner being one
hundred years old shall be accursed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(65,21);</script>They shall build houses, and
inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat their fruit. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(65,22);</script>They shall not build, and
another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of
a tree shall be the days of my people, and my chosen shall long enjoy the
work of their hands. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(65,23);</script>They shall not labor in vain,
nor bring forth for calamity; for they are the seed of the blessed of
Yahweh, and their offspring with them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(65,24);</script>It shall happen that, before
they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(65,25);</script>The wolf and the lamb
shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox; and dust
shall be the serpent’s food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my
holy mountain,” says Yahweh.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(66,1);</script>Thus says Yahweh,
“Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: what kind of house
will you build to me? and what place shall be my rest? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(66,2);</script>For all these things has my hand
made, and so all these things came to be,” says Yahweh:
<dt>“but to this man will I look, even to him who is poor and of a
contrite spirit, and who trembles at my word.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(66,3);</script>He who kills an ox is
as he who kills a man; he who sacrifices a lamb, as he who breaks a
dog’s neck; he who offers an offering, as he who offers pig’s blood;
he who burns frankincense, as he who blesses an idol. Yes, they have
chosen their own ways, and their soul delights in their abominations:
<script type="text/javascript">cb(66,4);</script>I also will choose their
delusions, and will bring their fears on them; because when I called, no
one answered; when I spoke, they didn’t listen; but they did that which
was evil in my eyes, and chose that in which I didn’t delight.”
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(66,5);</script>Hear the word of
Yahweh, you who tremble at his word: “Your brothers who hate you, who
cast you out for my name’s sake, have said,
<dd>‘Let Yahweh be glorified, that we may see your joy;’ but it is
those who shall be disappointed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(66,6);</script>A voice of tumult from the city,
a voice from the temple, a voice of Yahweh that renders recompense to his
enemies.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(66,7);</script>“Before she
travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she delivered a son.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(66,8);</script>Who has heard such a
thing? who has seen such things? Shall a land be born in one day? shall a
nation be brought forth at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she
brought forth her children. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(66,9);</script>Shall I bring to the birth, and
not cause to bring forth?” says Yahweh: “shall I who cause to bring
forth shut the womb?” says your God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(66,10);</script>“Rejoice with Jerusalem, and
be glad for her, all you who love her: rejoice for joy with her, all you
who mourn over her;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(66,11);</script>that you may nurse
and be satisfied at the comforting breasts; that you may drink deeply, and
be delighted with the abundance of her glory.”
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(66,12);</script>For thus says
Yahweh, “Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory
of the nations like an overflowing stream: and you will nurse. You will be
carried on her side, and will be dandled on her knees.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(66,13);</script>As one whom his
mother comforts, so will I comfort you; and you will be comforted in
Jerusalem.”
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(66,14);</script>You will see it, and
your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like the tender
grass: and the hand of Yahweh shall be known toward his servants; and he
will have indignation against his enemies. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(66,15);</script>For, behold, Yahweh will come
with fire, and his chariots shall be like the whirlwind; to render his
anger with fierceness, and his rebuke with flames of fire. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(66,16);</script>For by fire will Yahweh execute
judgment, and by his sword, on all flesh; and the slain of Yahweh shall be
many.
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(66,17);</script>“Those who sanctify
themselves and purify themselves to go to the gardens, behind one in the
midst, eating pig’s flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, they
shall come to an end together,” says Yahweh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(66,18);</script>“For I know their
works and their thoughts: the time comes, that I will gather all nations
and languages; and they shall come, and shall see my glory.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(66,19);</script>“I will set a sign
among them, and I will send such as escape of them to the nations, to
Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, who draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the
islands afar off, who have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory;
and they shall declare my glory among the nations. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(66,20);</script>They shall bring all your
brothers out of all the nations for an offering to Yahweh, on horses, and
in chariots, and in litters, and on mules, and on dromedaries, to my holy
mountain Jerusalem, says Yahweh, as the children of Israel bring their
offering in a clean vessel into the house of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(66,21);</script>Of them also will I take for
priests and for Levites,” says Yahweh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(66,22);</script>“For as the new
heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me,”
says Yahweh, “so your seed and your name shall remain. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(66,23);</script>It shall happen, that from one
new moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, shall all flesh come
to worship before me,” says Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(66,24);</script>“They shall go forth, and look
on the dead bodies of the men who have transgressed against me: for their
worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they will be
loathsome to all mankind.”
