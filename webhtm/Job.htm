Job
</h1><p>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,1);</script>There was a man in the
land of Uz, whose name was Job. That man was blameless and upright, and
one who feared <a href="#N1">God</a>, and turned away from evil. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,2);</script>There were born to him seven sons
and three daughters. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,3);</script>His
possessions also were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five
hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very great
household; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the
east. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,4);</script>His sons went and
held a feast in the house of each one on his birthday; and they sent and
called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,5);</script>It was so, when the days of their
feasting had run their course, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose
up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the
number of them all. For Job said, “It may be that my sons have sinned,
and renounced God in their hearts.” Job did so continually.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,6);</script>Now it happened on the
day when God’s sons came to present themselves before <a
href="#N2">Yahweh,</a> that Satan also came among them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,7);</script>Yahweh said to Satan, “Where
have you come from?”
<p>Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “From going back and forth in
the earth, and from walking up and down in it.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,8);</script>Yahweh said to Satan,
“Have you considered my servant, Job? For there is none like him in the
earth, a blameless and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away
from evil.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,9);</script>Then Satan answered
Yahweh, and said, “Does Job fear God for nothing? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,10);</script>Haven’t you made a hedge around
him, and around his house, and around all that he has, on every side? You
have blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the
land. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,11);</script>But put forth your
hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will renounce you to your
face.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,12);</script>Yahweh said to Satan,
“Behold, all that he has is in your power. Only on himself don’t put
forth your hand.”
<p>So Satan went forth from the presence of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,13);</script>It fell on a day when his sons
and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest
brother’s house, <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,14);</script>that
there came a messenger to Job, and said, “The oxen were plowing, and the
donkeys feeding beside them, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,15);</script>and the Sabeans attacked, and
took them away. Yes, they have killed the servants with the edge of the
sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,16);</script>While he was still
speaking, there also came another, and said, “The fire of God has fallen
from the sky, and has burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed
them, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,17);</script>While he was still
speaking, there came also another, and said, “The Chaldeans made three
bands, and swept down on the camels, and have taken them away, yes, and
killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped
to tell you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,18);</script>While he was still
speaking, there came also another, and said, “Your sons and your
daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,19);</script>and behold, there came a
great wind from the wilderness, and struck the four corners of the house,
and it fell on the young men, and they are dead. I alone have escaped to
tell you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,20);</script>Then Job arose, and
tore his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down on the ground, and
worshiped. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,21);</script>He said,
“Naked I came out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return there.
Yahweh gave, and Yahweh has taken away. Blessed be the name of Yahweh.”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,22);</script>In all this, Job did not
sin, nor charge God with wrongdoing.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,1);</script>Again it happened on
the day when the God’s sons came to present themselves before Yahweh,
that Satan came also among them to present himself before Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,2);</script>Yahweh said to Satan, “Where
have you come from?”
<p>Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “From going back and forth in the
earth, and from walking up and down in it.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,3);</script>Yahweh said to Satan,
“Have you considered my servant Job? For there is none like him in the
earth, a blameless and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away
from evil. He still maintains his integrity, although you incited me
against him, to ruin him without cause.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,4);</script>Satan answered Yahweh,
and said, “Skin for skin. Yes, all that a man has he will give for his
life. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,5);</script>But put forth your
hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce you to
your face.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,6);</script>Yahweh said to Satan,
“Behold, he is in your hand. Only spare his life.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,7);</script>So Satan went forth
from the presence of Yahweh, and struck Job with painful sores from the
sole of his foot to his head. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,8);</script>He took for himself a potsherd to
scrape himself with, and he sat among the ashes. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,9);</script>Then his wife said to him, “Do
you still maintain your integrity? Renounce God, and die.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,10);</script>But he said to her,
“You speak as one of the foolish women would speak. What? Shall we
receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?”
<p>In all this Job didn’t sin with his lips. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,11);</script>Now when Job’s three friends
heard of all this evil that had come on him, they each came from his own
place: Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the
Naamathite, and they made an appointment together to come to sympathize
with him and to comfort him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,12);</script>When they lifted up their eyes
from a distance, and didn’t recognize him, they raised their voices, and
wept; and they each tore his robe, and sprinkled dust on their heads
toward the sky. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,13);</script>So they
sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and none
spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief was very great.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,1);</script>After this Job opened
his mouth, and cursed the day of his birth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,2);</script>Job answered: 
<dl>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,3);</script>“Let the day perish
in which I was born,
<dd>the night which said, ‘There is a boy conceived.’
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,4);</script>Let that day be
darkness.
<dd>Don’t let God from above seek for it,
<dd>neither let the light shine on it.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,5);</script>Let darkness and the
shadow of death claim it for their own.
<dd>Let a cloud dwell on it.
<dd>Let all that makes black the day terrify it.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,6);</script>As for that night, let
thick darkness seize on it.
<dd>Let it not rejoice among the days of the year.
<dd>Let it not come into the number of the months.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,7);</script>Behold, let that night
be barren.
<dd>Let no joyful voice come therein.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,8);</script>Let them curse it who
curse the day,
<dd>who are ready to rouse up leviathan.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,9);</script>Let the stars of its
twilight be dark.
<dd>Let it look for light, but have none,
<dd>neither let it see the eyelids of the morning,
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,10);</script>because it didn’t
shut up the doors of my mother’s womb,
<dd>nor did it hide trouble from my eyes.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,11);</script>“Why didn’t I die
from the womb?
<dd>Why didn’t I give up the spirit when my mother bore me?
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,12);</script>Why did the knees
receive me?
<dd>Or why the breast, that I should nurse?
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,13);</script>For now should I have
lain down and been quiet.
<dd>I should have slept, then I would have been at rest,
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,14);</script>with kings and
counselors of the earth,
<dd>who built up waste places for themselves;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,15);</script>or with princes who
had gold,
<dd>who filled their houses with silver:
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,16);</script>or as a hidden
untimely birth I had not been,
<dd>as infants who never saw light.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,17);</script>There the wicked
cease from troubling.
<dd>There the weary are at rest.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,18);</script>There the prisoners
are at ease together.
<dd>They don’t hear the voice of the taskmaster.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,19);</script>The small and the
great are there.
<dd>The servant is free from his master.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,20);</script>“Why is light given
to him who is in misery,
<dd>life to the bitter in soul,
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,21);</script>Who long for death,
but it doesn’t come;
<dd>and dig for it more than for hidden treasures,
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,22);</script>who rejoice
exceedingly,
<dd>and are glad, when they can find the grave?
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,23);</script>Why is light given to
a man whose way is hidden,
<dd>whom God has hedged in?
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,24);</script>For my sighing comes
before I eat.
<dd>My groanings are poured out like water.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,25);</script>For the thing which I
fear comes on me,
<dd>That which I am afraid of comes to me.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,26);</script>I am not at ease,
neither am I quiet, neither have I rest;
<dd>but trouble comes.”
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,1);</script>Then Eliphaz the
Temanite answered, 
<dl>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,2);</script>“If someone ventures
to talk with you, will you be grieved?
<dd>But who can withhold himself from speaking?
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,3);</script>Behold, you have
instructed many,
<dd>you have strengthened the weak hands.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,4);</script>Your words have
supported him who was falling,
<dd>You have made firm the feeble knees.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,5);</script>But now it has come to
you, and you faint.
<dd>It touches you, and you are troubled.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,6);</script>Isn’t your piety
your confidence?
<dd>Isn’t the integrity of your ways your hope?
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,7);</script>“Remember, now,
whoever perished, being innocent?
<dd>Or where were the upright cut off?
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,8);</script>According to what I
have seen, those who plow iniquity,
<dd>and sow trouble,
<dd>reap the same.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,9);</script>By the breath of God
they perish.
<dd>By the blast of his anger are they consumed.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,10);</script>The roaring of the
lion,
<dd>and the voice of the fierce lion,
<dd>the teeth of the young lions, are broken.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,11);</script>The old lion perishes
for lack of prey.
<dd>The cubs of the lioness are scattered abroad.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,12);</script>“Now a thing was
secretly brought to me.
<dd>My ear received a whisper of it.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,13);</script>In thoughts from the
visions of the night,
<dd>when deep sleep falls on men,
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,14);</script>fear came on me, and
trembling,
<dd>which made all my bones shake.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,15);</script>Then a spirit passed
before my face.
<dd>The hair of my flesh stood up.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,16);</script>It stood still, but I
couldn’t discern its appearance.
<dd>A form was before my eyes.
<dd>Silence, then I heard a voice, saying,
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,17);</script>‘Shall mortal man
be more just than God?
<dd>Shall a man be more pure than his Maker?
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,18);</script>Behold, he puts no
trust in his servants.
<dd>He charges his angels with error.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,19);</script>How much more, those
who dwell in houses of clay,
<dd>whose foundation is in the dust,
<dd>who are crushed before the moth!
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,20);</script>Between morning and
evening they are destroyed.
<dd>They perish forever without any regarding it.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,21);</script>Isn’t their tent
cord plucked up within them?
<dd>They die, and that without wisdom.’
<dt>
<dt>
</dl>
<dl><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,1);</script>“Call now; is there
any who will answer you?
<dd>To which of the holy ones will you turn?
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,2);</script>For resentment kills
the foolish man,
<dd>and jealousy kills the simple.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,3);</script>I have seen the
foolish taking root,
<dd>but suddenly I cursed his habitation.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,4);</script>His children are far
from safety.
<dd>They are crushed in the gate.
<dd>Neither is there any to deliver them,
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,5);</script>whose harvest the
hungry eats up,
<dd>and take it even out of the thorns.
<dd>The snare gapes for their substance.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,6);</script>For affliction
doesn’t come forth from the dust,
<dd>neither does trouble spring out of the ground;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,7);</script>but man is born to
trouble,
<dd>as the sparks fly upward.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,8);</script>“But as for me, I
would seek God.
<dd>I would commit my cause to God,
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,9);</script>who does great things
that can’t be fathomed,
<dd>marvelous things without number;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,10);</script>who gives rain on the
earth,
<dd>and sends waters on the fields;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,11);</script>so that he sets up on
high those who are low,
<dd>those who mourn are exalted to safety.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,12);</script>He frustrates the
devices of the crafty,
<dd>So that their hands can’t perform their enterprise.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,13);</script>He takes the wise in
their own craftiness;
<dd>the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,14);</script>They meet with
darkness in the day time,
<dd>and grope at noonday as in the night.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,15);</script>But he saves from the
sword of their mouth,
<dd>even the needy from the hand of the mighty.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,16);</script>So the poor has hope,
<dd>and injustice shuts her mouth.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,17);</script>“Behold, happy is
the man whom God corrects.
<dd>Therefore do not despise the chastening of the Almighty.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,18);</script>For he wounds, and
binds up.
<dd>He injures, and his hands make whole.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,19);</script>He will deliver you
in six troubles;
<dd>yes, in seven no evil shall touch you.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,20);</script>In famine he will
redeem you from death;
<dd>in war, from the power of the sword.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,21);</script>You shall be hidden
from the scourge of the tongue,
<dd>neither shall you be afraid of destruction when it comes.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,22);</script>At destruction and
famine you shall laugh,
<dd>neither shall you be afraid of the animals of the earth.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,23);</script>For you shall be
allied with the stones of the field.
<dd>The animals of the field shall be at peace with you.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,24);</script>You shall know that
your tent is in peace.
<dd>You shall visit your fold, and shall miss nothing.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,25);</script>You shall know also
that your seed shall be great,
<dd>Your offspring as the grass of the earth.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,26);</script>You shall come to
your grave in a full age,
<dd>like a shock of grain comes in its season.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,27);</script>Look this, we have
searched it, so it is.
<dd>Hear it, and know it for your good.”
</dl>
<p>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,1);</script>Then Job answered, 
<dl>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,2);</script>“Oh that my anguish
were weighed,
<dd>and all my calamity laid in the balances!
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,3);</script>For now it would be
heavier than the sand of the seas,
<dd>therefore have my words been rash.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,4);</script>For the arrows of the
Almighty are within me.
<dd>My spirit drinks up their poison.
<dt>The terrors of God set themselves in array against me.
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,5);</script>Does the wild donkey
bray when he has grass?
<dt>Or does the ox low over his fodder?
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,6);</script>Can that which has no
flavor be eaten without salt?
<dt>Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,7);</script>My soul refuses to
touch them.
<dt>They are as loathsome food to me.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,8);</script>“Oh that I might
have my request,
<dd>that God would grant the thing that I long for,
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,9);</script>even that it would
please God to crush me;
<dd>that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,10);</script>Be it still my
consolation,
<dd>yes, let me exult in pain that doesn’t spare,
<dd>that I have not denied the words of the Holy One.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,11);</script>What is my strength,
that I should wait?
<dd>What is my end, that I should be patient?
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,12);</script>Is my strength the
strength of stones?
<dd>Or is my flesh of brass?
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,13);</script>Isn’t it that I
have no help in me,
<dd>That wisdom is driven quite from me?
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,14);</script>“To him who is
ready to faint, kindness should be shown from his friend;
<dd>even to him who forsakes the fear of the Almighty.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,15);</script>My brothers have
dealt deceitfully as a brook,
<dd>as the channel of brooks that pass away;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,16);</script>Which are black by
reason of the ice,
<dd>in which the snow hides itself.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,17);</script>In the dry season,
they vanish.
<dd>When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,18);</script>The caravans that
travel beside them turn aside.
<dd>They go up into the waste, and perish.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,19);</script>The caravans of Tema
looked.
<dd>The companies of Sheba waited for them.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,20);</script>They were distressed
because they were confident.
<dd>They came there, and were confounded.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,21);</script>For now you are
nothing.
<dd>You see a terror, and are afraid.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,22);</script>Did I say, ‘Give to
me?’
<dd>or, ‘Offer a present for me from your substance?’
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,23);</script>or, ‘Deliver me
from the adversary’s hand?’
<dd>or, ‘Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors?’
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,24);</script>“Teach me, and I
will hold my peace.
<dd>Cause me to understand wherein I have erred.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,25);</script>How forcible are
words of uprightness!
<dd>But your reproof, what does it reprove?
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,26);</script>Do you intend to
reprove words,
<dd>since the speeches of one who is desperate are as wind?
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,27);</script>Yes, you would even
cast lots for the fatherless,
<dd>and make merchandise of your friend.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,28);</script>Now therefore be
pleased to look at me,

<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,29);</script>Please return.
<dd>Let there be no injustice.
<dd>Yes, return again.
<dd>My cause is righteous.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,30);</script>Is there injustice on
my tongue?

<dt>
<dt>
</dl>
<dl><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,1);</script>“Isn’t a man
forced to labor on earth?

earnestly desires the shadow,

<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,2);</script>See now, I have
opened my mouth.
<dd>My tongue has spoken in my mouth.

<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,4);</script>The Spirit of God has
made me,

<dd>Set your words in order before me, and stand forth.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,6);</script>Behold, I am toward
God even as you are.
<dd>I am also formed out of the clay.

<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,8);</script>“Surely you have
spoken in my hearing,

without disobedience.
<dd>I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me.

occasions against me.
<dd>He counts me for his enemy.

the stocks.
<dd>He marks all my paths.’
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,12);</script>“Behold, I will
answer you. In this you are not just,
<dd>for God is greater than man.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,13);</script>Why do you strive
against him,
<dd>because he doesn’t give account of any of his matters?
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,14);</script>For God speaks once,
<dd>yes twice, though man pays no attention.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,15);</script>In a dream, in a
vision of the night,
<dd>when deep sleep falls on men,
<dd>in slumbering on the bed;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,16);</script>Then he opens the
ears of men,
<dd>and seals their instruction,
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,17);</script>That he may withdraw
man from his purpose,
<dd>and hide pride from man.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,18);</script>He keeps back his
soul from the pit,
<dd>and his life from perishing by the sword.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,19);</script>He is chastened also
with pain on his bed,
<dd>with continual strife in his bones;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,20);</script>So that his life
abhors bread,
<dd>and his soul dainty food.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,21);</script>His flesh is so
consumed away, that it can’t be seen.
<dd>His bones that were not seen stick out.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,22);</script>Yes, his soul draws
near to the pit,
<dd>and his life to the destroyers.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,23);</script>“If there is
beside him an angel,
<dd>an interpreter, one among a thousand,
<dd>to show to man what is right for him;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,24);</script>then God is gracious
to him, and says,
<dd>‘Deliver him from going down to the pit,

<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,25);</script>His flesh shall be
fresher than a child’s.
<dd>He returns to the days of his youth.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,26);</script>He prays to God, and
he is favorable to him,
<dd>so that he sees his face with joy.
<dd>He restores to man his righteousness.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,27);</script>He sings before men,
and says,
<dd>‘I have sinned, and perverted that which was right,

soul from going into the pit.
<dd>My life shall see the light.’
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,29);</script>“Behold, God works
all these things,

soul from the pit,
<dd>that he may be enlightened with the light of the living.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(33,31);</script>Mark well, Job, and
listen to me.

<p>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,1);</script>Moreover Elihu

<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,2);</script>“Hear my words, you
wise men.
<dd>Give ear to me, you who have knowledge.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,3);</script>For the ear tries
words,
<dd>as the palate tastes food.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,4);</script>Let us choose for us
that which is right.
<dd>Let us know among ourselves what is good.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,5);</script>For Job has said,
‘I am righteous,
<dd>God has taken away my right:
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,6);</script>Notwithstanding my
right I am considered a liar.
<dd>My wound is incurable, though I am without disobedience.’
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,7);</script>What man is like Job,
<dd>who drinks scorn like water,
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,8);</script>Who goes in company
with the workers of iniquity,
<dd>and walks with wicked men?
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,9);</script>For he has said,
‘It profits a man nothing
<dd>that he should delight himself with God.’
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,10);</script>“Therefore listen
to me, you men of understanding:
<dd>far be it from God, that he should do wickedness,
<dd>from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,11);</script>For the work of a
man he will render to him,
<dd>and cause every man to find according to his ways.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,12);</script>Yes surely, God will
not do wickedly,
<dd>neither will the Almighty pervert justice.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,13);</script>Who put him in
charge of the earth?
<dd>or who has appointed him over the whole world?
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,14);</script>If he set his heart
on himself,
<dd>If he gathered to himself his spirit and his breath,
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,15);</script>all flesh would
perish together,
<dd>and man would turn again to dust.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,16);</script>“If now you have
understanding, hear this.
<dd>Listen to the voice of my words.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,17);</script>Shall even one who
hates justice govern?
<dd>Will you condemn him who is righteous and mighty?—
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,18);</script>Who says to a king,
‘Vile!’
<dd>or to nobles, ‘Wicked!’?
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,19);</script>Who doesn’t
respect the persons of princes,
<dd>nor respects the rich more than the poor;
<dd>for they all are the work of his hands.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,20);</script>In a moment they
die, even at midnight.
<dd>The people are shaken and pass away.
<dd>The mighty are taken away without a hand.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,21);</script>“For his eyes are
on the ways of a man.
<dd>He sees all his goings.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,22);</script>There is no
darkness, nor thick gloom,
<dd>where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,23);</script>For he doesn’t
need to consider a man further,
<dd>that he should go before God in judgment.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,24);</script>He breaks in pieces
mighty men in ways past finding out,
<dd>and sets others in their place.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,25);</script>Therefore he takes
knowledge of their works.
<dd>He overturns them in the night, so that they are destroyed.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,26);</script>He strikes them as
wicked men
<dd>in the open sight of others;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,27);</script>because they turned
aside from following him,
<dd>and wouldn’t pay attention to any of his ways,
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,28);</script>so that they caused
the cry of the poor to come to him.
<dd>He heard the cry of the afflicted.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,29);</script>When he gives
quietness, who then can condemn?
<dd>When he hides his face, who then can see him?
<dd>Alike whether to a nation, or to a man,
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,30);</script>that the godless man
may not reign,
<dd>that there be no one to ensnare the people.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,31);</script>“For has any said
to God,
<dd>‘I am guilty, but I will not offend any more.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,32);</script>Teach me that which
I don’t see.
<dd>If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more’?
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,33);</script>Shall his recompense
be as you desire, that you refuse it?
<dd>For you must choose, and not I.
<dd>Therefore speak what you know.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,34);</script>Men of understanding
will tell me,
<dd>yes, every wise man who hears me:

without knowledge.
<dd>His words are without wisdom.’
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,36);</script>I wish that Job were
tried to the end,
<dd>because of his answering like wicked men.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(34,37);</script>For he adds
rebellion to his sin.
<dd>He claps his hands among us,
<dd>and multiplies his words against God.”
</dl>
<p>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,1);</script>Moreover Elihu
answered,
<dl>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,2);</script>“Do you think this
to be your right,
<dd>or do you say, ‘My righteousness is more than God’s,’
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,3);</script>That you ask, ‘What
advantage will it be to you?
<dd>What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned?’
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,4);</script>I will answer you,
<dd>and your companions with you.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,5);</script>Look to the heavens,
and see.
<dd>See the skies, which are higher than you.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,6);</script>If you have sinned,
what effect do you have against him?
<dd>If your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to him?
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,7);</script>If you are righteous,
what do you give him?
<dd>Or what does he receive from your hand?
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,8);</script>Your wickedness may
hurt a man as you are,
<dd>and your righteousness may profit a son of man.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,9);</script>“By reason of the
multitude of oppressions they cry out.
<dd>They cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,10);</script>But none says,
‘Where is God my Maker,
<dd>who gives songs in the night,
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,11);</script>who teaches us more
than the animals of the earth,
<dd>and makes us wiser than the birds of the sky?’
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,12);</script>There they cry, but
none gives answer,
<dd>because of the pride of evil men.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,13);</script>Surely God will not
hear an empty cry,
<dd>neither will the Almighty regard it.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,14);</script>How much less when
you say you don’t see him.
<dd>The cause is before him, and you wait for him!
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,15);</script>But now, because he
has not visited in his anger,
<dd>neither does he greatly regard arrogance.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(35,16);</script>Therefore Job opens
his mouth with empty talk,
<dd>and he multiplies words without knowledge.”
</dl>
<p>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,1);</script>Elihu also continued,
and said,
<dl>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,2);</script>“Bear with me a
little, and I will show you;
<dd>for I still have something to say on God’s behalf.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,3);</script>I will get my
knowledge from afar,
<dd>and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,4);</script>For truly my words
are not false.
<dd>One who is perfect in knowledge is with you.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,5);</script>“Behold, God is
mighty, and doesn’t despise anyone.
<dd>He is mighty in strength of understanding.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,6);</script>He doesn’t preserve
the life of the wicked,
<dd>but gives to the afflicted their right.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,7);</script>He doesn’t withdraw
his eyes from the righteous,
<dd>but with kings on the throne,
<dd>he sets them forever, and they are exalted.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,8);</script>If they are bound in
fetters,
<dd>and are taken in the cords of afflictions,
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,9);</script>then he shows them
their work,
<dd>and their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,10);</script>He also opens their
ears to instruction,
<dd>and commands that they return from iniquity.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,11);</script>If they listen and
serve him,
<dd>they shall spend their days in prosperity,
<dd>and their years in pleasures.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,12);</script>But if they don’t
listen, they shall perish by the sword;
<dd>they shall die without knowledge.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,13);</script>“But those who are
godless in heart lay up anger.
<dd>They don’t cry for help when he binds them.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,14);</script>They die in youth.
<dd>Their life perishes among the unclean.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,15);</script>He delivers the
afflicted by their affliction,

<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,16);</script>Yes, he would have
allured you out of distress,
<dd>into a broad place, where there is no restriction.

<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,17);</script>“But you are full
of the judgment of the wicked.

entice you to wrath,
<dd>neither let the great size of a bribe turn you aside.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,19);</script>Would your wealth
sustain you in distress,

<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,20);</script>Don’t desire the
night,

<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,21);</script>Take heed, don’t
regard iniquity;

<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,22);</script>Behold, God is
exalted in his power.
<dd>Who is a teacher like him?
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,23);</script>Who has prescribed
his way for him?

<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(36,24);</script>“Remember that you
magnify his work,

</dl>
<p>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,1);</script>Then Job answered
Yahweh,
<dl>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,2);</script>“I know that you
can do all things,
<dd>and that no purpose of yours can be restrained.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,3);</script>You asked, ‘Who is
this who hides counsel without knowledge?’
<dd>therefore I have uttered that which I did not understand,
<dd>things too wonderful for me, which I didn’t know.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,4);</script>You said, ‘Listen,
now, and I will speak;
<dd>I will question you, and you will answer me.’
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,5);</script>I had heard of you by
the hearing of the ear,
<dd>but now my eye sees you.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,6);</script>Therefore I abhor
myself,
<dd>and repent in dust and ashes.”
</dl>
<p>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,7);</script>It was so, that after
Yahweh had spoken these words to Job, Yahweh said to Eliphaz the Temanite,
“My wrath is kindled against you, and against your two friends; for you
have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(42,8);</script>Now therefore, take to
yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer
up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you,
for I will accept him, that I not deal with you according to your folly.
For you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job
has.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,9);</script>So Eliphaz the
Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did
what Yahweh commanded them, and Yahweh accepted Job.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,10);</script>Yahweh turned the
captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends. Yahweh gave Job twice as
much as he had before. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(42,11);</script>Then came there to him all his
brothers, and all his sisters, and all those who had been of his
acquaintance before, and ate bread with him in his house. They comforted
him, and consoled him concerning all the evil that Yahweh had brought on
him. Everyone also gave him a <a href="#N15">piece of money,</a> and
everyone a ring of gold.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(42,12);</script>So Yahweh blessed the
latter end of Job more than his beginning. He had fourteen thousand sheep,
six thousand camels, one thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand female
donkeys. <script type="text/javascript">cb(42,13);</script>He had also
seven sons and three daughters. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(42,14);</script>He called the name of the first,
Jemimah; and the name of the second, Keziah; and the name of the third,
Keren Happuch. <script type="text/javascript">cb(42,15);</script>In all
the land were no women found so beautiful as the daughters of Job. Their
father gave them an inheritance among their brothers. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(42,16);</script>After this Job lived one hundred
forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons’ sons, to four generations.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(42,17);</script>So Job died, being old
and full of days.
