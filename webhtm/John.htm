The Good News According to John
</h1><p>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,1);</script>In the beginning was the
Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,2);</script>The same was in the beginning with
God. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,3);</script>All things were made
through him. Without him was not anything made that has been made. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,4);</script>In him was life, and the life was
the light of men. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,5);</script>The
light shines in the darkness, and the darkness hasn’t <a
href="#N1">overcome</a> it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,6);</script>There came a man, sent from God,
whose name was John. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,7);</script>The
same came as a witness, that he might testify about the light, that all
might believe through him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,8);</script>He was not the light, but was sent
that he might testify about the light. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,9);</script>The true light that enlightens
everyone was coming into the world.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,10);</script>He was in the world,
and the world was made through him, and the world didn’t recognize him.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,11);</script>He came to his own, and
those who were his own didn’t receive him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,12);</script>But as many as received him, to
them he gave the right to become God’s children, to those who believe in
his name: <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,13);</script>who were born
not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of
God. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,14);</script>The Word became
flesh, and lived among us. We saw his glory, such glory as of the one and
only Son of the Father, full of grace and truth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,15);</script>John testified about him. He
cried out, saying, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me
has surpassed me, for he was before me.’” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,16);</script>From his fullness we all received
grace upon grace. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,17);</script>For the
law was given through Moses. Grace and truth were realized through Jesus
Christ. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,18);</script>No one has seen
God at any time. The one and only <a href="#N2">Son,</a> who is in the
bosom of the Father, he has declared him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,19);</script>This is John’s
testimony, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask
him, “Who are you?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,20);</script>He declared, and
didn’t deny, but he declared, “I am not the Christ.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,21);</script>They asked him,
“What then? Are you Elijah?”
<p>He said, “I am not.”
<p>“Are you the prophet?”
<p>He answered, “No.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,22);</script>They said therefore to
him, “Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us.
What do you say about yourself?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,23);</script>He said, “I am the
voice of one crying in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the
Lord,’<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N3">*</a></sup></font> as Isaiah the prophet said.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,24);</script>The ones who had been
sent were from the Pharisees. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,25);</script>They asked him, “Why then do
you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,26);</script>John answered them,
“I baptize in water, but among you stands one whom you don’t know.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,27);</script>He is the one who comes
after me, who is preferred before me, whose sandal strap I’m not worthy
to loosen.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,28);</script>These
things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,29);</script>The next day, he saw
Jesus coming to him, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away
the sin of the world! <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,30);</script>This is he of whom I said,
‘After me comes a man who is preferred before me, for he was before
me.’ <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,31);</script>I didn’t know
him, but for this reason I came baptizing in water: that he would be
revealed to Israel.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,32);</script>John testified, saying, “I have
seen the Spirit descending like a dove out of heaven, and it remained on
him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,33);</script>I didn’t recognize
him, but he who sent me to baptize in water, he said to me, ‘On whomever
you will see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he
who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,34);</script>I have seen, and have testified
that this is the Son of God.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,35);</script>Again, the next day,
John was standing with two of his disciples, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,36);</script>and he looked at Jesus as he
walked, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,37);</script>The two disciples heard him
speak, and they followed Jesus. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,38);</script>Jesus turned, and saw them
following, and said to them, <span class="j">“What are you looking
for?”</span>
<p>They said to him, “Rabbi” (which is to say, being interpreted,
Teacher), “where are you staying?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,39);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Come, and see.”</span>
<p>They came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that
day. It was about <a href="#N4">the tenth hour.</a> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,40);</script>One of the two who heard John,
and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,41);</script>He first found his own brother,
Simon, and said to him, “We have found the Messiah!” (which is, being
interpreted, <a href="#N5">Christ</a>). <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,42);</script>He brought him to Jesus. Jesus
looked at him, and said, <span class="j">“You are Simon the son of
Jonah. You shall be called Cephas”</span> (which is by interpretation,
Peter). <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,43);</script>On the next day,
he was determined to go out into Galilee, and he found Philip. Jesus said
to him, <span class="j">“Follow me.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,44);</script>Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of
the city of Andrew and Peter. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,45);</script>Philip found Nathanael, and said
to him, “We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets,
wrote: Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,46);</script>Nathanael said to him,
“Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?”
<p>Philip said to him, “Come and see.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,47);</script>Jesus saw Nathanael
coming to him, and said about him, <span class="j">“Behold, an Israelite
indeed, in whom is no deceit!”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,48);</script>Nathanael said to him,
“How do you know me?”
<p>Jesus answered him, <span class="j">“Before Philip called you, when
you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,49);</script>Nathanael answered
him, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are King of Israel!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,50);</script>Jesus answered him,
<span class="j">“Because I told you, ‘I saw you underneath the fig
tree,’ do you believe? You will see greater things than these!”</span>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,51);</script>He said to him, <span
class="j">“Most certainly, I tell you, hereafter you will see heaven
opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of
Man.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,1);</script>The third day, there
was a marriage in Cana of Galilee. Jesus’ mother was there. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,2);</script>Jesus also was invited, with his
disciples, to the marriage. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,3);</script>When the wine ran out, Jesus’
mother said to him, “They have no wine.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,4);</script>Jesus said to her,
<span class="j">“Woman, what does that have to do with you and me? My
hour has not yet come.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,5);</script>His mother said to the
servants, “Whatever he says to you, do it.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,6);</script>Now there were six water pots of
stone set there after the Jews’ way of purifying, containing <a
href="#N6">two or three metretes</a> apiece. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,7);</script>Jesus said to them, <span
class="j">“Fill the water pots with water.”</span> They filled them up
to the brim. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,8);</script>He said to
them, <span class="j">“Now draw some out, and take it to the ruler of
the feast.”</span> So they took it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,9);</script>When the ruler of the feast tasted
the water now become wine, and didn’t know where it came from (but the
servants who had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the feast called the
bridegroom, <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,10);</script>and said to
him, “Everyone serves the good wine first, and when the guests have
drunk freely, then that which is worse. You have kept the good wine until
now!” <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,11);</script>This beginning of
his signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and revealed his glory; and his
disciples believed in him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,12);</script>After this, he went
down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, his brothers, and his disciples;
and they stayed there a few days. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,13);</script>The Passover of the Jews was at
hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,14);</script>He found in the temple those who
sold oxen, sheep, and doves, and the changers of money sitting. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,15);</script>He made a whip of cords, and
threw all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured
out the changers’ money, and overthrew their tables. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,16);</script>To those who sold the doves, he
said, <span class="j">“Take these things out of here! Don’t make my
Father’s house a marketplace!”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,17);</script>His disciples remembered that it
was written, “Zeal for your house will eat me up.”<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N7">*</a></sup></font>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,18);</script>The Jews therefore
answered him, “What sign do you show us, seeing that you do these
things?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,19);</script>Jesus answered them,
<span class="j">“Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it
up.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,20);</script>The Jews therefore
said, “It took forty-six years to build this temple! Will you raise it
up in three days?” <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,21);</script>But
he spoke of the temple of his body. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,22);</script>When therefore he was raised from
the dead, his disciples remembered that he said this, and they believed
the Scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,23);</script>Now when he was in
Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in his name,
observing his signs which he did. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,24);</script>But Jesus didn’t trust himself
to them, because he knew everyone, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,25);</script>and because he didn’t need for
anyone to testify concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,1);</script>Now there was a man of
the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,2);</script>The same came to him by night, and
said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for
no one can do these signs that you do, unless God is with him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,3);</script>Jesus answered him,
<span class="j">“Most certainly, I tell you, unless one is born <a
href="#N8">anew,</a> he can’t see the Kingdom of God.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,4);</script>Nicodemus said to him,
“How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into
his mother’s womb, and be born?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,5);</script>Jesus answered, <span
class="j">“Most certainly I tell you, unless one is born of water and
spirit, he can’t enter into the Kingdom of God! <script
type="text/javascript">cj(3,6);</script>That which is born of the flesh is
flesh. That which is born of the Spirit is spirit. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(3,7);</script>Don’t marvel that I said to you,
‘You must be born anew.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(3,8);</script>The <a href="#N9">wind</a> blows
where it wants to, and you hear its sound, but don’t know where it comes
from and where it is going. So is everyone who is born of the
Spirit.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,9);</script>Nicodemus answered him,
“How can these things be?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,10);</script>Jesus answered him,
<span class="j">“Are you the teacher of Israel, and don’t understand
these things? <script type="text/javascript">cj(3,11);</script>Most
certainly I tell you, we speak that which we know, and testify of that
which we have seen, and you don’t receive our witness. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(3,12);</script>If I told you earthly things and
you don’t believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?
<script type="text/javascript">cj(3,13);</script>No one has ascended into
heaven, but he who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man, who is in
heaven. <script type="text/javascript">cj(3,14);</script>As Moses lifted
up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted
up, <script type="text/javascript">cj(3,15);</script>that whoever believes
in him should not perish, but have eternal life. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(3,16);</script>For God so loved the world, that
he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him should not
perish, but have eternal life. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(3,17);</script>For God didn’t send his Son
into the world to judge the world, but that the world should be saved
through him. <script type="text/javascript">cj(3,18);</script>He who
believes in him is not judged. He who doesn’t believe has been judged
already, because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son
of God. <script type="text/javascript">cj(3,19);</script>This is the
judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the
darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(3,20);</script>For everyone who does evil hates
the light, and doesn’t come to the light, lest his works would be
exposed. <script type="text/javascript">cj(3,21);</script>But he who does
the truth comes to the light, that his works may be revealed, that they
have been done in God.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,22);</script>After these things,
Jesus came with his disciples into the land of Judea. He stayed there with
them, and baptized. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,23);</script>John
also was baptizing in Enon near Salim, because there was much water there.
They came, and were baptized. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,24);</script>For John was not yet thrown into
prison. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,25);</script>There arose
therefore a questioning on the part of John’s disciples with some Jews
about purification. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,26);</script>They
came to John, and said to him, “Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the
Jordan, to whom you have testified, behold, the same baptizes, and
everyone is coming to him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,27);</script>John answered, “A
man can receive nothing, unless it has been given him from heaven. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,28);</script>You yourselves testify that I
said, ‘I am not the Christ,’ but, ‘I have been sent before him.’
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,29);</script>He who has the bride is
the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears
him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice. This, my joy,
therefore is made full. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,30);</script>He must increase, but I must
decrease. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,31);</script>He who comes
from above is above all. He who is from the earth belongs to the earth,
and speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,32);</script>What he has seen and heard, of
that he testifies; and no one receives his witness. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,33);</script>He who has received his witness
has set his seal to this, that God is true. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,34);</script>For he whom God has sent speaks
the words of God; for God gives the Spirit without measure. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,35);</script>The Father loves the Son, and has
given all things into his hand. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,36);</script>One who believes in the Son has
eternal life, but one who <a href="#N10">disobeys</a> the Son won’t see
life, but the wrath of God remains on him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,1);</script>Therefore when the Lord
knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more
disciples than John <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,2);</script>(although Jesus himself didn’t
baptize, but his disciples), <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,3);</script>he left Judea, and departed into
Galilee. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,4);</script>He needed to pass
through Samaria. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,5);</script>So he
came to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the parcel of ground that
Jacob gave to his son, Joseph. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,6);</script>Jacob’s well was there. Jesus
therefore, being tired from his journey, sat down by the well. It was
about <a href="#N11">the sixth hour</a>. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,7);</script>A woman of Samaria came to draw
water. Jesus said to her, <span class="j">“Give me a drink.”</span>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,8);</script>For his disciples had gone
away into the city to buy food.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,9);</script>The Samaritan woman
therefore said to him, “How is it that you, being a Jew, ask for a drink
from me, a Samaritan woman?” (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,10);</script>Jesus answered her,
<span class="j">“If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to
you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have
given you living water.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,11);</script>The woman said to him,
“Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. From where
then have you that living water? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,12);</script>Are you greater than our father,
Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, as did his children,
and his livestock?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,13);</script>Jesus answered her,
<span class="j">“Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again,
<script type="text/javascript">cj(4,14);</script>but whoever drinks of the
water that I will give him will never thirst again; but the water that I
will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal
life.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,15);</script>The woman said to him,
“Sir, give me this water, so that I don’t get thirsty, neither come
all the way here to draw.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,16);</script>Jesus said to her,
<span class="j">“Go, call your husband, and come here.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,17);</script>The woman answered,
“I have no husband.”
<p>Jesus said to her, <span class="j">“You said well, ‘I have no
husband,’ <script type="text/javascript">cj(4,18);</script>for you have
had five husbands; and he whom you now have is not your husband. This you
have said truly.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,19);</script>The woman said to him,
“Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,20);</script>Our fathers worshiped in this
mountain, and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where people
ought to worship.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,21);</script>Jesus said to her,
<span class="j">“Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when neither in this
mountain, nor in Jerusalem, will you worship the Father. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(4,22);</script>You worship that which you
don’t know. We worship that which we know; for salvation is from the
Jews. <script type="text/javascript">cj(4,23);</script>But the hour comes,
and now is, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit
and truth, for the Father seeks such to be his worshippers. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(4,24);</script>God is spirit, and those who
worship him must worship in spirit and truth.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,25);</script>The woman said to him,
“I know that Messiah comes,” (he who is called Christ). “When he has
come, he will declare to us all things.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,26);</script>Jesus said to her,
<span class="j">“I am he, the one who speaks to you.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,27);</script>At this, his disciples came. They
marveled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no one said, “What are
you looking for?” or, “Why do you speak with her?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,28);</script>So the woman left her water pot,
and went away into the city, and said to the people, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,29);</script>“Come, see a man who told me
everything that I did. Can this be the Christ?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,30);</script>They went out of the
city, and were coming to him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,31);</script>In the meanwhile, the disciples
urged him, saying, “Rabbi, eat.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,32);</script>But he said to them,
<span class="j">“I have food to eat that you don’t know
about.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,33);</script>The disciples
therefore said one to another, “Has anyone brought him something to
eat?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,34);</script>Jesus said to them,
<span class="j">“My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to
accomplish his work. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(4,35);</script>Don’t you say, ‘There are yet
four months until the harvest?’ Behold, I tell you, lift up your eyes,
and look at the fields, that they are white for harvest already. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(4,36);</script>He who reaps receives wages, and
gathers fruit to eternal life; that both he who sows and he who reaps may
rejoice together. <script type="text/javascript">cj(4,37);</script>For in
this the saying is true, ‘One sows, and another reaps.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(4,38);</script>I sent you to reap that for which
you haven’t labored. Others have labored, and you have entered into
their labor.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,39);</script>From that city many of
the Samaritans believed in him because of the word of the woman, who
testified, “He told me everything that I did.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,40);</script>So when the Samaritans came to
him, they begged him to stay with them. He stayed there two days. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,41);</script>Many more believed because of his
word. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,42);</script>They said to the
woman, “Now we believe, not because of your speaking; for we have heard
for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the
world.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,43);</script>After the two days he
went out from there and went into Galilee. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,44);</script>For Jesus himself testified that
a prophet has no honor in his own country. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,45);</script>So when he came into Galilee, the
Galileans received him, having seen all the things that he did in
Jerusalem at the feast, for they also went to the feast. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,46);</script>Jesus came therefore again to
Cana of Galilee, where he made the water into wine. There was a certain
nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,47);</script>When he heard that Jesus had come
out of Judea into Galilee, he went to him, and begged him that he would
come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,48);</script>Jesus therefore said to him,
<span class="j">“Unless you see signs and wonders, you will in no way
believe.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,49);</script>The nobleman said to
him, “Sir, come down before my child dies.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,50);</script>Jesus said to him, <span
class="j">“Go your way. Your son lives.”</span> The man believed the
word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,51);</script>As he was now going down, his
servants met him and reported, saying “Your child lives!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,52);</script>So he inquired of them the hour
when he began to get better. They said therefore to him, “Yesterday at
the <a href="#N12">seventh hour,</a> the fever left him.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,53);</script>So the father knew that it was at
that hour in which Jesus said to him, <span class="j">“Your son
lives.”</span> He believed, as did his whole house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,54);</script>This is again the second sign
that Jesus did, having come out of Judea into Galilee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,1);</script>After these things,
there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,2);</script>Now in Jerusalem by the sheep
gate, there is a pool, which is called in Hebrew, “Bethesda,” having
five porches. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,3);</script>In these lay
a great multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, or paralyzed,
waiting for the moving of the water; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,4);</script>for an angel went down at certain
times into the pool, and stirred up the water. Whoever stepped in first
after the stirring of the water was made whole of whatever disease he had.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(5,5);</script>A certain man was there,
who had been sick for thirty-eight years. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,6);</script>When Jesus saw him lying there,
and knew that he had been sick for a long time, he asked him, <span
class="j">“Do you want to be made well?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,7);</script>The sick man answered
him, “Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is
stirred up, but while I’m coming, another steps down before me.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,8);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“Arise, take up your mat, and walk.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,9);</script>Immediately, the man
was made well, and took up his mat and walked.
<p>Now it was the Sabbath on that day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,10);</script>So the Jews said to him who was
cured, “It is the Sabbath. It is not lawful for you to carry the mat.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,11);</script>He answered them,
“He who made me well, the same said to me, <span class="j">‘Take up
your mat, and walk.’</span>”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,12);</script>Then they asked him,
“Who is the man who said to you, <span class="j">‘Take up your mat,
and walk’</span>?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,13);</script>But he who was healed
didn’t know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, a crowd being in the
place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,14);</script>Afterward Jesus found
him in the temple, and said to him, <span class="j">“Behold, you are
made well. Sin no more, so that nothing worse happens to you.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,15);</script>The man went away, and
told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,16);</script>For this cause the Jews
persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill him, because he did these things on
the Sabbath. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,17);</script>But Jesus
answered them, <span class="j">“My Father is still working, so I am
working, too.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,18);</script>For this cause therefore the Jews
sought all the more to kill him, because he not only broke the Sabbath,
but also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,19);</script>Jesus therefore answered them,
<span class="j">“Most certainly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing of
himself, but what he sees the Father doing. For whatever things he does,
these the Son also does likewise. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,20);</script>For the Father has affection for
the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does. He will show him
greater works than these, that you may marvel. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,21);</script>For as the Father raises the dead
and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom he desires.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(5,22);</script>For the Father judges no
one, but he has given all judgment to the Son, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,23);</script>that all may honor the Son, even
as they honor the Father. He who doesn’t honor the Son doesn’t honor
the Father who sent him.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,24);</script>“Most certainly I tell you, he
who hears my word, and believes him who sent me, has eternal life, and
doesn’t come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(5,25);</script>Most certainly, I tell
you, the hour comes, and now is, when the dead will hear the Son of
God’s voice; and those who hear will live. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,26);</script>For as the Father has life in
himself, even so he gave to the Son also to have life in himself. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,27);</script>He also gave him authority to
execute judgment, because he is a son of man. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,28);</script>Don’t marvel at this, for the
hour comes, in which all that are in the tombs will hear his voice,
<script type="text/javascript">cj(5,29);</script>and will come out; those
who have done good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have done
evil, to the resurrection of judgment. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,30);</script>I can of myself do nothing. As I
hear, I judge, and my judgment is righteous; because I don’t seek my own
will, but the will of my Father who sent me.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,31);</script>“If I testify about myself, my
witness is not valid. <script type="text/javascript">cj(5,32);</script>It
is another who testifies about me. I know that the testimony which he
testifies about me is true. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,33);</script>You have sent to John, and he has
testified to the truth. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,34);</script>But the testimony which I receive
is not from man. However, I say these things that you may be saved.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(5,35);</script>He was the burning and
shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(5,36);</script>But the testimony which I
have is greater than that of John, for the works which the Father gave me
to accomplish, the very works that I do, testify about me, that the Father
has sent me. <script type="text/javascript">cj(5,37);</script>The Father
himself, who sent me, has testified about me. You have neither heard his
voice at any time, nor seen his form. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,38);</script>You don’t have his word living
in you; because you don’t believe him whom he sent.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,39);</script>“You search the Scriptures,
because you think that in them you have eternal life; and these are they
which testify about me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,40);</script>Yet you will not come to me, that
you may have life. <script type="text/javascript">cj(5,41);</script>I
don’t receive glory from men. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,42);</script>But I know you, that you don’t
have God’s love in yourselves. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,43);</script>I have come in my Father’s
name, and you don’t receive me. If another comes in his own name, you
will receive him. <script type="text/javascript">cj(5,44);</script>How can
you believe, who receive glory from one another, and you don’t seek the
glory that comes from the only God?
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,45);</script>“Don’t think that I will
accuse you to the Father. There is one who accuses you, even Moses, on
whom you have set your hope. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,46);</script>For if you believed Moses, you
would believe me; for he wrote about me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,47);</script>But if you don’t believe his
writings, how will you believe my words?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,1);</script>After these things,
Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee, which is also
called the Sea of Tiberias. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,2);</script>A great multitude followed him,
because they saw his signs which he did on those who were sick. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,3);</script>Jesus went up into the mountain,
and he sat there with his disciples. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,4);</script>Now the Passover, the feast of the
Jews, was at hand. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,5);</script>Jesus
therefore lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a great multitude was
coming to him, said to Philip, <span class="j">“Where are we to buy
bread, that these may eat?”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,6);</script>This he said to test him, for he
himself knew what he would do.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,7);</script>Philip answered him,
“Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that
everyone of them may receive a little.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,8);</script>One of his disciples,
Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said to him, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,9);</script>“There is a boy here who has
five barley loaves and two fish, but what are these among so many?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,10);</script>Jesus said, <span
class="j">“Have the people sit down.”</span> Now there was much grass
in that place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,11);</script>Jesus took the loaves; and having
given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to those
who were sitting down; likewise also of the fish as much as they desired.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(6,12);</script>When they were filled, he
said to his disciples, <span class="j">“Gather up the broken pieces
which are left over, that nothing be lost.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,13);</script>So they gathered them up, and
filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves,
which were left over by those who had eaten. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,14);</script>When therefore the people saw the
sign which Jesus did, they said, “This is truly the prophet who comes
into the world.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,15);</script>Jesus
therefore, perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force,
to make him king, withdrew again to the mountain by himself.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,16);</script>When evening came, his
disciples went down to the sea, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,17);</script>and they entered into the boat,
and were going over the sea to Capernaum. It was now dark, and Jesus had
not come to them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,18);</script>The sea
was tossed by a great wind blowing. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,19);</script>When therefore they had rowed
about <a href="#N13">twenty-five or thirty stadia,</a> they saw Jesus
walking on the sea,<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N14">*</a></sup></font> and drawing near to the boat; and they were
afraid. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,20);</script>But he said to
them, <span class="j">“<a href="#N15">It is I</a>. Don’t be
afraid.”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,21);</script>They
were willing therefore to receive him into the boat. Immediately the boat
was at the land where they were going.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,22);</script>On the next day, the
multitude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no
other boat there, except the one in which his disciples had embarked, and
that Jesus hadn’t entered with his disciples into the boat, but his
disciples had gone away alone. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,23);</script>However boats from Tiberias came
near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given
thanks. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,24);</script>When the
multitude therefore saw that Jesus wasn’t there, nor his disciples, they
themselves got into the boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(6,25);</script>When they found him on
the other side of the sea, they asked him, “Rabbi, when did you come
here?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,26);</script>Jesus answered them,
<span class="j">“Most certainly I tell you, you seek me, not because you
saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves, and were filled. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,27);</script>Don’t work for the food which
perishes, but for the food which remains to eternal life, which the Son of
Man will give to you. For God the Father has sealed him.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,28);</script>They said therefore to
him, “What must we do, that we may work the works of God?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,29);</script>Jesus answered them,
<span class="j">“This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom
he has sent.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,30);</script>They said therefore to
him, “What then do you do for a sign, that we may see, and believe you?
What work do you do? <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,31);</script>Our
fathers ate the manna in the wilderness. As it is written, ‘He gave them
bread out of <a href="#N16">heaven</a> to eat.’”<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N17">*</a></sup></font>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,32);</script>Jesus therefore said
to them, <span class="j">“Most certainly, I tell you, it wasn’t Moses
who gave you the bread out of heaven, but my Father gives you the true
bread out of heaven. <script type="text/javascript">cj(6,33);</script>For
the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven, and gives life to
the world.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,34);</script>They said therefore to
him, “Lord, always give us this bread.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,35);</script>Jesus said to them,
<span class="j">“I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will not be
hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,36);</script>But I told you that you have seen
me, and yet you don’t believe. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,37);</script>All those whom the Father gives
me will come to me. He who comes to me I will in no way throw out. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,38);</script>For I have come down from heaven,
not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,39);</script>This is the will of my Father who
sent me, that of all he has given to me I should lose nothing, but should
raise him up at the last day. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,40);</script>This is the will of the one who
sent me, that everyone who sees the Son, and believes in him, should have
eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,41);</script>The Jews therefore
murmured concerning him, because he said, <span class="j">“I am the
bread which came down out of heaven.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,42);</script>They said, “Isn’t this Jesus,
the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How then does he say,
<span class="j">‘I have come down out of heaven?’”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,43);</script>Therefore Jesus
answered them, <span class="j">“Don’t murmur among yourselves. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,44);</script>No one can come to me unless the
Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up in the last day.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(6,45);</script>It is written in the
prophets, ‘They will all be taught by God.’<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N18">*</a></sup></font> Therefore everyone who
hears from the Father, and has learned, comes to me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,46);</script>Not that anyone has seen the
Father, except he who is from God. He has seen the Father. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,47);</script>Most certainly, I tell you, he
who believes in me has eternal life. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,48);</script>I am the bread of life. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,49);</script>Your fathers ate the manna in the
wilderness, and they died. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,50);</script>This is the bread which comes
down out of heaven, that anyone may eat of it and not die. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,51);</script>I am the living bread which came
down out of heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever.
Yes, the bread which I will give for the life of the world is my
flesh.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,52);</script>The Jews therefore
contended with one another, saying, “How can this man give us his flesh
to eat?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,53);</script>Jesus therefore said
to them, <span class="j">“Most certainly I tell you, unless you eat the
flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you don’t have life in
yourselves. <script type="text/javascript">cj(6,54);</script>He who eats
my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at
the last day. <script type="text/javascript">cj(6,55);</script>For my
flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,56);</script>He who eats my flesh and drinks
my blood lives in me, and I in him. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,57);</script>As the living Father sent me, and
I live because of the Father; so he who feeds on me, he will also live
because of me. <script type="text/javascript">cj(6,58);</script>This is
the bread which came down out of heaven—not as our fathers ate the
manna, and died. He who eats this bread will live forever.”</span>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(6,59);</script>He said these things in
the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,60);</script>Therefore many of his
disciples, when they heard this, said, “This is a hard saying! Who can
listen to it?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,61);</script>But Jesus knowing in
himself that his disciples murmured at this, said to them, <span
class="j">“Does this cause you to stumble? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,62);</script>Then what if you would see the
Son of Man ascending to where he was before? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,63);</script>It is the spirit who gives life.
The flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit, and
are life. <script type="text/javascript">cj(6,64);</script>But there are
some of you who don’t believe.”</span> For Jesus knew from the
beginning who they were who didn’t believe, and who it was who would
betray him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,65);</script>He said,
<span class="j">“For this cause have I said to you that no one can come
to me, unless it is given to him by my Father.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,66);</script>At this, many of his
disciples went back, and walked no more with him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,67);</script>Jesus said therefore to the
twelve, <span class="j">“You don’t also want to go away, do
you?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,68);</script>Simon Peter answered
him, “Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(6,69);</script>We have come to believe
and know that you are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,70);</script>Jesus answered them,
<span class="j">“Didn’t I choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a
devil?”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,71);</script>Now he
spoke of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, for it was he who would betray
him, being one of the twelve.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,1);</script>After these things,
Jesus was walking in Galilee, for he wouldn’t walk in Judea, because the
Jews sought to kill him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,2);</script>Now the feast of the Jews, the
Feast of Booths, was at hand. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,3);</script>His brothers therefore said to
him, “Depart from here, and go into Judea, that your disciples also may
see your works which you do. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,4);</script>For no one does anything in
secret, and himself seeks to be known openly. If you do these things,
reveal yourself to the world.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,5);</script>For even his brothers didn’t
believe in him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,6);</script>Jesus therefore said to
them, <span class="j">“My time has not yet come, but your time is always
ready. <script type="text/javascript">cj(7,7);</script>The world can’t
hate you, but it hates me, because I testify about it, that its works are
evil. <script type="text/javascript">cj(7,8);</script>You go up to the
feast. I am not yet going up to this feast, because my time is not yet
fulfilled.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,9);</script>Having said these
things to them, he stayed in Galilee. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,10);</script>But when his brothers had gone up
to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly, but as it were in
secret. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,11);</script>The Jews
therefore sought him at the feast, and said, “Where is he?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,12);</script>There was much murmuring among
the multitudes concerning him. Some said, “He is a good man.” Others
said, “Not so, but he leads the multitude astray.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,13);</script>Yet no one spoke openly of him
for fear of the Jews. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,14);</script>But
when it was now the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and
taught. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,15);</script>The Jews
therefore marveled, saying, “How does this man know letters, having
never been educated?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,16);</script>Jesus therefore
answered them, <span class="j">“My teaching is not mine, but his who
sent me. <script type="text/javascript">cj(7,17);</script>If anyone
desires to do his will, he will know about the teaching, whether it is
from God, or if I am speaking from myself. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(7,18);</script>He who speaks from himself seeks
his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and
no unrighteousness is in him. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(7,19);</script>Didn’t Moses give you the law,
and yet none of you keeps the law? Why do you seek to kill me?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,20);</script>The multitude
answered, “You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,21);</script>Jesus answered them,
<span class="j">“I did one work, and you all marvel because of it.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(7,22);</script>Moses has given you
circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers), and on the
Sabbath you circumcise a boy. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(7,23);</script>If a boy receives circumcision on
the Sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with
me, because I made a man completely healthy on the Sabbath? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(7,24);</script>Don’t judge according to
appearance, but judge righteous judgment.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,25);</script>Therefore some of them
of Jerusalem said, “Isn’t this he whom they seek to kill? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,26);</script>Behold, he speaks openly, and
they say nothing to him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this
is truly the Christ? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,27);</script>However we know where this man
comes from, but when the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes
from.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,28);</script>Jesus therefore cried
out in the temple, teaching and saying, <span class="j">“You both know
me, and know where I am from. I have not come of myself, but he who sent
me is true, whom you don’t know. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(7,29);</script>I know him, because I am from
him, and he sent me.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,30);</script>They sought therefore
to take him; but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet
come. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,31);</script>But of the
multitude, many believed in him. They said, “When the Christ comes, he
won’t do more signs than those which this man has done, will he?”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,32);</script>The Pharisees heard the
multitude murmuring these things concerning him, and the chief priests and
the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,33);</script>Then Jesus said, <span
class="j">“I will be with you a little while longer, then I go to him
who sent me. <script type="text/javascript">cj(7,34);</script>You will
seek me, and won’t find me; and where I am, you can’t come.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,35);</script>The Jews therefore
said among themselves, “Where will this man go that we won’t find him?
Will he go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,36);</script>What is this word that he
said, <span class="j">‘You will seek me, and won’t find me; and where
I am, you can’t come’?</span>”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,37);</script>Now on the last and
greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, <span
class="j">“If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink! <script
type="text/javascript">cj(7,38);</script>He who believes in me, as the
Scripture has said, from within him will flow rivers of living
water.”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,39);</script>But he
said this about the Spirit, which those believing in him were to receive.
For the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus wasn’t yet
glorified.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,40);</script>Many of the multitude
therefore, when they heard these words, said, “This is truly the
prophet.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,41);</script>Others said,
“This is the Christ.” But some said, “What, does the Christ come out
of Galilee? <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,42);</script>Hasn’t the
Scripture said that the Christ comes of the seed of David,<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N19">*</a></sup></font> and from
Bethlehem,<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N20">*</a></sup></font> the village where David was?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,43);</script>So there arose a division in the
multitude because of him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,44);</script>Some of them would have arrested
him, but no one laid hands on him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,45);</script>The officers therefore came to
the chief priests and Pharisees, and they said to them, “Why didn’t
you bring him?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,46);</script>The officers answered,
“No man ever spoke like this man!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,47);</script>The Pharisees
therefore answered them, “You aren’t also led astray, are you? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,48);</script>Have any of the rulers believed
in him, or of the Pharisees? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,49);</script>But this multitude that doesn’t
know the law is accursed.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,50);</script>Nicodemus (he who came
to him by night, being one of them) said to them, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,51);</script>“Does our law judge a man,
unless it first hears from him personally and knows what he does?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,52);</script>They answered him,
“Are you also from Galilee? Search, and see that no prophet has arisen
out of Galilee.<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N21">*</a></sup></font>”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,53);</script>Everyone went to his
own house, <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,1);</script>but Jesus went
to the Mount of Olives. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,2);</script>Now very early in the morning, he
came again into the temple, and all the people came to him. He sat down,
and taught them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,3);</script>The
scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman taken in adultery. Having set
her in the midst, <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,4);</script>they
told him, “Teacher, we found this woman in adultery, in the very act.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,5);</script>Now in our law, Moses
commanded us to stone such.<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N22">*</a></sup></font> What then do you say about her?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,6);</script>They said this testing him, that
they might have something to accuse him of.
<p>But Jesus stooped down, and wrote on the ground with his finger.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,7);</script>But when they continued
asking him, he looked up and said to them, <span class="j">“He who is
without sin among you, let him throw the first stone at her.”</span>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,8);</script>Again he stooped down, and
with his finger wrote on the ground.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,9);</script>They, when they heard
it, being convicted by their conscience, went out one by one, beginning
from the oldest, even to the last. Jesus was left alone with the woman
where she was, in the middle. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,10);</script>Jesus, standing up, saw her and
said, <span class="j">“Woman, where are your accusers? Did no one
condemn you?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,11);</script>She said, “No one,
Lord.”
<p>Jesus said, <span class="j">“Neither do I condemn you. Go your way.
From now on, sin no more.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,12);</script>Again, therefore,
Jesus spoke to them, saying, <span class="j">“I am the light of the
world.<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N23">*</a></sup></font>
He who follows me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the light
of life.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,13);</script>The Pharisees
therefore said to him, “You testify about yourself. Your testimony is
not valid.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,14);</script>Jesus answered them,
<span class="j">“Even if I testify about myself, my testimony is true,
for I know where I came from, and where I am going; but you don’t know
where I came from, or where I am going. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,15);</script>You judge according to the flesh.
I judge no one. <script type="text/javascript">cj(8,16);</script>Even if I
do judge, my judgment is true, for I am not alone, but I am with the
Father who sent me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,17);</script>It’s also written in your law
that the testimony of two people is valid.<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N24">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,18);</script>I am one who testifies about
myself, and the Father who sent me testifies about me.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,19);</script>They said therefore to
him, “Where is your Father?”
<p>Jesus answered, <span class="j">“You know neither me, nor my Father.
If you knew me, you would know my Father also.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,20);</script>Jesus spoke these words in the
treasury, as he taught in the temple. Yet no one arrested him, because his
hour had not yet come. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,21);</script>Jesus said therefore again to
them, <span class="j">“I am going away, and you will seek me, and you
will die in your sins. Where I go, you can’t come.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,22);</script>The Jews therefore
said, “Will he kill himself, that he says, <span class="j">‘Where I am
going, you can’t come?’</span>”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,23);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“You are from beneath. I am from above. You are of this world.
I am not of this world. <script type="text/javascript">cj(8,24);</script>I
said therefore to you that you will die in your sins; for unless you
believe that <a href="#N25">I am</a> he, you will die in your
sins.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,25);</script>They said therefore to
him, “Who are you?”
<p>Jesus said to them, <span class="j">“Just what I have been saying to
you from the beginning. <script type="text/javascript">cj(8,26);</script>I
have many things to speak and to judge concerning you. However he who sent
me is true; and the things which I heard from him, these I say to the
world.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,27);</script>They didn’t
understand that he spoke to them about the Father. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,28);</script>Jesus therefore said to them,
<span class="j">“When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will
know that I am he, and I do nothing of myself, but as my Father taught me,
I say these things. <script type="text/javascript">cj(8,29);</script>He
who sent me is with me. The Father hasn’t left me alone, for I always do
the things that are pleasing to him.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,30);</script>As he spoke these
things, many believed in him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,31);</script>Jesus therefore said to those
Jews who had believed him, <span class="j">“If you remain in my word,
then you are truly my disciples. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,32);</script>You will know the truth, and the
truth will make you free.”</span><font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N26">*</a></sup></font>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,33);</script>They answered him,
“We are Abraham’s seed, and have never been in bondage to anyone. How
do you say, <span class="j">‘You will be made free?’</span>”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,34);</script>Jesus answered them,
<span class="j">“Most certainly I tell you, everyone who commits sin is
the bondservant of sin. <script type="text/javascript">cj(8,35);</script>A
bondservant doesn’t live in the house forever. A son remains forever.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(8,36);</script>If therefore the Son
makes you free, you will be free indeed. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,37);</script>I know that you are Abraham’s
seed, yet you seek to kill me, because my word finds no place in you.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(8,38);</script>I say the things which I
have seen with my Father; and you also do the things which you have seen
with your father.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,39);</script>They answered him,
“Our father is Abraham.”
<p>Jesus said to them, <span class="j">“If you were Abraham’s
children, you would do the works of Abraham. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,40);</script>But now you seek to kill me, a
man who has told you the truth, which I heard from God. Abraham didn’t
do this. <script type="text/javascript">cj(8,41);</script>You do the works
of your father.”</span>
<p>They said to him, “We were not born of sexual immorality. We have one
Father, God.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,42);</script>Therefore Jesus said
to them, <span class="j">“If God were your father, you would love me,
for I came out and have come from God. For I haven’t come of myself, but
he sent me. <script type="text/javascript">cj(8,43);</script>Why don’t
you understand my speech? Because you can’t hear my word. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,44);</script>You are of your father, the
devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer
from the beginning, and doesn’t stand in the truth, because there is no
truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks on his own; for he is a
liar, and its father. <script type="text/javascript">cj(8,45);</script>But
because I tell the truth, you don’t believe me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,46);</script>Which of you convicts me of sin?
If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,47);</script>He who is of God hears the words
of God. For this cause you don’t hear, because you are not of
God.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,48);</script>Then the Jews answered
him, “Don’t we say well that you are a Samaritan, and have a demon?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,49);</script>Jesus answered, <span
class="j">“I don’t have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you
dishonor me. <script type="text/javascript">cj(8,50);</script>But I
don’t seek my own glory. There is one who seeks and judges. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,51);</script>Most certainly, I tell you, if a
person keeps my word, he will never see death.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,52);</script>Then the Jews said to
him, “Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets;
and you say, <span class="j">‘If a man keeps my word, he will never
taste of death.’</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,53);</script>Are you greater than our father,
Abraham, who died? The prophets died. Who do you make yourself out to
be?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,54);</script>Jesus answered, <span
class="j">“If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who
glorifies me, of whom you say that he is our God. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,55);</script>You have not known him, but I
know him. If I said, ‘I don’t know him,’ I would be like you, a
liar. But I know him, and keep his word. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,56);</script>Your father Abraham rejoiced to
see my day. He saw it, and was glad.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,57);</script>The Jews therefore
said to him, “You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen
Abraham?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,58);</script>Jesus said to them,
<span class="j">“Most certainly, I tell you, before Abraham came into
existence, <a href="#N27">I AM.</a>”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,59);</script>Therefore they took up
stones to throw at him, but Jesus was hidden, and went out of the temple,
having gone through their midst, and so passed by.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,1);</script>As he passed by, he saw
a man blind from birth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,2);</script>His disciples asked him, “Rabbi,
who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,3);</script>Jesus answered, <span
class="j">“Neither did this man sin, nor his parents; but, that the
works of God might be revealed in him. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(9,4);</script>I must work the works of him who
sent me, while it is day. The night is coming, when no one can work.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(9,5);</script>While I am in the world, I
am the light of the world.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,6);</script>When he had said this, he spat on
the ground, made mud with the saliva, anointed the blind man’s eyes with
the mud, <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,7);</script>and said to him,
<span class="j">“Go, wash in the pool of Siloam”</span> (which means
“Sent”). So he went away, washed, and came back seeing. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,8);</script>The neighbors therefore, and those
who saw that he was blind before, said, “Isn’t this he who sat and
begged?” <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,9);</script>Others were
saying, “It is he.” Still others were saying, “He looks like him.”
<p>He said, “I am he.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,10);</script>They therefore were asking him,
“How were your eyes opened?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,11);</script>He answered, “A man
called Jesus made mud, anointed my eyes, and said to me, <span
class="j">‘Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash.’</span> So I went away
and washed, and I received sight.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,12);</script>Then they asked him,
“Where is he?”
<p>He said, “I don’t know.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,13);</script>They brought him who
had been blind to the Pharisees. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,14);</script>It was a Sabbath when Jesus made
the mud and opened his eyes. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,15);</script>Again therefore the Pharisees
also asked him how he received his sight. He said to them, “He put mud
on my eyes, I washed, and I see.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,16);</script>Some therefore of the
Pharisees said, “This man is not from God, because he doesn’t keep the
Sabbath.” Others said, “How can a man who is a sinner do such
signs?” There was division among them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,17);</script>Therefore they asked the blind
man again, “What do you say about him, because he opened your eyes?”
<p>He said, “He is a prophet.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,18);</script>The Jews therefore did
not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his
sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,19);</script>and asked them, “Is
this your son, whom you say was born blind? How then does he now see?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,20);</script>His parents answered
them, “We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,21);</script>but how he now sees, we don’t
know; or who opened his eyes, we don’t know. He is of age. Ask him. He
will speak for himself.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,22);</script>His parents said these things
because they feared the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if any
man would confess him as Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,23);</script>Therefore his parents
said, “He is of age. Ask him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,24);</script>So they called the man
who was blind a second time, and said to him, “Give glory to God. We
know that this man is a sinner.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,25);</script>He therefore answered,
“I don’t know if he is a sinner. One thing I do know: that though I
was blind, now I see.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,26);</script>They said to him
again, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,27);</script>He answered them, “I
told you already, and you didn’t listen. Why do you want to hear it
again? You don’t also want to become his disciples, do you?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,28);</script>They insulted him and
said, “You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,29);</script>We know that God has spoken to
Moses. But as for this man, we don’t know where he comes from.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,30);</script>The man answered them,
“How amazing! You don’t know where he comes from, yet he opened my
eyes. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,31);</script>We know that God
doesn’t listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshipper of God, and
does his will, he listens to him.<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a

type="text/javascript">cb(9,32);</script>Since the world began it has
never been heard of that anyone opened the eyes of someone born blind.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,33);</script>If this man were not from
God, he could do nothing.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,34);</script>They answered him,
“You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us?” They threw
him out.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,35);</script>Jesus heard that they
had thrown him out, and finding him, he said, <span class="j">“Do you
believe in the Son of God?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,36);</script>He answered, “Who is
he, Lord, that I may believe in him?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,37);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“You have both seen him, and it is he who speaks with
you.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,38);</script>He said, “Lord, I
believe!” and he worshiped him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,39);</script>Jesus said, <span
class="j">“I came into this world for judgment, that those who don’t
see may see; and that those who see may become blind.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,40);</script>Those of the Pharisees
who were with him heard these things, and said to him, “Are we also
blind?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,41);</script>Jesus said to them,
<span class="j">“If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you
say, ‘We see.’ Therefore your sin remains.</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,1);</script><span
class="j">“Most certainly, I tell you, one who doesn’t enter by the
door into the sheep fold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a
thief and a robber. <script type="text/javascript">cj(10,2);</script>But
one who enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. <script

him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name,

sheep, and flees. The wolf snatches the sheep, and scatters them. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,13);</script>The hired hand flees because he
is a hired hand, and doesn’t care for the sheep. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,14);</script>I am the good shepherd. I know
my own, and I’m known by my own; <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,15);</script>even as the Father knows me, and
I know the Father. I lay down my life for the sheep. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,16);</script>I have other sheep, which are
not of this fold.<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a

my voice. They will become one flock with one shepherd. <script

type="text/javascript">cj(10,18);</script>No one takes it away from me,
but I lay it down by myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power
to take it again. I received this commandment from my Father.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,19);</script>Therefore a division
arose again among the Jews because of these words. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,20);</script>Many of them said, “He has a
demon, and is insane! Why do you listen to him?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,21);</script>Others said, “These are not
the sayings of one possessed by a demon. It isn’t possible for a demon
to open the eyes of the blind, is it?”<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N32">*</a></sup></font>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,22);</script>It was the <a
href="#N33">Feast of the Dedication</a> at Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,23);</script>It was winter, and Jesus was
walking in the temple, in Solomon’s porch. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,24);</script>The Jews therefore came around
him and said to him, “How long will you hold us in suspense? If you are
the Christ, tell us plainly.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,25);</script>Jesus answered them,
<span class="j">“I told you, and you don’t believe. The works that I
do in my Father’s name, these testify about me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,26);</script>But you don’t believe, because
you are not of my sheep, as I told you. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,27);</script>My sheep hear my voice, and I
know them, and they follow me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,28);</script>I give eternal life to them.
They will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(10,29);</script>My Father, who has given
them to me, is greater than all. No one is able to snatch them out of my
Father’s hand. <script type="text/javascript">cj(10,30);</script>I and
the Father are one.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,31);</script>Therefore Jews took
up stones again to stone him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,32);</script>Jesus answered them, <span
class="j">“I have shown you many good works from my Father. For which of
those works do you stone me?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,33);</script>The Jews answered
him, “We don’t stone you for a good work, but for blasphemy: because
you, being a man, make yourself God.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,34);</script>Jesus answered them,
<span class="j">“Isn’t it written in your law, ‘I said, you are
gods?’<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N34">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,35);</script>If he called them gods, to whom
the word of God came (and the Scripture can’t be broken), <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,36);</script>do you say of him whom the
Father sanctified and sent into the world, ‘You blaspheme,’ because I
said, ‘I am the Son of God?’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,37);</script>If I don’t do the works of my
Father, don’t believe me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,38);</script>But if I do them, though you
don’t believe me, believe the works; that you may know and believe that
the Father is in me, and I in the Father.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,39);</script>They sought again to
seize him, and he went out of their hand. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,40);</script>He went away again beyond the
Jordan into the place where John was baptizing at first, and there he
stayed. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,41);</script>Many came to
him. They said, “John indeed did no sign, but everything that John said
about this man is true.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,42);</script>Many believed in him there.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,1);</script>Now a certain man was
sick, Lazarus from Bethany, of the village of Mary and her sister, Martha.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,2);</script>It was that Mary who had
anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose
brother, Lazarus, was sick. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,3);</script>The sisters therefore sent to
him, saying, “Lord, behold, he for whom you have great affection is
sick.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,4);</script>But when Jesus
heard it, he said, <span class="j">“This sickness is not to death, but
for the glory of God, that God’s Son may be glorified by it.”</span>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,5);</script>Now Jesus loved Martha,
and her sister, and Lazarus. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,6);</script>When therefore he heard that he
was sick, he stayed two days in the place where he was. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,7);</script>Then after this he said to the
disciples, <span class="j">“Let’s go into Judea again.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,8);</script>The disciples told
him, “Rabbi, the Jews were just trying to stone you, and are you going
there again?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,9);</script>Jesus answered, <span
class="j">“Aren’t there twelve hours of daylight? If a man walks in
the day, he doesn’t stumble, because he sees the light of this world.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(11,10);</script>But if a man walks in
the night, he stumbles, because the light isn’t in him.”</span>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,11);</script>He said these things,
and after that, he said to them, <span class="j">“Our friend, Lazarus,
has fallen asleep, but I am going so that I may awake him out of
sleep.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,12);</script>The disciples
therefore said, “Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,13);</script>Now Jesus had spoken
of his death, but they thought that he spoke of taking rest in sleep.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,14);</script>So Jesus said to them
plainly then, <span class="j">“Lazarus is dead. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,15);</script>I am glad for your sakes that I
was not there, so that you may believe. Nevertheless, let’s go to
him.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,16);</script>Thomas therefore, who
is called <a href="#N35">Didymus,</a> said to his fellow disciples,
“Let’s go also, that we may die with him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,17);</script>So when Jesus came,
he found that he had been in the tomb four days already. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,18);</script>Now Bethany was near Jerusalem,
about <a href="#N36">fifteen stadia</a> away. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,19);</script>Many of the Jews had joined the
women around Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,20);</script>Then when Martha heard
that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, but Mary stayed in the house.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,21);</script>Therefore Martha said to
Jesus, “Lord, if you would have been here, my brother wouldn’t have
died. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,22);</script>Even now I know
that, whatever you ask of God, God will give you.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,23);</script>Jesus said to her, <span
class="j">“Your brother will rise again.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,24);</script>Martha said to him,
“I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,25);</script>Jesus said to her,
<span class="j">“I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in
me will still live, even if he dies. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,26);</script>Whoever lives and believes in me
will never die. Do you believe this?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,27);</script>She said to him,
“Yes, Lord. I have come to believe that you are the Christ, God’s Son,
he who comes into the world.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,28);</script>When she had said
this, she went away, and called Mary, her sister, secretly, saying, “The
Teacher is here, and is calling you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,29);</script>When she heard this,
she arose quickly, and went to him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,30);</script>Now Jesus had not yet come into
the village, but was in the place where Martha met him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,31);</script>Then the Jews who were with her
in the house, and were consoling her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up
quickly and went out, followed her, saying, “She is going to the tomb to
weep there.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,32);</script>Therefore
when Mary came to where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet,
saying to him, “Lord, if you would have been here, my brother wouldn’t
have died.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,33);</script>When Jesus therefore
saw her weeping, and the Jews weeping who came with her, he groaned in the
spirit, and was troubled, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,34);</script>and said, <span
class="j">“Where have you laid him?”</span>
<p>They told him, “Lord, come and see.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,35);</script>Jesus wept.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,36);</script>The Jews therefore
said, “See how much affection he had for him!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,37);</script>Some of them said, “Couldn’t
this man, who opened the eyes of him who was blind, have also kept this
man from dying?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,38);</script>Jesus therefore,
again groaning in himself, came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a
stone lay against it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,39);</script>Jesus said, <span
class="j">“Take away the stone.”</span>
<p>Martha, the sister of him who was dead, said to him, “Lord, by this
time there is a stench, for he has been dead four days.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,40);</script>Jesus said to her,
<span class="j">“Didn’t I tell you that if you believed, you would see
God’s glory?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,41);</script>So they took away the
stone <a href="#N37">from the place where the dead man was lying.</a>
Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, <span class="j">“Father, I thank you
that you listened to me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,42);</script>I know that you always listen to
me, but because of the multitude that stands around I said this, that they
may believe that you sent me.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,43);</script>When he had said this, he cried
with a loud voice, <span class="j">“Lazarus, come out!”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,44);</script>He who was dead came
out, bound hand and foot with wrappings, and his face was wrapped around
with a cloth.
<p>Jesus said to them, <span class="j">“Free him, and let him
go.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,45);</script>Therefore many of the
Jews, who came to Mary and saw what Jesus did, believed in him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,46);</script>But some of them went away to
the Pharisees, and told them the things which Jesus had done. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,47);</script>The chief priests therefore and
the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, “What are we doing? For this
man does many signs. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,48);</script>If
we leave him alone like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans
will come and take away both our place and our nation.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,49);</script>But a certain one of
them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, “You know
nothing at all, <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,50);</script>nor do
you consider that it is advantageous for us that one man should die for
the people, and that the whole nation not perish.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,51);</script>Now he didn’t say this of
himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus would
die for the nation, <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,52);</script>and
not for the nation only, but that he might also gather together into one
the children of God who are scattered abroad. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,53);</script>So from that day forward they
took counsel that they might put him to death. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,54);</script>Jesus therefore walked no more
openly among the Jews, but departed from there into the country near the
wilderness, to a city called Ephraim. He stayed there with his disciples.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,55);</script>Now the Passover of
the Jews was at hand. Many went up from the country to Jerusalem before
the Passover, to purify themselves. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,56);</script>Then they sought for Jesus and
spoke one with another, as they stood in the temple, “What do you
think—that he isn’t coming to the feast at all?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,57);</script>Now the chief priests and the
Pharisees had commanded that if anyone knew where he was, he should report
it, that they might seize him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,1);</script>Then six days before
the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, who had been dead,
whom he raised from the dead. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,2);</script>So they made him a supper there.
Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with him.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(12,3);</script>Mary, therefore, took a
<a href="#N38">pound</a> of ointment of pure nard, very precious, and
anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair. The house
was filled with the fragrance of the ointment. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,4);</script>Then Judas Iscariot, Simon’s
son, one of his disciples, who would betray him, said, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,5);</script>“Why wasn’t this ointment
sold for <a href="#N39">three hundred denarii,</a> and given to the
poor?” <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,6);</script>Now he said
this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and
having the money box, used to steal what was put into it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,7);</script>But Jesus said, <span
class="j">“Leave her alone. She has kept this for the day of my burial.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(12,8);</script>For you always have the
poor with you, but you don’t always have me.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,9);</script>A large crowd
therefore of the Jews learned that he was there, and they came, not for
Jesus’ sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had
raised from the dead. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,10);</script>But the chief priests conspired
to put Lazarus to death also, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,11);</script>because on account of him many
of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,12);</script>On the next day a
great multitude had come to the feast. When they heard that Jesus was
coming to Jerusalem, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,13);</script>they took the branches of the
palm trees, and went out to meet him, and cried out, “<a
href="#N40">Hosanna</a>! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the
Lord,<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N41">*</a></sup></font>
the King of Israel!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,14);</script>Jesus, having found a
young donkey, sat on it. As it is written, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,15);</script>“Don’t be afraid, daughter
of Zion. Behold, your King comes, sitting on a donkey’s colt.”<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N42">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,16);</script>His disciples didn’t
understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they
remembered that these things were written about him, and that they had
done these things to him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,17);</script>The multitude therefore that was
with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the
dead, was testifying about it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,18);</script>For this cause also the
multitude went and met him, because they heard that he had done this sign.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(12,19);</script>The Pharisees therefore
said among themselves, “See how you accomplish nothing. Behold, the
world has gone after him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,20);</script>Now there were
certain Greeks among those that went up to worship at the feast. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,21);</script>These, therefore, came to
Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, “Sir,
we want to see Jesus.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,22);</script>Philip came and told Andrew, and
in turn, Andrew came with Philip, and they told Jesus. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,23);</script>Jesus answered them, <span
class="j">“The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,24);</script>Most certainly I tell you,
unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains by
itself alone. But if it dies, it bears much fruit. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,25);</script>He who loves his life will lose
it. He who hates his life in this world will keep it to eternal life.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(12,26);</script>If anyone serves me, let
him follow me. Where I am, there will my servant also be. If anyone serves
me, the Father will honor him.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,27);</script>“Now my soul is troubled. What
shall I say? ‘Father, save me from this time?’ But for this cause I
came to this time. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,28);</script>Father, glorify your
name!”</span>
<p>Then there came a voice out of the sky, saying, “I have both
glorified it, and will glorify it again.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,29);</script>The multitude
therefore, who stood by and heard it, said that it had thundered. Others
said, “An angel has spoken to him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,30);</script>Jesus answered, <span
class="j">“This voice hasn’t come for my sake, but for your sakes.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(12,31);</script>Now is the judgment of
this world. Now the prince of this world will be cast out. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,32);</script>And I, if I am lifted up from
the earth, will draw all people to myself.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,33);</script>But he said this, signifying by
what kind of death he should die. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,34);</script>The multitude answered him,
“We have heard out of the law that the Christ remains forever.<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N43">*</a></sup></font> How do you
say, <span class="j">‘The Son of Man must be lifted up?’</span> Who is
this Son of Man?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,35);</script>Jesus therefore said
to them, <span class="j">“Yet a little while the light is with you. Walk
while you have the light, that darkness doesn’t overtake you. He who
walks in the darkness doesn’t know where he is going. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,36);</script>While you have the light,
believe in the light, that you may become children of light.”</span>
Jesus said these things, and he departed and hid himself from them.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(12,37);</script>But though he had done
so many signs before them, yet they didn’t believe in him, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,38);</script>that the word of Isaiah the
prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke,
<dl>
<dt>“Lord, who has believed our report?
<dd>To whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N44">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,39);</script>For this cause they
couldn’t believe, for Isaiah said again,
<dl>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,40);</script>“He has blinded
their eyes and he hardened their heart,
<dd>lest they should see with their eyes,
<dd>and perceive with their heart,
<dd>and would turn,
<dd>and I would heal them.”<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N45">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,41);</script>Isaiah said these
things when he saw his glory, and spoke of him.<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N46">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,42);</script>Nevertheless even of the rulers
many believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they didn’t confess
it, so that they wouldn’t be put out of the synagogue, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,43);</script>for they loved men’s praise
more than God’s praise.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,44);</script>Jesus cried out and
said, <span class="j">“Whoever believes in me, believes not in me, but
in him who sent me. <script type="text/javascript">cj(12,45);</script>He
who sees me sees him who sent me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,46);</script>I have come as a light into the
world, that whoever believes in me may not remain in the darkness. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,47);</script>If anyone listens to my sayings,
and doesn’t believe, I don’t judge him. For I came not to judge the
world, but to save the world. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,48);</script>He who rejects me, and doesn’t
receive my sayings, has one who judges him. The word that I spoke, the
same will judge him in the last day. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,49);</script>For I spoke not from myself, but
the Father who sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and
what I should speak. <script type="text/javascript">cj(12,50);</script>I
know that his commandment is eternal life. The things therefore which I
speak, even as the Father has said to me, so I speak.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,1);</script>Now before the feast
of the Passover, Jesus, knowing that his time had come that he would
depart from this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the
world, he loved them to the end. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,2);</script>During supper, the devil having
already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, to betray
him, <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,3);</script>Jesus, knowing that
the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he came forth
from God, and was going to God, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,4);</script>arose from supper, and laid aside
his outer garments. He took a towel, and wrapped a towel around his waist.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,5);</script>Then he poured water into
the basin, and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe them with
the towel that was wrapped around him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,6);</script>Then he came to Simon Peter. He
said to him, “Lord, do you wash my feet?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,7);</script>Jesus answered him,
<span class="j">“You don’t know what I am doing now, but you will

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,8);</script>Peter said to him,
“You will never wash my feet!”
<p>Jesus answered him, <span class="j">“If I don’t wash you, you have
no part with me.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,9);</script>Simon Peter said to
him, “Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,10);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“Someone who has bathed only needs to have his feet
washed, but is completely clean. You are clean, but not all of
you.”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,11);</script>For he
knew him who would betray him, therefore he said, <span class="j">“You
are not all clean.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,12);</script>So when he had washed their
feet, put his outer garment back on, and sat down again, he said to them,
<span class="j">“Do you know what I have done to you? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,13);</script>You call me, ‘Teacher’ and
‘Lord.’ You say so correctly, for so I am. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,14);</script>If I then, the Lord and the
Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s
feet. <script type="text/javascript">cj(13,15);</script>For I have given
you an example, that you also should do as I have done to you. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,16);</script>Most certainly I tell you, a
servant is not greater than his lord, neither one who is sent greater than
he who sent him. <script type="text/javascript">cj(13,17);</script>If you
know these things, blessed are you if you do them. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,18);</script>I don’t speak concerning all
of you. I know whom I have chosen. But that the Scripture may be
fulfilled, ‘He who eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against
me.’<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N47">*</a></sup></font>
<script type="text/javascript">cj(13,19);</script>From now on, I tell you
before it happens, that when it happens, you may believe that I am he.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(13,20);</script>Most certainly I tell
you, he who receives whomever I send, receives me; and he who receives me,
receives him who sent me.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,21);</script>When Jesus had said
this, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, <span class="j">“Most
certainly I tell you that one of you will betray me.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,22);</script>The disciples looked
at one another, perplexed about whom he spoke. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,23);</script>One of his disciples, whom Jesus
loved, was at the table, leaning against Jesus’ breast. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,24);</script>Simon Peter therefore beckoned
to him, and said to him, “Tell us who it is of whom he speaks.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,25);</script>He, leaning back, as
he was, on Jesus’ breast, asked him, “Lord, who is it?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,26);</script>Jesus therefore
answered, <span class="j">“It is he to whom I will give this piece of
bread when I have dipped it.”</span> So when he had dipped the piece of
bread, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,27);</script>After the piece of bread, then
Satan entered into him.
<p>Then Jesus said to him, <span class="j">“What you do, do
quickly.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,28);</script>Now no man at the
table knew why he said this to him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,29);</script>For some thought, because Judas
had the money box, that Jesus said to him, “Buy what things we need for
the feast,” or that he should give something to the poor. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,30);</script>Therefore having received that
morsel, he went out immediately. It was night.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,31);</script>When he had gone out,
Jesus said, <span class="j">“Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and
God has been glorified in him. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,32);</script>If God has been glorified in
him, God will also glorify him in himself, and he will glorify him
immediately. <script type="text/javascript">cj(13,33);</script>Little
children, I will be with you a little while longer. You will seek me, and
as I said to the Jews, ‘Where I am going, you can’t come,’ so now I
tell you. <script type="text/javascript">cj(13,34);</script>A new
commandment I give to you, that you love one another, just like I have
loved you; that you also love one another. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,35);</script>By this everyone will know that
you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,36);</script>Simon Peter said to
him, “Lord, where are you going?”
<p>Jesus answered, <span class="j">“Where I am going, you can’t follow
now, but you will follow afterwards.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,37);</script>Peter said to him,
“Lord, why can’t I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,38);</script>Jesus answered him,
<span class="j">“Will you lay down your life for me? Most certainly I
tell you, the rooster won’t crow until you have denied me three
times.</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,1);</script><span

also in me. <script type="text/javascript">cj(14,2);</script>In my

you. I am going to prepare a place for you. <script

you, I will come again, and will receive you to myself; that where I am,
you may be there also. <script

know the way.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,5);</script>Thomas said to him,
“Lord, we don’t know where you are going. How can we know the way?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,6);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to
the Father, except through me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,7);</script>If you had known me, you would
have known my Father also. From now on, you know him, and have seen
him.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,8);</script>Philip said to him,
“Lord, show us the Father, and that will be enough for us.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,9);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“Have I been with you such a long time, and do you not
know me, Philip? He who has seen me has seen the Father. How do you say,
‘Show us the Father?’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,10);</script>Don’t you believe that I am in
the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I tell you, I speak not
from myself; but the Father who lives in me does his works. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,11);</script>Believe me that I am in the
Father, and the Father in me; or else believe me for the very works’
sake. <script type="text/javascript">cj(14,12);</script>Most certainly I
tell you, he who believes in me, the works that I do, he will do also; and
he will do greater works than these, because I am going to my Father.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(14,13);</script>Whatever you will ask in
my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(14,14);</script>If you will ask anything
in my name, I will do it. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,15);</script>If you love me, keep my
commandments. <script type="text/javascript">cj(14,16);</script>I will
pray to the Father, and he will give you another <a

world can’t receive; for it doesn’t see him, neither knows him. You
know him, for he lives with you, and will be in you. <script

will come to you. <script type="text/javascript">cj(14,19);</script>Yet a

keeps them, that person is one who loves me. One who loves me will be
loved by my Father, and I will love him, and will reveal myself to
him.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,22);</script>Judas (not Iscariot)
said to him, “Lord, what has happened that you are about to reveal
yourself to us, and not to the world?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,23);</script>Jesus answered him,
<span class="j">“If a man loves me, he will keep my word. My Father will
love him, and we will come to him, and make our home with him. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,24);</script>He who doesn’t love me
doesn’t keep my words. The word which you hear isn’t mine, but the
Father’s who sent me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,25);</script>I have said these things to you,
while still living with you. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,26);</script>But the Counselor, the Holy
Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all
things, and will remind you of all that I said to you. <script

I give to you; not as the world gives, give I to you. Don’t let your
heart be troubled, neither let it be fearful. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,28);</script>You heard how I told you, ‘I
go away, and I come to you.’ If you loved me, you would have rejoiced,
because I said ‘I am going to my Father;’ for the Father is greater
than I. <script type="text/javascript">cj(14,29);</script>Now I have told
you before it happens so that, when it happens, you may believe. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,30);</script>I will no more speak much with
you, for the prince of the world comes, and he has nothing in me. <script

that the world may believe that you sent me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(17,22);</script>The glory which you have given
me, I have given to them; that they may be one, even as we are one;
<script type="text/javascript">cj(17,23);</script>I in them, and you in
me, that they may be perfected into one; that the world may know that you
sent me, and loved them, even as you loved me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(17,24);</script>Father, I desire that they also
whom you have given me be with me where I am, that they may see my glory,
which you have given me, for you loved me before the foundation of the
world. <script type="text/javascript">cj(17,25);</script>Righteous Father,
the world hasn’t known you, but I knew you; and these knew that you sent
me. <script type="text/javascript">cj(17,26);</script>I made known to them
your name, and will make it known; that the love with which you loved me
may be in them, and I in them.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,1);</script>When Jesus had spoken
these words, he went out with his disciples over the brook Kidron, where
there was a garden, into which he and his disciples entered. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,2);</script>Now Judas, who betrayed him, also
knew the place, for Jesus often met there with his disciples. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,3);</script>Judas then, having taken a
detachment of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and the
Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,4);</script>Jesus therefore, knowing all the
things that were happening to him, went forth, and said to them, <span
class="j">“Who are you looking for?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,5);</script>They answered him,
“Jesus of Nazareth.”
<p>Jesus said to them, <span class="j">“I am he.”</span>
<p>Judas also, who betrayed him, was standing with them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,6);</script>When therefore he said to them,
<span class="j">“I am he,”</span> they went backward, and fell to the
ground.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,7);</script>Again therefore he
asked them, <span class="j">“Who are you looking for?”</span>
<p>They said, “Jesus of Nazareth.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,8);</script>Jesus answered, <span
class="j">“I told you that I am he. If therefore you seek me, let these
go their way,”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,9);</script>that the word might be fulfilled
which he spoke, <span class="j">“Of those whom you have given me, I have
lost none.”</span><font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N55">*</a></sup></font>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,10);</script>Simon Peter
therefore, having a sword, drew it, and struck the high priest’s
servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,11);</script>Jesus therefore said to
Peter, <span class="j">“Put the sword into its sheath. The cup which the
Father has given me, shall I not surely drink it?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,12);</script>So the detachment,
the commanding officer, and the officers of the Jews, seized Jesus and
bound him, <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,13);</script>and led him
to Annas first, for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was high priest
that year. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,14);</script>Now it was
Caiaphas who advised the Jews that it was expedient that one man should
perish for the people. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,15);</script>Simon Peter followed Jesus, as
did another disciple. Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and
entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,16);</script>but Peter was standing at the
door outside. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest,
went out and spoke to her who kept the door, and brought in Peter. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,17);</script>Then the maid who kept the door
said to Peter, “Are you also one of this man’s disciples?”
<p>He said, “I am not.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,18);</script>Now the servants and
the officers were standing there, having made a fire of coals, for it was
cold. They were warming themselves. Peter was with them, standing and
warming himself. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,19);</script>The
high priest therefore asked Jesus about his disciples, and about his
teaching. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,20);</script>Jesus answered
him, <span class="j">“I spoke openly to the world. I always taught in
synagogues, and in the temple, where the Jews always meet. I said nothing
in secret. <script type="text/javascript">cj(18,21);</script>Why do you
ask me? Ask those who have heard me what I said to them. Behold, these
know the things which I said.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,22);</script>When he had said
this, one of the officers standing by slapped Jesus with his hand, saying,
“Do you answer the high priest like that?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,23);</script>Jesus answered him,
<span class="j">“If I have spoken evil, testify of the evil; but if
well, why do you beat me?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,24);</script>Annas sent him bound
to Caiaphas, the high priest. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,25);</script>Now Simon Peter was standing and
warming himself. They said therefore to him, “You aren’t also one of
his disciples, are you?”
<p>He denied it, and said, “I am not.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,26);</script>One of the servants
of the high priest, being a relative of him whose ear Peter had cut off,
said, “Didn’t I see you in the garden with him?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,27);</script>Peter therefore
denied it again, and immediately the rooster crowed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,28);</script>They led Jesus
therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium. It was early, and they
themselves didn’t enter into the Praetorium, that they might not be
defiled, but might eat the Passover. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,29);</script>Pilate therefore went out to
them, and said, “What accusation do you bring against this man?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,30);</script>They answered him,
“If this man weren’t an evildoer, we wouldn’t have delivered him up
to you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,31);</script>Pilate therefore said
to them, “Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law.”
<p>Therefore the Jews said to him, “It is not lawful for us to put
anyone to death,” <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,32);</script>that
the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying by what
kind of death he should die.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,33);</script>Pilate therefore
entered again into the Praetorium, called Jesus, and said to him, “Are
you the King of the Jews?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,34);</script>Jesus answered him,
<span class="j">“Do you say this by yourself, or did others tell you
about me?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,35);</script>Pilate answered,
“I’m not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests delivered
you to me. What have you done?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,36);</script>Jesus answered, <span
class="j">“My Kingdom is not of this world. If my Kingdom were of this
world, then my servants would fight, that I wouldn’t be delivered to the
Jews. But now my Kingdom is not from here.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,37);</script>Pilate therefore said
to him, “Are you a king then?”
<p>Jesus answered, <span class="j">“You say that I am a king. For this
reason I have been born, and for this reason I have come into the world,
that I should testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens
to my voice.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,38);</script>Pilate said to him,
“What is truth?”
<p>When he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and said to them,
“I find no basis for a charge against him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,39);</script>But you have a custom, that I
should release someone to you at the Passover. Therefore do you want me to
release to you the King of the Jews?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,40);</script>Then they all shouted
again, saying, “Not this man, but Barabbas!” Now Barabbas was a robber.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,1);</script>So Pilate then took
Jesus, and flogged him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,2);</script>The soldiers twisted thorns into
a crown, and put it on his head, and dressed him in a purple garment.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(19,3);</script>They kept saying,
“Hail, King of the Jews!” and they kept slapping him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,4);</script>Then Pilate went out
again, and said to them, “Behold, I bring him out to you, that you may
know that I find no basis for a charge against him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,5);</script>Jesus therefore came
out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. Pilate said to
them, “Behold, the man!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,6);</script>When therefore the
chief priests and the officers saw him, they shouted, saying, “Crucify!
Crucify!”
<p>Pilate said to them, “Take him yourselves, and crucify him, for I
find no basis for a charge against him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,7);</script>The Jews answered him,
“We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself
the Son of God.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,8);</script>When therefore Pilate
heard this saying, he was more afraid. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,9);</script>He entered into the Praetorium
again, and said to Jesus, “Where are you from?” But Jesus gave him no
answer. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,10);</script>Pilate therefore
said to him, “Aren’t you speaking to me? Don’t you know that I have
power to release you, and have power to crucify you?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,11);</script>Jesus answered, <span
class="j">“You would have no power at all against me, unless it were
given to you from above. Therefore he who delivered me to you has greater
sin.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,12);</script>At this, Pilate was
seeking to release him, but the Jews cried out, saying, “If you release
this man, you aren’t Caesar’s friend! Everyone who makes himself a
king speaks against Caesar!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,13);</script>When Pilate therefore
heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment seat
at a place called “The Pavement,” but in Hebrew, “Gabbatha.”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(19,14);</script>Now it was the
Preparation Day of the Passover, at about <a href="#N56">the sixth
hour.</a> He said to the Jews, “Behold, your King!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,15);</script>They cried out,
“Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!”
<p>Pilate said to them, “Shall I crucify your King?”
<p>The chief priests answered, “We have no king but Caesar!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,16);</script>So then he delivered
him to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus and led him away. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,17);</script>He went out, bearing his cross,
to the place called “The Place of a Skull,” which is called in Hebrew,
“Golgotha,” <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,18);</script>where
they crucified him, and with him two others, on either side one, and Jesus
in the middle. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,19);</script>Pilate
wrote a title also, and put it on the cross. There was written, “JESUS
OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,20);</script>Therefore many of the Jews read
this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and
it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,21);</script>The chief priests of the Jews
therefore said to Pilate, “Don’t write, ‘The King of the Jews,’
but, ‘he said, I am King of the Jews.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,22);</script>Pilate answered,
“What I have written, I have written.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,23);</script>Then the soldiers,
when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to
every soldier a part; and also the coat. Now the coat was without seam,
woven from the top throughout. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,24);</script>Then they said to one another,
“Let’s not tear it, but cast lots for it to decide whose it will
be,” that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which says,
<dl>
<dt>“They parted my garments among them.
<dd>For my cloak they cast lots.”<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N57">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p>Therefore the soldiers did these things. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,25);</script>But there were standing by the
cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of
Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,26);</script>Therefore when Jesus saw his
mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he said to his
mother, <span class="j">“Woman, behold your son!”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,27);</script>Then he said to the disciple,
<span class="j">“Behold, your mother!”</span> From that hour, the
disciple took her to his own home.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,28);</script>After this, Jesus, <a
href="#N58">seeing</a> that all things were now finished, that the
Scripture might be fulfilled, said, <span class="j">“I am
thirsty.”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,29);</script>Now a
vessel full of vinegar was set there; so they put a sponge full of the
vinegar on hyssop, and held it at his mouth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,30);</script>When Jesus therefore had
received the vinegar, he said, <span class="j">“It is
finished.”</span> He bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,31);</script>Therefore the Jews,
because it was the Preparation Day, so that the bodies wouldn’t remain
on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a special one), asked of
Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(19,32);</script>Therefore the soldiers
came, and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified
with him; <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,33);</script>but when they
came to Jesus, and saw that he was already dead, they didn’t break his
legs. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,34);</script>However one of the
soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water
came out. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,35);</script>He who has
seen has testified, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the
truth, that you may believe. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,36);</script>For these things happened, that
the Scripture might be fulfilled, “A bone of him will not be
broken.”<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N59">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,37);</script>Again another Scripture says,
“They will look on him whom they pierced.”<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N60">*</a></sup></font>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,38);</script>After these things,
Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of
the Jews, asked of Pilate that he might take away Jesus’ body. Pilate
gave him permission. He came therefore and took away his body. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,39);</script>Nicodemus, who at first came to
Jesus by night, also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about <a
href="#N61">a hundred Roman pounds.</a> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,40);</script>So they took Jesus’ body, and
bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to
bury. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,41);</script>Now in the place
where he was crucified there was a garden. In the garden was a new tomb in
which no man had ever yet been laid. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,42);</script>Then because of the Jews’
Preparation Day (for the tomb was near at hand) they laid Jesus there.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,1);</script>Now on the first day
of the week, Mary Magdalene went early, while it was still dark, to the
tomb, and saw the stone taken away from the tomb. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,2);</script>Therefore she ran and came to
Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them,
“They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we don’t know
where they have laid him!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,3);</script>Therefore Peter and
the other disciple went out, and they went toward the tomb. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,4);</script>They both ran together. The other
disciple outran Peter, and came to the tomb first. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,5);</script>Stooping and looking in, he saw
the linen cloths lying, yet he didn’t enter in. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,6);</script>Then Simon Peter came, following
him, and entered into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,7);</script>and the cloth that had been on
his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by
itself. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,8);</script>So then the other
disciple who came first to the tomb also entered in, and he saw and
believed. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,9);</script>For as yet they
didn’t know the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,10);</script>So the disciples went away again
to their own homes.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,11);</script>But Mary was standing
outside at the tomb weeping. So, as she wept, she stooped and looked into
the tomb, <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,12);</script>and she saw
two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where
the body of Jesus had lain. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,13);</script>They told her, “Woman, why are
you weeping?”
<p>She said to them, “Because they have taken away my Lord, and I
don’t know where they have laid him.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,14);</script>When she had said this, she
turned around and saw Jesus standing, and didn’t know that it was Jesus.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,15);</script>Jesus said to her,
<span class="j">“Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking
for?”</span>
<p>She, supposing him to be the gardener, said to him, “Sir, if you have
carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him
away.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,16);</script>Jesus said to her,
<span class="j">“Mary.”</span>
<p>She turned and said to him, “<a href="#N62">Rabboni</a>!” which is
to say, “<a href="#N63">Teacher</a>!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,17);</script>Jesus said to her,
<span class="j">“Don’t hold me, for I haven’t yet ascended to my
Father; but go to my brothers, and tell them, ‘I am ascending to my
Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,18);</script>Mary Magdalene came
and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had said
these things to her. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,19);</script>When therefore it was evening,
on that day, the first day of the week, and when the doors were locked
where the disciples were assembled, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and
stood in the midst, and said to them, <span class="j">“Peace be to
you.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,20);</script>When he had said
this, he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were
glad when they saw the Lord. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,21);</script>Jesus therefore said to them
again, <span class="j">“Peace be to you. As the Father has sent me, even
so I send you.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,22);</script>When he had said this, he
breathed on them, and said to them, <span class="j">“Receive the Holy
Spirit! <script type="text/javascript">cj(20,23);</script>If you forgive
anyone’s sins, they have been forgiven them. If you retain anyone’s
sins, they have been retained.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,24);</script>But Thomas, one of
the twelve, called Didymus, wasn’t with them when Jesus came. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,25);</script>The other disciples therefore
said to him, “We have seen the Lord!”
<p>But he said to them, “Unless I see in his hands the print of the
nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,26);</script>After eight days
again his disciples were inside, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, the
doors being locked, and stood in the midst, and said, <span
class="j">“Peace be to you.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,27);</script>Then he said to Thomas, <span
class="j">“Reach here your finger, and see my hands. Reach here your
hand, and put it into my side. Don’t be unbelieving, but
believing.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,28);</script>Thomas answered him,
“My Lord and my God!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,29);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“Because you have seen me,<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N64">*</a></sup></font> you have believed. Blessed
are those who have not seen, and have believed.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,30);</script>Therefore Jesus did
many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written
in this book; <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,31);</script>but these
are written, that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of
God, and that believing you may have life in his name.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,1);</script>After these things,
Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias. He
revealed himself this way. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,2);</script>Simon Peter, Thomas called
Didymus, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two
others of his disciples were together. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,3);</script>Simon Peter said to them,
“I’m going fishing.”
<p>They told him, “We are also coming with you.” They immediately went
out, and entered into the boat. That night, they caught nothing. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,4);</script>But when day had already come,
Jesus stood on the beach, yet the disciples didn’t know that it was
Jesus. <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,5);</script>Jesus therefore
said to them, <span class="j">“Children, have you anything to
eat?”</span>
<p>They answered him, “No.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,6);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find
some.”</span>
<p>They cast it therefore, and now they weren’t able to draw it in for
the multitude of fish. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,7);</script>That disciple therefore whom
Jesus loved said to Peter, “It’s the Lord!”
<p>So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he wrapped his coat
around him (for he was naked), and threw himself into the sea. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,8);</script>But the other disciples came in
the little boat (for they were not far from the land, but about <a
href="#N65">two hundred cubits</a> away), dragging the net full of fish.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(21,9);</script>So when they got out on
the land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(21,10);</script>Jesus said to them,
<span class="j">“Bring some of the fish which you have just
caught.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,11);</script>Simon Peter went up,
and drew the net to land, full of great fish, one hundred fifty-three; and
even though there were so many, the net wasn’t torn.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,12);</script>Jesus said to them,
<span class="j">“Come and eat breakfast.”</span>
<p>None of the disciples dared inquire of him, “Who are you?” knowing
that it was the Lord.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,13);</script>Then Jesus came and
took the bread, gave it to them, and the fish likewise. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,14);</script>This is now the third time that
Jesus was revealed to his disciples, after he had risen from the dead.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(21,15);</script>So when they had eaten
their breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, <span class="j">“Simon, son
of Jonah, do you love me more than these?”</span>
<p>He said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection for you.”
<p>He said to him, <span class="j">“Feed my lambs.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,16);</script>He said to him again a second
time, <span class="j">“Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me?”</span>
<p>He said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection for you.”
<p>He said to him, <span class="j">“Tend my sheep.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,17);</script>He said to him the third time,
<span class="j">“Simon, son of Jonah, do you have affection for
me?”</span>
<p>Peter was grieved because he asked him the third time, <span
class="j">“Do you have affection for me?”</span> He said to him,
“Lord, you know everything. You know that I have affection for you.”
<p>Jesus said to him, <span class="j">“Feed my sheep. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(21,18);</script>Most certainly I tell you, when
you were young, you dressed yourself, and walked where you wanted to. But
when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress
you, and carry you where you don’t want to go.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,19);</script>Now he said this,
signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God. When he had said
this, he said to him, <span class="j">“Follow me.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,20);</script>Then Peter, turning
around, saw a disciple following. This was the disciple whom Jesus
sincerely loved, the one who had also leaned on Jesus’ breast at the
supper and asked, “Lord, who is going to betray You?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,21);</script>Peter seeing him, said to Jesus,
“Lord, what about this man?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,22);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“If I desire that he stay until I come, what is that to
you? You follow me.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,23);</script>This saying therefore went out
among the <a href="#N66">brothers</a>, that this disciple wouldn’t die.
Yet Jesus didn’t say to him that he wouldn’t die, but, <span
class="j">“If I desire that he stay until I come, what is that to
you?”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,24);</script>This is
the disciple who testifies about these things, and wrote these things. We
know that his witness is true. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,25);</script>There are also many other things
which Jesus did, which if they would all be written, I suppose that even
the world itself wouldn’t have room for the books that would be written.
