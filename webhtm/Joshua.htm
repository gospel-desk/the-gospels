Joshua
</h1><p>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,1);</script>Now it happened after the
death of Moses the servant of <a href="#N1">Yahweh,</a> that Yahweh spoke
to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses’ servant, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,2);</script>“Moses my servant is dead; now
therefore arise, go over this Jordan, you, and all this people, to the
land which I give to them, even to the children of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,3);</script>I have given you every place that
the sole of your foot will tread on, as I told Moses. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,4);</script>From the wilderness, and this
Lebanon, even to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the
Hittites, and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be
your border. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,5);</script>No man will
be able to stand before you all the days of your life. As I was with
Moses, so I will be with you. I will not fail you nor forsake you.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,6);</script>“Be strong and
courageous; for you shall cause this people to inherit the land which I
swore to their fathers to give them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,7);</script>Only be strong and very
courageous, to observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my
servant commanded you. Don’t turn from it to the right hand or to the
left, that you may have good success wherever you go. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,8);</script>This book of the law shall not
depart out of your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, that
you may observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then
you shall make your way prosperous, and then you shall have good success.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,9);</script>Haven’t I commanded you?
Be strong and courageous. Don’t be afraid, neither be dismayed: for
Yahweh your <a href="#N2">God</a> is with you wherever you go.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,10);</script>Then Joshua commanded
the officers of the people, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,11);</script>“Pass through the midst of the
camp, and command the people, saying, ‘Prepare food; for within three
days you are to pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which
Yahweh your God gives you to possess it.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,12);</script>Joshua spoke to the
Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, saying,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,13);</script>“Remember the word
which Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded you, saying, ‘Yahweh your
God gives you rest, and will give you this land. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,14);</script>Your wives, your little ones, and
your livestock, shall live in the land which Moses gave you beyond the
Jordan; but you shall pass over before your brothers armed, all the mighty
men of valor, and shall help them <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,15);</script>until Yahweh has given your
brothers rest, as he has given you, and they have also possessed the land
which Yahweh your God gives them. Then you shall return to the land of
your possession, and possess it, which Moses the servant of Yahweh gave
you beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,16);</script>They answered Joshua,
saying, “All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you
send us we will go. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,17);</script>Just
as we listened to Moses in all things, so will we listen to you. Only may
Yahweh your God be with you, as he was with Moses. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,18);</script>Whoever rebels against your
commandment, and doesn’t listen to your words in all that you command
him, he shall be put to death. Only be strong and courageous.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,1);</script>Joshua the son of Nun
secretly sent two men out of Shittim as spies, saying, “Go, view the
land, including Jericho.” They went and came into the house of a
prostitute whose name was Rahab, and slept there.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,2);</script>The king of Jericho was
told, “Behold, men of the children of Israel came in here tonight to spy
out the land.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,3);</script>The king of Jericho
sent to Rahab, saying, “Bring out the men who have come to you, who have
entered into your house; for they have come to spy out all the land.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,4);</script>The woman took the two
men and hid them. Then she said, “Yes, the men came to me, but I
didn’t know where they came from. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,5);</script>It happened about the time of the
shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out. Where the
men went, I don’t know. Pursue them quickly; for you will overtake
them.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,6);</script>But she had
brought them up to the roof, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which
she had laid in order on the roof. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,7);</script>The men pursued them the way to
the Jordan to the fords: and as soon as those who pursued them had gone
out, they shut the gate. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,8);</script>Before they had laid down, she
came up to them on the roof; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,9);</script>and she said to the men, “I know
that Yahweh has given you the land, and that the fear of you has fallen on
us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,10);</script>For we have heard how Yahweh
dried up the water of the <a href="#N3">Red Sea</a> before you, when you
came out of Egypt; and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites, who
were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and to Og, whom you utterly destroyed.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,11);</script>As soon as we had heard
it, our hearts melted, neither did there remain any more spirit in any
man, because of you: for Yahweh your God, he is God in heaven above, and
on earth beneath. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,12);</script>Now
therefore, please swear to me by Yahweh, since I have dealt kindly with
you, that you also will deal kindly with my father’s house, and give me
a true token; <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,13);</script>and that
you will save alive my father, my mother, my brothers, and my sisters, and
all that they have, and will deliver our lives from death.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,14);</script>The men said to her,
“Our life for yours, if you don’t talk about this business of ours;
and it shall be, when Yahweh gives us the land, that we will deal kindly
and truly with you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,15);</script>Then she let them down
by a cord through the window; for her house was on the side of the wall,
and she lived on the wall. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,16);</script>She said to them, “Go to the
mountain, lest the pursuers find you; and hide yourselves there three
days, until the pursuers have returned. Afterward, you may go your way.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,17);</script>The men said to her,
“We will be guiltless of this your oath which you have made us to swear.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,18);</script>Behold, when we come into
the land, you shall bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which
you used to let us down. You shall gather to yourself into the house your
father, your mother, your brothers, and all your father’s household.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,19);</script>It shall be that whoever
goes out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood will be on
his head, and we will be guiltless. Whoever is with you in the house, his
blood shall be on our head, if any hand is on him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,20);</script>But if you talk about this
business of ours, then we shall be guiltless of your oath which you have
made us to swear.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,21);</script>She said, “According
to your words, so be it.” She sent them away, and they departed. She
tied the scarlet line in the window.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,22);</script>They went, and came to
the mountain, and stayed there three days, until the pursuers had
returned. The pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but didn’t
find them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,23);</script>Then the two
men returned, descended from the mountain, passed over, and came to Joshua
the son of Nun; and they told him all that had happened to them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,24);</script>They said to Joshua, “Truly
Yahweh has delivered into our hands all the land. Moreover, all the
inhabitants of the land melt away before us.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,1);</script>Joshua rose up early in
the morning; and they moved from Shittim, and came to the Jordan, he and
all the children of Israel. They lodged there before they passed over.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,2);</script>It happened after three
days, that the officers went through the midst of the camp; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,3);</script>and they commanded the people,
saying, “When you see the ark of the covenant of Yahweh your God, and
the priests the Levites bearing it, then you shall move from your place,
and follow it. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,4);</script>Yet there
shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure.
Don’t come near to it, that you may know the way by which you must go;
for you have not passed this way before.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,5);</script>Joshua said to the
people, “Sanctify yourselves; for tomorrow Yahweh will do wonders among
you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,6);</script>Joshua spoke to the
priests, saying, “Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before
the people.” They took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the
people.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,7);</script>Yahweh said to Joshua,
“Today I will begin to magnify you in the sight of all Israel, that they
may know that as I was with Moses, so I will be with you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,8);</script>You shall command the priests who
bear the ark of the covenant, saying, ‘When you come to the brink of the
waters of the Jordan, you shall stand still in the Jordan.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,9);</script>Joshua said to the
children of Israel, “Come here, and hear the words of Yahweh your
God.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,10);</script>Joshua said,
“Hereby you shall know that the living God is among you, and that he
will without fail drive the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Hivite,
and the Perizzite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Jebusite
out from before you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,11);</script>Behold, the ark of the covenant
of the <a href="#N4">Lord</a> of all the earth passes over before you into
the Jordan. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,12);</script>Now therefore
take twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, for every tribe a man.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,13);</script>It shall come to pass,
when the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of Yahweh, the
Lord of all the earth, rest in the waters of the Jordan, that the waters
of the Jordan will be cut off, even the waters that come down from above;
and they shall stand in one heap.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,14);</script>It happened, when the
people moved from their tents to pass over the Jordan, the priests who
bore the ark of the covenant being before the people, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,15);</script>and when those who bore the ark
had come to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests who bore the ark had
dipped in the edge of the water (for the Jordan overflows all its banks
all the time of harvest), <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,16);</script>that the waters which came down
from above stood, and rose up in one heap, a great way off, at Adam, the
city that is beside Zarethan; and those that went down toward the sea of
the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, were wholly cut off. Then the people passed
over right against Jericho. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,17);</script>The priests who bore the ark of
the covenant of Yahweh stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the
Jordan; and all Israel passed over on dry ground, until all the nation had
passed completely over the Jordan.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,1);</script>It happened, when all
the nation had completely passed over the Jordan, that Yahweh spoke to
Joshua, saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,2);</script>“Take
twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,3);</script>and command them, saying, ‘Take
from out of the middle of the Jordan, out of the place where the
priests’ feet stood firm, twelve stones, and carry them over with you,
and lay them down in the lodging place, where you will lodge tonight.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,4);</script>Then Joshua called the
twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every
tribe a man. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,5);</script>Joshua said
to them, “Pass over before the ark of Yahweh your God into the middle of
the Jordan, and each of you pick up a stone and put it on your shoulder,
according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,6);</script>that this may be a sign among you,
that when your children ask in time to come, saying, ‘What do you mean
by these stones?’ <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,7);</script>then
you shall tell them, ‘Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off
before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh. When it passed over the Jordan,
the waters of the Jordan were cut off. These stones shall be for a
memorial to the children of Israel forever.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,8);</script>The children of Israel
did as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the middle of
the Jordan, as Yahweh spoke to Joshua, according to the number of the
tribes of the children of Israel; and they carried them over with them to
the place where they lodged, and laid them down there. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,9);</script>Joshua set up twelve stones in the
middle of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests who bore
the ark of the covenant stood; and they are there to this day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,10);</script>For the priests who bore the ark
stood in the middle of the Jordan, until everything was finished that
Yahweh commanded Joshua to speak to the people, according to all that
Moses commanded Joshua; and the people hurried and passed over. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,11);</script>It happened, when all the people
had completely passed over, that the ark of Yahweh passed over, with the
priests, in the presence of the people.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,12);</script>The children of
Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, passed
over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spoke to them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,13);</script>About forty thousand men, ready
and armed for war passed over before Yahweh to battle, to the plains of
Jericho. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,14);</script>On that day,
Yahweh magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him,
as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,15);</script>Yahweh spoke to
Joshua, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,16);</script>“Command the priests who bear
the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of the Jordan.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,17);</script>Joshua therefore
commanded the priests, saying, “Come up out of the Jordan!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,18);</script>It happened, when the priests who
bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh had come up out of the middle of
the Jordan, and the soles of the priests’ feet were lifted up to the dry
ground, that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place, and went
over all its banks, as before. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,19);</script>The people came up out of the
Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the
east border of Jericho.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,20);</script>Joshua set up those
twelve stones, which they took out of the Jordan, in Gilgal. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,21);</script>He spoke to the children of
Israel, saying, “When your children ask their fathers in time to come,
saying, ‘What do these stones mean?’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,22);</script>Then you shall let your children
know, saying, ‘Israel came over this Jordan on dry land. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,23);</script>For Yahweh your God dried up the
waters of the Jordan from before you, until you had passed over, as Yahweh
your God did to the <a href="#N5">Red Sea</a>, which he dried up from
before us, until we had passed over; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,24);</script>that all the peoples of the earth
may know the hand of Yahweh, that it is mighty; that you may fear Yahweh
your God forever.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,1);</script>It happened, when all
the kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan westward, and all
the kings of the Canaanites, who were by the sea, heard how that Yahweh
had dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel,
until we had passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there
spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,2);</script>At that time, Yahweh said to
Joshua, “Make flint knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel
the second time.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,3);</script>Joshua
made himself flint knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the
hill of the foreskins. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,4);</script>This is the reason Joshua
circumcised: all the people who came out of Egypt, who were males, even
all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out
of Egypt. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,5);</script>For all the
people who came out were circumcised; but all the people who were born in
the wilderness by the way as they came out of Egypt had not been
circumcised. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,6);</script>For the
children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, until all the
nation, even the men of war who came out of Egypt, were consumed, because
they didn’t listen to the voice of Yahweh. Yahweh swore to them that he
wouldn’t let them see the land which Yahweh swore to their fathers that
he would give us, a land flowing with milk and honey. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,7);</script>Their children, whom he raised up
in their place, were circumcised by Joshua; for they were uncircumcised,
because they had not circumcised them on the way. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,8);</script>It happened, when they were done
circumcising all the nation, that they stayed in their places in the camp
until they were healed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,9);</script>Yahweh said to Joshua,
“Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you.”
Therefore the name of that place was called <a href="#N6">Gilgal,</a> to
this day. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,10);</script>The children of
Israel encamped in Gilgal. They kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of
the month at evening in the plains of Jericho. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,11);</script>They ate unleavened cakes and
parched grain of the produce of the land on the next day after the
Passover, in the same day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,12);</script>The manna ceased on the next day,
after they had eaten of the produce of the land. The children of Israel
didn’t have manna any more; but they ate of the fruit of the land of
Canaan that year.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,13);</script>It happened, when
Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold,
a man stood in front of him with his sword drawn in his hand. Joshua went
to him, and said to him, “Are you for us, or for our adversaries?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,14);</script>He said, “No; but I
have come now as commander of Yahweh’s army.”
<p>Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and worshipped, and said to him,
“What does my lord say to his servant?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,15);</script>The prince of
Yahweh’s army said to Joshua, “Take your shoes off of your feet; for
the place on which you stand is holy.” Joshua did so.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,1);</script>Now Jericho was tightly
shut up because of the children of Israel. No one went out, and no one
came in. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,2);</script>Yahweh said to
Joshua, “Behold, I have given Jericho into your hand, with its king and
the mighty men of valor. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,3);</script>All your men of war shall march
around the city, going around the city once. You shall do this six days.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(6,4);</script>Seven priests shall bear
seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark. On the seventh day, you
shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the
trumpets. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,5);</script>It shall be that
when they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, and when you hear the
sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and
the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall go up
every man straight before him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,6);</script>Joshua the son of Nun
called the priests, and said to them, “Take up the ark of the covenant,
and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark
of Yahweh.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,7);</script>They said to the
people, “Advance! March around the city, and let the armed men pass on
before Yahweh’s ark.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,8);</script>It was so, that when
Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests bearing the seven
trumpets of rams’ horns before Yahweh advanced, and blew the trumpets;
and the ark of the covenant of Yahweh followed them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,9);</script>The armed men went before the
priests who blew the trumpets, and the ark went after them. The trumpets
sounded as they went.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,10);</script>Joshua commanded the
people, saying, “You shall not shout, nor let your voice be heard,
neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I tell you
to shout. Then you shall shout.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,11);</script>So he caused the ark of Yahweh to
go around the city, going about it once. Then they came into the camp, and
lodged in the camp. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,12);</script>Joshua rose early in the morning,
and the priests took up the ark of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,13);</script>The seven priests bearing the
seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of Yahweh went on
continually, and blew the trumpets: and the armed men went before them.
The rear guard came after the ark of Yahweh. The trumpets sounded as they
went. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,14);</script>The second day they
marched around the city once, and returned into the camp. They did this
six days.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,15);</script>It happened on the
seventh day, that they rose early at the dawning of the day, and marched
around the city in the same way seven times. Only on this day they marched
around the city seven times. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,16);</script>It happened at the seventh time,
when the priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, “Shout,
for Yahweh has given you the city! <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,17);</script>The city shall be devoted, even
it and all that is in it, to Yahweh. Only Rahab the prostitute shall live,
she and all who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers
that we sent. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,18);</script>But as for
you, only keep yourselves from the devoted thing, lest when you have
devoted it, you take of the devoted thing; so would you make the camp of
Israel accursed, and trouble it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,19);</script>But all the silver, and gold, and
vessels of brass and iron, are holy to Yahweh. They shall come into
Yahweh’s treasury.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,20);</script>So the people shouted,
and the priests blew the trumpets. It happened, when the people heard the
sound of the trumpet, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the
wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man
straight before him, and they took the city. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,21);</script>They utterly destroyed all that
was in the city, both man and woman, both young and old, and ox, and
sheep, and donkey, with the edge of the sword. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,22);</script>Joshua said to the two men who
had spied out the land, “Go into the prostitute’s house, and bring out
from there the woman and all that she has, as you swore to her.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,23);</script>The young men who were spies went
in, and brought out Rahab with her father, her mother, her brothers, and
all that she had. They also brought out all her relatives, and they set
them outside of the camp of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,24);</script>They burnt the city with fire,
and all that was in it. Only they put the silver, the gold, and the
vessels of brass and of iron into the treasury of Yahweh’s house.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(6,25);</script>But Rahab the prostitute,
her father’s household, and all that she had, Joshua saved alive. She
lived in the midst of Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers,
whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,26);</script>Joshua commanded them
with an oath at that time, saying, “Cursed is the man before Yahweh, who
rises up and builds this city Jericho. With the loss of his firstborn
shall he lay its foundation, and with the loss of his youngest son shall
he set up its gates.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,27);</script>So Yahweh was with Joshua; and
his fame was in all the land.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,1);</script>But the children of
Israel committed a trespass in the devoted things; for Achan, the son of
Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took
some of the devoted things. Therefore Yahweh’s anger burned against the
children of Israel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,2);</script>Joshua
sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth Aven, on the east side
of Bethel, and spoke to them, saying, “Go up and spy out the land.”
<p>The men went up and spied out Ai. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,3);</script>They returned to Joshua, and said
to him, “Don’t let all the people go up; but let about two or three
thousand men go up and strike Ai. Don’t make all the people to toil
there, for there are only a few of them.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,4);</script>So about three thousand men of the
people went up there, and they fled before the men of Ai. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,5);</script>The men of Ai struck about
thirty-six men of them, and they chased them from before the gate even to
Shebarim, and struck them at the descent. The hearts of the people melted,
and became like water. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,6);</script>Joshua tore his clothes, and fell
to the earth on his face before the ark of Yahweh until the evening, he
and the elders of Israel; and they put dust on their heads. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,7);</script>Joshua said, “Alas, Lord Yahweh,
why have you brought this people over the Jordan at all, to deliver us
into the hand of the Amorites, to cause us to perish? I wish that we had
been content and lived beyond the Jordan! <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,8);</script>Oh, Lord, what shall I say, after
that Israel has turned their backs before their enemies! <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,9);</script>For the Canaanites and all the
inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and will surround us, and cut off
our name from the earth. What will you do for your great name?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,10);</script>Yahweh said to Joshua,
“Get up! Why are you fallen on your face like that? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,11);</script>Israel has sinned. Yes, they have
even transgressed my covenant which I commanded them. Yes, they have even
taken of the devoted things, and have also stolen, and also deceived. They
have even put it among their own stuff. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,12);</script>Therefore the children of Israel
can’t stand before their enemies. They turn their backs before their
enemies, because they have become devoted for destruction. I will not be
with you any more, unless you destroy the devoted things from among you.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,13);</script>“Get up! Sanctify
the people, and say, ‘Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, for Yahweh, the
God of Israel, says, “There is a devoted thing in the midst of you,
Israel. You cannot stand before your enemies until you take away the
devoted thing from among you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,14);</script>“‘In the morning
therefore you shall be brought near by your tribes. It shall be that the
tribe which Yahweh selects shall come near by families. The family which
Yahweh selects shall come near by households. The household which Yahweh
selects shall come near man by man. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,15);</script>It shall be, that he who is taken
with the devoted thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he has,
because he has transgressed the covenant of Yahweh, and because he has
done a disgraceful thing in Israel.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,16);</script>So Joshua rose up
early in the morning and brought Israel near by their tribes. The tribe of
Judah was selected. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,17);</script>He
brought near the family of Judah; and he selected the family of the
Zerahites. He brought near the family of the Zerahites man by man, and
Zabdi was selected. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,18);</script>He
brought near his household man by man, and Achan, the son of Carmi, the
son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was selected.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,19);</script>Joshua said to Achan,
“My son, please give glory to Yahweh, the God of Israel, and make
confession to him. Tell me now what you have done! Don’t hide it from
me!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,20);</script>Achan answered Joshua,
and said, “I have truly sinned against Yahweh, the God of Israel, and
this is what I have done. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,21);</script>When I saw among the spoil a
beautiful Babylonian robe, two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of
gold weighing fifty shekels, then I coveted them and took them. Behold,
they are hidden in the ground in the middle of my tent, with the silver
under it.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,22);</script>So Joshua sent
messengers, and they ran to the tent. Behold, it was hidden in his tent,
with the silver under it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,23);</script>They took them from the middle of
the tent, and brought them to Joshua and to all the children of Israel.
They laid them down before Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,24);</script>Joshua, and all Israel with him,
took Achan the son of Zerah, the silver, the robe, the wedge of gold, his
sons, his daughters, his cattle, his donkeys, his sheep, his tent, and all
that he had; and they brought them up to the valley of Achor. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,25);</script>Joshua said, “Why have you
troubled us? Yahweh will trouble you this day.” All Israel stoned him
with stones, and they burned them with fire and stoned them with stones.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,26);</script>They raised over him a
great heap of stones that remains to this day. Yahweh turned from the
fierceness of his anger. Therefore the name of that place was called
“The valley of Achor” to this day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,1);</script>Yahweh said to Joshua,
“Don’t be afraid, neither be dismayed. Take all the people of war with
you, and arise, go up to Ai. Behold, I have given into your hand the king
of Ai, with his people, his city, and his land. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,2);</script>You shall do to Ai and her king as
you did to Jericho and her king, except its spoil and its livestock, you
shall take for a plunder for yourselves. Set an ambush for the city behind
it.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,3);</script>So Joshua arose, and
all the people of war, to go up to Ai. Joshua chose thirty thousand men,
the mighty men of valor, and sent them out by night. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,4);</script>He commanded them, saying,
“Behold, you shall lie in ambush against the city, behind the city.
Don’t go very far from the city, but all of you be ready. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,5);</script>I, and all the people who are with
me, will approach to the city. It shall happen, when they come out against
us, as at the first, that we will flee before them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,6);</script>They will come out after us, until
we have drawn them away from the city; for they will say, ‘They flee
before us, like the first time.’ So we will flee before them, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,7);</script>and you shall rise up from the
ambush, and take possession of the city; for Yahweh your God will deliver
it into your hand. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,8);</script>It
shall be, when you have seized on the city, that you shall set the city on
fire. You shall do this according to the word of Yahweh. Behold, I have
commanded you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,9);</script>Joshua sent them out;
and they went to set up the ambush, and stayed between Bethel and Ai, on
the west side of Ai; but Joshua stayed among the people that night.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,10);</script>Joshua rose up early in
the morning, mustered the people, and went up, he and the elders of
Israel, before the people to Ai. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,11);</script>All the people, even the men of
war who were with him, went up, and drew near, and came before the city,
and encamped on the north side of Ai. Now there was a valley between him
and Ai. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,12);</script>He took about
five thousand men, and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the
west side of the city. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,13);</script>So
they set the people, even all the army who was on the north of the city,
and their ambush on the west of the city; and Joshua went that night into
the midst of the valley. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,14);</script>It happened, when the king of Ai
saw it, that they hurried and rose up early, and the men of the city went
out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at the time
appointed, before the Arabah; but he didn’t know that there was an
ambush against him behind the city. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,15);</script>Joshua and all Israel made as if
they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,16);</script>All the people who were
in the city were called together to pursue after them. They pursued
Joshua, and were drawn away from the city. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,17);</script>There was not a man left in Ai or
Beth El who didn’t go out after Israel. They left the city open, and
pursued Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,18);</script>Yahweh said to Joshua,
“Stretch out the javelin that is in your hand toward Ai, for I will give
it into your hand.”
<p>Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,19);</script>The ambush arose quickly
out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand,
and entered into the city, and took it. They hurried and set the city on
fire. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,20);</script>When the men of Ai
looked behind them, they saw, and behold, the smoke of the city ascended
up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way. The
people who fled to the wilderness turned back on the pursuers. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,21);</script>When Joshua and all Israel saw
that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city
ascended, then they turned again, and killed the men of Ai. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,22);</script>The others came out of the city
against them, so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and
some on that side. They struck them, so that they let none of them remain
or escape. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,23);</script>They captured
the king of Ai alive, and brought him to Joshua.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,24);</script>It happened, when
Israel had made an end of killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the field,
in the wilderness in which they pursued them, and they had all fallen by
the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all Israel returned
to Ai, and struck it with the edge of the sword. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,25);</script>All that fell that day, both of
men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,26);</script>For Joshua didn’t draw back his
hand, with which he stretched out the javelin, until he had utterly
destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,27);</script>Only the livestock and the spoil
of that city Israel took for prey to themselves, according to the word of
Yahweh which he commanded Joshua. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,28);</script>So Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a
heap forever, even a desolation, to this day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,29);</script>He hanged the king of Ai on a
tree until the evening, and at the sundown Joshua commanded, and they took
his body down from the tree, and threw it at the entrance of the gate of
the city, and raised a great heap of stones on it that remains to this day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,30);</script>Then Joshua built an
altar to Yahweh, the God of Israel, in Mount Ebal, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,31);</script>as Moses the servant of Yahweh
commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law
of Moses, an altar of uncut stones, on which no man had lifted up any
iron. They offered burnt offerings on it to Yahweh, and sacrificed peace
offerings. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,32);</script>He wrote there
on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence
of the children of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,33);</script>All Israel, and their elders and
officers, and their judges, stood on this side of the ark and on that side
before the priests the Levites, who carried the ark of Yahweh’s
covenant, the foreigner as well as the native; half of them in front of
Mount Gerizim, and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses the
servant of Yahweh had commanded at the first, that they should bless the
people of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,34);</script>Afterward he read all the words
of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written
in the book of the law. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,35);</script>There was not a word of all that
Moses commanded, which Joshua didn’t read before all the assembly of
Israel, with the women, the little ones, and the foreigners who were among
them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,1);</script>It happened, when all
the kings who were beyond the Jordan, in the hill country, and in the
lowland, and on all the shore of the great sea in front of Lebanon, the
Hittite, the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the
Jebusite, heard of it <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,2);</script>that
they gathered themselves together to fight with Joshua and with Israel,
with one accord. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,3);</script>But when
the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,4);</script>they also resorted to a
ruse, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old
sacks on their donkeys, and wineskins, old and torn and bound up, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,5);</script>and old and patched shoes on their
feet, and wore old garments. All the bread of their provision was dry and
moldy. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,6);</script>They went to Joshua
to the camp at Gilgal, and said to him, and to the men of Israel, “We
have come from a far country. Now therefore make a covenant with us.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,7);</script>The men of Israel said
to the Hivites, “What if you live among us. How could we make a covenant
with you?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,8);</script>They said to Joshua,
“We are your servants.”
<p>Joshua said to them, “Who are you? Where do you come from?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,9);</script>They said to him,
“Your servants have come from a very far country because of the name of
Yahweh your God; for we have heard of his fame, all that he did in Egypt,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,10);</script>and all that he did to
the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon king of
Heshbon and to Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,11);</script>Our elders and all the
inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, ‘Take provision in your
hand for the journey, and go to meet them, and tell them, “We are your
servants. Now make a covenant with us.”’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,12);</script>This our bread we took hot for
our provision out of our houses on the day we went out to go to you; but
now, behold, it is dry, and has become moldy. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,13);</script>These wineskins, which we filled,
were new; and behold, they are torn. These our garments and our shoes have
become old because of the very long journey.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,14);</script>The men sampled their
provisions, and didn’t ask counsel from the mouth of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,15);</script>Joshua made peace with them, and
made a covenant with them, to let them live. The princes of the
congregation swore to them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,16);</script>It happened at the end of three
days after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they
were their neighbors, and that they lived among them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,17);</script>The children of Israel traveled
and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon,
Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath Jearim. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,18);</script>The children of Israel didn’t
strike them, because the princes of the congregation had sworn to them by
Yahweh, the God of Israel. All the congregation murmured against the
princes. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,19);</script>But all the
princes said to all the congregation, “We have sworn to them by Yahweh,
the God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,20);</script>This we will do to them, and let
them live; lest wrath be on us, because of the oath which we swore to
them.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,21);</script>The princes said
to them, “Let them live, so they became wood cutters and drawers of
water for all the congregation, as the princes had spoken to them.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,22);</script>Joshua called for
them, and he spoke to them, saying, “Why have you deceived us, saying,
‘We are very far from you,’ when you live among us? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,23);</script>Now therefore you are cursed, and
some of you will never fail to be bondservants, both wood cutters and
drawers of water for the house of my God.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,24);</script>They answered Joshua,
and said, “Because your servants were certainly told how Yahweh your God
commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all
the inhabitants of the land from before you. Therefore we were very afraid
for our lives because of you, and have done this thing. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,25);</script>Now, behold, we are in your hand.
Do to us as it seems good and right to you to do.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,26);</script>He did so to them, and
delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, so that they
didn’t kill them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,27);</script>That
day Joshua made them wood cutters and drawers of water for the
congregation and for the altar of Yahweh, to this day, in the place which
he should choose.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,1);</script>Now it happened when
Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had
utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had
done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace
with Israel, and were among them; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,2);</script>that they were very afraid,
because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because
it was greater than Ai, and all its men were mighty. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,3);</script>Therefore Adoni-Zedek king of
Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, to Piram king of Jarmuth, to
Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,4);</script>“Come up to me, and help me,
and let us strike Gibeon; for it has made peace with Joshua and with the
children of Israel.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,5);</script>Therefore the five kings of the
Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth,
the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and
went up, they and all their armies, and encamped against Gibeon, and made
war against it. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,6);</script>The men
of Gibeon sent to Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, “Don’t abandon
your servants! Come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us; for all
the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill country have gathered
together against us.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,7);</script>So Joshua went up from
Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of
valor. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,8);</script>Yahweh said to
Joshua, “Don’t fear them, for I have delivered them into your hands.
Not a man of them will stand before you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,9);</script>Joshua therefore came
on them suddenly. He went up from Gilgal all night. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,10);</script>Yahweh confused them before
Israel, and he killed them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased
them by the way of the ascent of Beth Horon, and struck them to Azekah and
to Makkedah. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,11);</script>It
happened, as they fled from before Israel, while they were at the descent
of Beth Horon, that Yahweh cast down great stones from the sky on them to
Azekah, and they died. There were more who died from the hailstones than
who the children of Israel killed with the sword.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,12);</script>Then Joshua spoke to
Yahweh in the day when Yahweh delivered up the Amorites before the
children of Israel; and he said in the sight of Israel, “Sun, stand
still on Gibeon! You, moon, stop in the valley of Aijalon!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,13);</script>The sun stood still,
and the moon stayed, until the nation had avenged themselves of their
enemies. Isn’t this written in the book of Jashar? The sun stayed in the
midst of the sky, and didn’t hurry to go down about a whole day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,14);</script>There was no day like that
before it or after it, that Yahweh listened to the voice of a man; for
Yahweh fought for Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,15);</script>Joshua returned, and
all Israel with him, to the camp to Gilgal. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,16);</script>These five kings fled, and hid
themselves in the cave at Makkedah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,17);</script>Joshua was told, saying, “The
five kings are found, hidden in the cave at Makkedah.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,18);</script>Joshua said, “Roll
large stones to the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to guard them;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(10,19);</script>but don’t stay. Pursue
your enemies, and them from the rear. Don’t allow them to enter into
their cities; for Yahweh your God has delivered them into your hand.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,20);</script>It happened, when
Joshua and the children of Israel had finished killing them with a very
great slaughter until they were consumed, and the remnant which remained
of them had entered into the fortified cities, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,21);</script>that all the people returned to
the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace. None moved his tongue against any
of the children of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,22);</script>Then Joshua said, “Open the
mouth of the cave, and bring those five kings out of the cave to me.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,23);</script>They did so, and
brought those five kings out of the cave to him: the king of Jerusalem,
the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king
of Eglon. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,24);</script>It happened,
when they brought those kings out to Joshua, that Joshua called for all
the men of Israel, and said to the chiefs of the men of war who went with
him, “Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings.”
<p>They came near, and put their feet on their necks.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,25);</script>Joshua said to them,
“Don’t be afraid, nor be dismayed. Be strong and courageous, for
Yahweh will do this to all your enemies against whom you fight.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,26);</script>Afterward Joshua
struck them, put them to death, and hanged them on five trees. They were
hanging on the trees until the evening. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,27);</script>It happened at the time of the
going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off
the trees, and cast them into the cave in which they had hidden
themselves, and laid great stones on the mouth of the cave, which remain
to this very day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,28);</script>Joshua took Makkedah
on that day, and struck it with the edge of the sword, with its king. He
utterly destroyed them and all the souls who were in it. He left none
remaining. He did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of
Jericho.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,29);</script>Joshua passed from
Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah, and fought against Libnah.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(10,30);</script>Yahweh delivered it
also, with its king, into the hand of Israel. He struck it with the edge
of the sword, and all the souls who were in it. He left none remaining in
it. He did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,31);</script>Joshua passed from
Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish, and encamped against it, and
fought against it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,32);</script>Yahweh delivered Lachish into
the hand of Israel. He took it on the second day, and struck it with the
edge of the sword, with all the souls who were in it, according to all
that he had done to Libnah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,33);</script>Then Horam king of Gezer came up
to help Lachish; and Joshua struck him and his people, until he had left
him none remaining.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,34);</script>Joshua passed from
Lachish, and all Israel with him, to Eglon; and they encamped against it
fought against it. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,35);</script>They
took it on that day, and struck it with the edge of the sword. He utterly
destroyed all the souls who were in it that day, according to all that he
had done to Lachish.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,36);</script>Joshua went up from
Eglon, and all Israel with him, to Hebron; and they fought against it.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(10,37);</script>They took it, and struck
it with the edge of the sword, with its king and all its cities, and all
the souls who were in it. He left none remaining, according to all that he
had done to Eglon; but he utterly destroyed it, and all the souls who were
in it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,38);</script>Joshua returned, and
all Israel with him, to Debir, and fought against it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,39);</script>He took it, with its king and
all its cities. They struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly
destroyed all the souls who were in it. He left none remaining. As he had
done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to its king; as he had done also
to Libnah, and to its king. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,40);</script>So Joshua struck all the land,
the hill country, and the South, and the lowland, and the slopes, and all
their kings. He left none remaining, but he utterly destroyed all that
breathed, as Yahweh, the God of Israel, commanded. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,41);</script>Joshua struck them from Kadesh
Barnea even to Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even to Gibeon.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(10,42);</script>Joshua took all these
kings and their land at one time, because Yahweh, the God of Israel,
fought for Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,43);</script>Joshua returned, and all Israel
with him, to the camp to Gilgal.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,1);</script>It happened, when
Jabin king of Hazor heard of it, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, to
the king of Shimron, to the king of Achshaph, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,2);</script>and to the kings who were on the
north, in the hill country, in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, in the
lowland, and in the heights of Dor on the west, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,3);</script>to the Canaanite on the east and
on the west, and the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the
Jebusite in the hill country, and the Hivite under Hermon in the land of
Mizpah. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,4);</script>They went out,
they and all their armies with them, many people, even as the sand that is
on the seashore in multitude, with very many horses and chariots. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,5);</script>All these kings met together; and
they came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight with
Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,6);</script>Yahweh said to Joshua,
“Don’t be afraid because of them; for tomorrow at this time, I will
deliver them up all slain before Israel. You shall hamstring their horses
and burn their chariots with fire.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,7);</script>So Joshua came, and
all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom
suddenly, and fell on them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,8);</script>Yahweh delivered them into the
hand of Israel, and they struck them, and chased them to great Sidon, and
to Misrephoth Maim, and to the valley of Mizpeh eastward. They struck them
until they left them none remaining. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,9);</script>Joshua did to them as Yahweh told
him. He hamstrung their horses and burnt their chariots with fire. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,10);</script>Joshua turned back at that time,
and took Hazor, and struck its king with the sword: for Hazor used to be
the head of all those kingdoms. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,11);</script>They struck all the souls who
were in it with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them. There was
no one left who breathed. He burnt Hazor with fire. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,12);</script>Joshua captured all the cities
of those kings, with their kings, and he struck them with the edge of the
sword, and utterly destroyed them; as Moses the servant of Yahweh
commanded. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,13);</script>But as for
the cities that stood on their mounds, Israel burned none of them, except
Hazor only. Joshua burned that. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,14);</script>The children of Israel took all
the spoil of these cities, with the livestock, as spoils for themselves;
but every man they struck with the edge of the sword, until they had
destroyed them. They didn’t leave any who breathed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,15);</script>As Yahweh commanded
Moses his servant, so Moses commanded Joshua. Joshua did so. He left
nothing undone of all that Yahweh commanded Moses. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,16);</script>So Joshua captured all that
land, the hill country, all the South, all the land of Goshen, the
lowland, the Arabah, the hill country of Israel, and the lowland of the
same; <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,17);</script>from Mount Halak,
that goes up to Seir, even to Baal Gad in the valley of Lebanon under
Mount Hermon. He took all their kings, struck them, and put them to death.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,18);</script>Joshua made war a long
time with all those kings. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,19);</script>There was not a city that made
peace with the children of Israel, except the Hivites, the inhabitants of
Gibeon. They took all in battle. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,20);</script>For it was of Yahweh to harden
their hearts, to come against Israel in battle, that he might utterly
destroy them, that they might have no favor, but that he might destroy
them, as Yahweh commanded Moses. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,21);</script>Joshua came at that time, and
cut off the Anakim from the hill country, from Hebron, from Debir, from
Anab, and from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill
country of Israel: Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,22);</script>There were none of the
Anakim left in the land of the children of Israel. Only in Gaza, in Gath,
and in Ashdod, did some remain. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,23);</script>So Joshua took the whole land,
according to all that Yahweh spoke to Moses; and Joshua gave it for an
inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. The
land had rest from war.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,1);</script>Now these are the
kings of the land, whom the children of Israel struck, and possessed their
land beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise, from the valley of the Arnon to
Mount Hermon, and all the Arabah eastward: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,2);</script>Sihon king of the Amorites, who
lived in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley
of the Arnon, and the middle of the valley, and half Gilead, even to the
river Jabbok, the border of the children of Ammon; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,3);</script>and the Arabah to the sea of
Chinneroth, eastward, and to the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea,
eastward, the way to Beth Jeshimoth; and on the south, under the slopes of
Pisgah: <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,4);</script>and the border of
Og king of Bashan, of the remnant of the Rephaim, who lived at Ashtaroth
and at Edrei, <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,5);</script>and ruled
in Mount Hermon, and in Salecah, and in all Bashan, to the border of the
Geshurites and the Maacathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king
of Heshbon.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,6);</script>Moses the servant of
Yahweh and the children of Israel struck them. Moses the servant of Yahweh
gave it for a possession to the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the
half-tribe of Manasseh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,7);</script>These are the kings of the land
whom Joshua and the children of Israel struck beyond the Jordan westward,
from Baal Gad in the valley of Lebanon even to Mount Halak, that goes up
to Seir. Joshua gave it to the tribes of Israel for a possession according
to their divisions; <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,8);</script>in
the hill country, and in the lowland, and in the Arabah, and in the
slopes, and in the wilderness, and in the South; the Hittite, the Amorite,
and the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,9);</script>the king of Jericho, one; the
king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,10);</script>the king of Jerusalem, one; the
king of Hebron, one; <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,11);</script>the
king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,12);</script>the king of Eglon, one; the king
of Gezer, one; <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,13);</script>the king
of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,14);</script>the king of Hormah, one; the
king of Arad, one; <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,15);</script>the
king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,16);</script>the king of Makkedah, one; the
king of Bethel, one; <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,17);</script>the
king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,18);</script>the king of Aphek, one; the king
of Lassharon, one; <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,19);</script>the
king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,20);</script>the king of Shimron Meron, one;
the king of Achshaph, one; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,21);</script>the king of Taanach, one; the
king of Megiddo, one; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,22);</script>the king of Kedesh, one; the
king of Jokneam in Carmel, one; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,23);</script>the king of Dor in the height of
Dor, one; the king of Goiim in Gilgal, one; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,24);</script>the king of Tirzah, one: all the
kings thirty-one.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,1);</script>Now Joshua was old and
well advanced in years. Yahweh said to him, “You are old and advanced in
years, and there remains yet very much land to be possessed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,2);</script>“This is the land
that still remains: all the regions of the Philistines, and all the
Geshurites; <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,3);</script>from the
Shihor, which is before Egypt, even to the border of Ekron northward,
which is counted as Canaanite; the five lords of the Philistines; the
Gazites, and the Ashdodites, the Ashkelonites, the Gittites, and the
Ekronites; also the Avvim, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,4);</script>on the south; all the land of the
Canaanites, and Mearah that belongs to the Sidonians, to Aphek, to the
border of the Amorites; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,5);</script>and the land of the Gebalites,
and all Lebanon, toward the sunrise, from Baal Gad under Mount Hermon to
the entrance of Hamath; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,6);</script>all the inhabitants of the hill
country from Lebanon to Misrephoth Maim, even all the Sidonians; them will
I drive out from before the children of Israel: only allocate it to Israel
for an inheritance, as I have commanded you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,7);</script>Now therefore divide this land
for an inheritance to the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh.”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,8);</script>With him the Reubenites
and the Gadites received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond
the Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of Yahweh gave them:
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,9);</script>from Aroer, that is on
the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of
the valley, and all the plain of Medeba to Dibon; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,10);</script>and all the cities of Sihon king
of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, to the border of the children of
Ammon; <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,11);</script>and Gilead, and
the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and all Mount Hermon, and
all Bashan to Salecah; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,12);</script>all the kingdom of Og in Bashan,
who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei (the same was left of the remnant of
the Rephaim); for Moses attacked these, and drove them out. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,13);</script>Nevertheless the children of
Israel didn’t drive out the Geshurites, nor the Maacathites: but Geshur
and Maacath dwell in the midst of Israel to this day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,14);</script>Only he gave no inheritance to
the tribe of Levi. The offerings of Yahweh, the God of Israel, made by
fire are his inheritance, as he spoke to him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,15);</script>Moses gave to the tribe of the
children of Reuben according to their families. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,16);</script>Their border was from Aroer,
that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in
the middle of the valley, and all the plain by Medeba; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,17);</script>Heshbon, and all its cities that
are in the plain; Dibon, Bamoth Baal, Beth Baal Meon, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,18);</script>Jahaz, Kedemoth, Mephaath,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,19);</script>Kiriathaim, Sibmah,
Zereth Shahar in the mount of the valley, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,20);</script>Beth Peor, the slopes of Pisgah,
Beth Jeshimoth, <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,21);</script>all the
cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites,
who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses struck with the chiefs of Midian, Evi,
Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, the princes of Sihon, who lived in the land.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,22);</script>The children of Israel
alse killed Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, with the sword,
among the rest of their slain.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,23);</script>The border of the
children of Reuben was the bank of the Jordan. This was the inheritance of
the children of Reuben according to their families, the cities and its
villages.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,24);</script>Moses gave to the
tribe of Gad, to the children of Gad, according to their families. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,25);</script>Their border was Jazer, and all
the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, to Aroer
that is before Rabbah; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,26);</script>and from Heshbon to Ramath
Mizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim to the border of Debir; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,27);</script>and in the valley, Beth Haram,
Beth Nimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of
Heshbon, the Jordan’s bank, to the uttermost part of the sea of
Chinnereth beyond the Jordan eastward. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,28);</script>This is the inheritance of the
children of Gad according to their families, the cities and its villages.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,29);</script>Moses gave an
inheritance to the half-tribe of Manasseh. It was for the half-tribe of
the children of Manasseh according to their families. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,30);</script>Their border was from Mahanaim,
all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of
Jair, which are in Bashan, sixty cities. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,31);</script>Half Gilead, Ashtaroth, and
Edrei, the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were for the children of
Machir the son of Manasseh, even for the half of the children of Machir
according to their families.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,32);</script>These are the
inheritances which Moses distributed in the plains of Moab, beyond the
Jordan at Jericho, eastward. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,33);</script>But to the tribe of Levi Moses
gave no inheritance. Yahweh, the God of Israel, is their inheritance, as
he spoke to them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,1);</script>These are the
inheritances which the children of Israel took in the land of Canaan,
which Eleazar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the
fathers’ houses of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed to
them, <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,2);</script>by the lot of their
inheritance, as Yahweh commanded by Moses, for the nine tribes, and for
the half-tribe. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,3);</script>For Moses
had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the
Jordan; but to the Levites he gave no inheritance among them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,4);</script>For the children of Joseph were
two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: and they gave no portion to the Levites
in the land, except cities to dwell in, with their suburbs for their
livestock and for their property. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,5);</script>The children of Israel did as
Yahweh commanded Moses, and they divided the land.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,6);</script>Then the children of
Judah drew near to Joshua in Gilgal. Caleb the son of Jephunneh the
Kenizzite said to him, “You know the thing that Yahweh spoke to Moses
the man of God concerning me and concerning you in Kadesh Barnea. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,7);</script>I was forty years old when Moses
the servant of Yahweh sent me from Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land. I
brought him word again as it was in my heart. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,8);</script>Nevertheless, my brothers who
went up with me made the heart of the people melt; but I wholly followed
Yahweh my God. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,9);</script>Moses
swore on that day, saying, ‘Surely the land where you walked shall be an
inheritance to you and to your children forever, because you have wholly
followed Yahweh my God.’
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,10);</script>“Now, behold,
Yahweh has kept me alive, as he spoke, these forty-five years, from the
time that Yahweh spoke this word to Moses, while Israel walked in the
wilderness. Now, behold, I am eighty-five years old, today. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,11);</script>As yet I am as strong today as I
was in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my
strength now for war, to go out and to come in. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,12);</script>Now therefore give me this hill
country, of which Yahweh spoke in that day; for you heard in that day how
the Anakim were there, and great and fortified cities. It may be that
Yahweh will be with me, and I shall drive them out, as Yahweh spoke.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,13);</script>Joshua blessed him;
and he gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(14,14);</script>Therefore Hebron became
the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day;
because he wholly followed Yahweh, the God of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,15);</script>Now the name of Hebron before
was Kiriath Arba, after the greatest man among the Anakim. The land had
rest from war.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,1);</script>The lot for the tribe
of the children of Judah according to their families was to the border of
Edom, even to the wilderness of Zin southward, at the uttermost part of
the south. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,2);</script>Their south
border was from the uttermost part of the Salt Sea, from the bay that
looks southward; <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,3);</script>and it
went out southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and
went up by the south of Kadesh Barnea, and passed along by Hezron, went up
to Addar, and turned about to Karka; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,4);</script>and it passed along to Azmon,
went out at the brook of Egypt; and the border ended at the sea. This
shall be your south border. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,5);</script>The east border was the Salt Sea,
even to the end of the Jordan. The border of the north quarter was from
the bay of the sea at the end of the Jordan. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,6);</script>The border went up to Beth
Hoglah, and passed along by the north of Beth Arabah; and the border went
up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,7);</script>The border went up to Debir from
the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is over
against the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the river.
The border passed along to the waters of En Shemesh, and ended at En
Rogel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,8);</script>The border went up
by the valley of the son of Hinnom to the side of the Jebusite southward
(the same is Jerusalem); and the border went up to the top of the mountain
that lies before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the farthest
part of the valley of Rephaim northward. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,9);</script>The border extended from the top
of the mountain to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah, and went out to
the cities of Mount Ephron; and the border extended to Baalah (the same is
Kiriath Jearim); <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,10);</script>and the
border turned about from Baalah westward to Mount Seir, and passed along
to the side of Mount Jearim on the north (the same is Chesalon), and went
down to Beth Shemesh, and passed along by Timnah; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,11);</script>and the border went out to the
side of Ekron northward; and the border extended to Shikkeron, and passed
along to Mount Baalah, and went out at Jabneel; and the goings out of the
border were at the sea. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,12);</script>The west border was to the shore
of the great sea. This is the border of the children of Judah according to
their families.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,13);</script>To Caleb the son of
Jephunneh he gave a portion among the children of Judah, according to the
commandment of Yahweh to Joshua, even Kiriath Arba, named after the father
of Anak (the same is Hebron). <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,14);</script>Caleb drove out the three sons
of Anak: Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,15);</script>He went up against the
inhabitants of Debir: now the name of Debir before was Kiriath Sepher.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(15,16);</script>Caleb said, “He who
strikes Kiriath Sepher, and takes it, to him will I give Achsah my
daughter as wife.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,17);</script>Othniel the son of Kenaz, the
brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(15,18);</script>It happened, when she
came, that she had him ask her father fore a field. She got off of her
donkey, and Caleb said, “What do you want?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,19);</script>She said, “Give me
a blessing. Because you have set me in the land of the South, give me also
springs of water.”
<p>He gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,20);</script>This is the
inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their
families. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,21);</script>The farthest
cities of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the border of Edom in
the South were Kabzeel, Eder, Jagur, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,22);</script>Kinah, Dimonah, Adadah, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,23);</script>Kedesh, Hazor, Ithnan, <script

(the same is Hazor), <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,26);</script>Amam, Shema, Moladah, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,27);</script>Hazar Gaddah, Heshmon, Beth

Middin, Secacah, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,62);</script>Nibshan, the City of Salt, and
En Gedi; six cities with their villages.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,63);</script>As for the Jebusites,
the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah couldn’t drive them
out; but the Jebusites live with the children of Judah at Jerusalem to
this day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,1);</script>The lot came out for
the children of Joseph from the Jordan at Jericho, at the waters of
Jericho on the east, even the wilderness, going up from Jericho through
the hill country to Bethel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,2);</script>It went out from Bethel to Luz,
and passed along to the border of the Archites to Ataroth; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,3);</script>and it went down westward to the
border of the Japhletites, to the border of Beth Horon the lower, even to
Gezer; and ended at the sea.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,4);</script>The children of
Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their inheritance. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,5);</script>This was the border of the
children of Ephraim according to their families. The border of their
inheritance eastward was Ataroth Addar, to Beth Horon the upper. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,6);</script>The border went out westward at
Michmethath on the north. The border turned about eastward to Taanath
Shiloh, and passed along it on the east of Janoah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,7);</script>It went down from Janoah to
Ataroth, to Naarah, reached to Jericho, and went out at the Jordan.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(16,8);</script>From Tappuah the border
went along westward to the brook of Kanah; and ended at the sea. This is
the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim according to their
families; <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,9);</script>together with
the cities which were set apart for the children of Ephraim in the midst
of the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their
villages. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,10);</script>They didn’t
drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwell in
the midst of Ephraim to this day, and have become servants to do forced
labor.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,1);</script>This was the lot for
the tribe of Manasseh, for he was the firstborn of Joseph. As for Machir
the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, because he was a man of
war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,2);</script>So this was for the rest of the
children of Manasseh according to their families: for the children of
Abiezer, for the children of Helek, for the children of Asriel, for the
children of Shechem, for the children of Hepher, and for the children of
Shemida: these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph
according to their families. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,3);</script>But Zelophehad, the son of
Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no
sons, but daughters: and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah,
Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,4);</script>They came near before Eleazar the
priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying,
“Yahweh commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers.”
Therefore according to the commandment of Yahweh he gave them an
inheritance among the brothers of their father. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,5);</script>Ten parts fell to Manasseh,
besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,6);</script>because the daughters of Manasseh
had an inheritance among his sons. The land of Gilead belonged to the rest
of the sons of Manasseh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,7);</script>The border of Manasseh was from
Asher to Michmethath, which is before Shechem. The border went along to
the right hand, to the inhabitants of En Tappuah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,8);</script>The land of Tappuah belonged to
Manasseh; but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children
of Ephraim. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,9);</script>The border
went down to the brook of Kanah, southward of the brook. These cities
belonged to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh. The border of Manasseh
was on the north side of the brook, and ended at the sea. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,10);</script>Southward it was Ephraim’s,
and northward it was Manasseh’s, and the sea was his border. They
reached to Asher on the north, and to Issachar on the east. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,11);</script>Manasseh had three heights in
Issachar, in Asher Beth Shean and its towns, and Ibleam and its towns, and
the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and its
towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants
of Megiddo and its towns. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,12);</script>Yet the children of Manasseh
couldn’t drive out the inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites
would dwell in that land.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,13);</script>It happened, when the
children of Israel had grown strong, that they put the Canaanites to
forced labor, and didn’t utterly drive them out. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,14);</script>The children of Joseph spoke to
Joshua, saying, “Why have you given me just one lot and one part for an
inheritance, since I am a great people, because Yahweh has blessed me so
far?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,15);</script>Joshua said to them,
“If you are a great people, go up to the forest, and clear land for
yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim; since the
hill country of Ephraim is too narrow for you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,16);</script>The children of
Joseph said, “The hill country is not enough for us. All the Canaanites
who dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both those who
are in Beth Shean and its towns, and those who are in the valley of
Jezreel.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,17);</script>Joshua spoke to the
house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, “You are a
great people, and have great power. You shall not have one lot only;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(17,18);</script>but the hill country
shall be yours. Although it is a forest, you shall cut it down, and it’s
farthest extent shall be yours; for you shall drive out the Canaanites,
though they have chariots of iron, and though they are strong.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,1);</script>The whole congregation
of the children of Israel assembled themselves together at Shiloh, and set
up the Tent of Meeting there. The land was subdued before them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,2);</script>Seven tribes remained among the
children of Israel, which had not yet divided their inheritance. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,3);</script>Joshua said to the children of
Israel, “How long will you neglect to go in to possess the land, which
Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has given you? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,4);</script>Appoint for yourselves three men
from each tribe. I will send them, and they shall arise, walk through the
land, and describe it according to their inheritance; and they shall come
to me. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,5);</script>They shall divide
it into seven portions. Judah shall live in his borders on the south, and
the house of Joseph shall live in their borders on the north. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,6);</script>You shall survey the land into
seven parts, and bring the description here to me; and I will cast lots
for you here before Yahweh our God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,7);</script>For the Levites have no portion
among you; for the priesthood of Yahweh is their inheritance. Gad, Reuben,
and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance beyond the
Jordan eastward, which Moses the servant of Yahweh gave them.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,8);</script>The men arose and
went. Joshua commanded those who went to survey the land, saying, “Go
walk through the land, survey it, and come again to me. I will cast lots
for you here before Yahweh in Shiloh.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,9);</script>The men went and
passed through the land, and surveyed it by cities into seven portions in
a book. They came to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,10);</script>Joshua cast lots for them in
Shiloh before Yahweh. There Joshua divided the land to the children of
Israel according to their divisions.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,11);</script>The lot of the tribe
of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families. The
border of their lot went out between the children of Judah and the
children of Joseph. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,12);</script>Their border on the north
quarter was from the Jordan. The border went up to the side of Jericho on
the north, and went up through the hill country westward. It ended at the
wilderness of Beth Aven. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,13);</script>The border passed along from
there to Luz, to the side of Luz (the same is Bethel), southward. The
border went down to Ataroth Addar, by the mountain that lies on the south
of Beth Horon the lower. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,14);</script>The border extended, and turned
around on the west quarter southward, from the mountain that lies before
Beth Horon southward; and ended at Kiriath Baal (the same is Kiriath
Jearim), a city of the children of Judah. This was the west quarter.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,15);</script>The south quarter was
from the farthest part of Kiriath Jearim. The border went out westward,
and went out to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,16);</script>The border went down to the
farthest part of the mountain that lies before the valley of the son of
Hinnom, which is in the valley of Rephaim northward. It went down to the
valley of Hinnom, to the side of the Jebusite southward, and went down to
En Rogel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,17);</script>It extended
northward, went out at En Shemesh, and went out to Geliloth, which is over
against the ascent of Adummim. It went down to the stone of Bohan the son
of Reuben. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,18);</script>It passed
along to the side over against the Arabah northward, and went down to the
Arabah. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,19);</script>The border
passed along to the side of Beth Hoglah northward; and the border ended at
the north bay of the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Jordan. This was
the south border. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,20);</script>The
Jordan was its border on the east quarter. This was the inheritance of the
children of Benjamin, by the borders around it, according to their
families. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,21);</script>Now the cities
of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were
Jericho, Beth Hoglah, Emek Keziz, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,22);</script>Beth Arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,23);</script>Avvim, Parah, Ophrah,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,24);</script>Chephar Ammoni, Ophni,
and Geba; twelve cities with their villages. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,25);</script>Gibeon, Ramah, Beeroth, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,26);</script>Mizpeh, Chephirah, Mozah,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,27);</script>Rekem, Irpeel, Taralah,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,28);</script>Zelah, Eleph, the
Jebusite (the same is Jerusalem), Gibeath, and Kiriath; fourteen cities
with their villages. This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin
according to their families.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,1);</script>The second lot came
out for Simeon, even for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to
their families. Their inheritance was in the midst of the inheritance of
the children of Judah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,2);</script>They had for their inheritance
Beersheba (or Sheba), Moladah, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,3);</script>Hazar Shual, Balah, Ezem, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,4);</script>Eltolad, Bethul, Hormah, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,5);</script>Ziklag, Beth Marcaboth, Hazar
Susah, <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,6);</script>Beth Lebaoth, and
Sharuhen; thirteen cities with their villages; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,7);</script>Ain, Rimmon, Ether, and Ashan;
four cities with their villages; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,8);</script>and all the villages that were
around these cities to Baalath Beer, Ramah of the South. This is the
inheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their
families. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,9);</script>Out of the part
of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon;
for the portion of the children of Judah was too much for them. Therefore
the children of Simeon had inheritance in the midst of their inheritance.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,10);</script>The third lot came up
for the children of Zebulun according to their families. The border of
their inheritance was to Sarid. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,11);</script>Their border went up westward,
even to Maralah, and reached to Dabbesheth. It reached to the brook that
is before Jokneam. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,12);</script>It
turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrise to the border of Chisloth
Tabor. It went out to Daberath, and went up to Japhia. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,13);</script>From there it passed along
eastward to Gath Hepher, to Ethkazin; and it went out at Rimmon which
stretches to Neah. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,14);</script>The
border turned around it on the north to Hannathon; and it ended at the
valley of Iphtah El; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,15);</script>Kattath, Nahalal, Shimron,
Idalah, and Bethlehem: twelve cities with their villages. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,16);</script>This is the inheritance of the
children of Zebulun according to their families, these cities with their
villages.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,17);</script>The fourth lot came
out for Issachar, even for the children of Issachar according to their
families. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,18);</script>Their border
was to Jezreel, Chesulloth, Shunem, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,19);</script>Hapharaim, Shion, Anaharath,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(19,20);</script>Rabbith, Kishion, Ebez,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(19,21);</script>Remeth, Engannim, En
Haddah, and Beth Pazzez. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,22);</script>The border reached to Tabor,
Shahazumah, and Beth Shemesh. Their border ended at the Jordan: sixteen
cities with their villages. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,23);</script>This is the inheritance of the
tribe of the children of Issachar according to their families, the cities
with their villages.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,24);</script>The fifth lot came
out for the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(19,25);</script>Their border was
Helkath, Hali, Beten, Achshaph, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,26);</script>Allammelech, Amad, Mishal. It
reached to Carmel westward, and to Shihorlibnath. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,27);</script>It turned toward the sunrise to
Beth Dagon, and reached to Zebulun, and to the valley of Iphtah El
northward to Beth Emek and Neiel. It went out to Cabul on the left hand,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(19,28);</script>and Ebron, Rehob,
Hammon, and Kanah, even to great Sidon. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,29);</script>The border turned to Ramah, to
the fortified city of Tyre; and the border turned to Hosah. It ended at
the sea by the region of Achzib; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,30);</script>Ummah also, and Aphek, and
Rehob: twenty-two cities with their villages. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,31);</script>This is the inheritance of the
tribe of the children of Asher according to their families, these cities
with their villages.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,32);</script>The sixth lot came
out for the children of Naphtali, even for the children of Naphtali
according to their families. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,33);</script>Their border was from Heleph,
from the oak in Zaanannim, Adaminekeb, and Jabneel, to Lakkum. It ended at
the Jordan. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,34);</script>The border
turned westward to Aznoth Tabor, and went out from there to Hukkok. It
reached to Zebulun on the south, and reached to Asher on the west, and to
Judah at the Jordan toward the sunrise. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,35);</script>The fortified cities were
Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, Chinnereth, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,36);</script>Adamah, Ramah, Hazor, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,37);</script>Kedesh, Edrei, En Hazor, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,38);</script>Iron, Migdal El, Horem, Beth
Anath, and Beth Shemesh; nineteen cities with their villages. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,39);</script>This is the inheritance of the
tribe of the children of Naphtali according to their families, the cities
with their villages.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,40);</script>The seventh lot came
out for the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(19,41);</script>The border of their
inheritance was Zorah, Eshtaol, Irshemesh, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,42);</script>Shaalabbin, Aijalon, Ithlah,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(19,43);</script>Elon, Timnah, Ekron,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(19,44);</script>Eltekeh, Gibbethon,
Baalath, <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,45);</script>Jehud, Bene
Berak, Gath Rimmon, <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,46);</script>Me
Jarkon, and Rakkon, with the border over against Joppa. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,47);</script>The border of the children of
Dan went out beyond them; for the children of Dan went up and fought
against Leshem, and took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and
possessed it, and lived therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of
Dan their father. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,48);</script>This
is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their
families, these cities with their villages.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,49);</script>So they made an end
of distributing the land for inheritance by its borders. The children of
Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun in their midst.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(19,50);</script>According to the
commandment of Yahweh, they gave him the city which he asked, even
Timnathserah in the hill country of Ephraim; and he built the city, and
lived there. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,51);</script>These are
the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the
heads of the fathers’ houses of the tribes of the children of Israel,
distributed for inheritance by lot in Shiloh before Yahweh, at the door of
the Tent of Meeting. So they made an end of dividing the land.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,1);</script>Yahweh spoke to
Joshua, saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,2);</script>“Speak
to the children of Israel, saying, ‘Assign the cities of refuge, of
which I spoke to you by Moses, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,3);</script>that the manslayer who kills any
person accidentally or unintentionally may flee there. They shall be to
you for a refuge from the avenger of blood. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,4);</script>He shall flee to one of those
cities, and shall stand at the entrance of the gate of the city, and
declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city. They shall take
him into the city with them, and give him a place, that he may live among
them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,5);</script>If the avenger of
blood pursue after him, then they shall not deliver up the manslayer into
his hand; because he struck his neighbor unintentionally, and didn’t
hate him before. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,6);</script>He shall
dwell in that city until he stands before the congregation for judgment,
until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days. Then the
manslayer shall return, and come to his own city, and to his own house, to
the city he fled from.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,7);</script>They set apart Kedesh
in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali, Shechem in the hill country of
Ephraim, and Kiriath Arba (the same is Hebron) in the hill country of
Judah. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,8);</script>Beyond the Jordan
at Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness in the plain
out of the tribe of Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and
Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,9);</script>These were the appointed cities
for all the children of Israel, and for the alien who lives among them,
that whoever kills any person unintentionally might flee there, and not
die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stands before the
congregation.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,1);</script>Then the heads of
fathers’ houses of the Levites came near to Eleazar the priest, and to
Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of fathers’ houses of the tribes
of the children of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,2);</script>They spoke to them at Shiloh in
the land of Canaan, saying, “Yahweh commanded Moses to give us cities to
dwell in, with their suburbs for our livestock.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,3);</script>The children of Israel
gave to the Levites out of their inheritance, according to the commandment
of Yahweh, these cities with their suburbs. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,4);</script>The lot came out for the families
of the Kohathites. The children of Aaron the priest, who were of the
Levites, had thirteen cities by lot out of the tribe of Judah, out of the
tribe of the Simeonites, and out of the tribe of Benjamin. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,5);</script>The rest of the children of
Kohath had ten cities by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim,
out of the tribe of Dan, and out of the half-tribe of Manasseh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,6);</script>The children of Gershon had
thirteen cities by lot out of the families of the tribe of Issachar, out
of the tribe of Asher, out of the tribe of Naphtali, and out of the
half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,7);</script>The children of Merari according
to their families had twelve cities out of the tribe of Reuben, out of the
tribe of Gad, and out of the tribe of Zebulun. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,8);</script>The children of Israel gave these
cities with their suburbs by lot to the Levites, as Yahweh commanded by
Moses. <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,9);</script>They gave out of
the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of the tribe of the children
of Simeon, these cities which are mentioned by name: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,10);</script>and they were for the children
of Aaron, of the families of the Kohathites, who were of the children of
Levi; for theirs was the first lot. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,11);</script>They gave them Kiriath Arba,
named after the father of Anak (the same is Hebron), in the hill country
of Judah, with its suburbs around it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,12);</script>But they gave the fields of the
city and its villages to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(21,13);</script>To the children of Aaron
the priest they gave Hebron with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the
manslayer, Libnah with its suburbs, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,14);</script>Jattir with its suburbs,
Eshtemoa with its suburbs, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,15);</script>Holon with its suburbs, Debir
with its suburbs, <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,16);</script>Ain
with its suburbs, Juttah with its suburbs, and Beth Shemesh with its
suburbs; nine cities out of those two tribes. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,17);</script>Out of the tribe of Benjamin,
Gibeon with its suburbs, Geba with its suburbs, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,18);</script>Anathoth with its suburbs, and
Almon with its suburbs; four cities. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,19);</script>All the cities of the children
of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities with their suburbs.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,20);</script>The families of the
children of Kohath, the Levites, even the rest of the children of Kohath,
had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,21);</script>They gave them Shechem with its
suburbs in the hill country of Ephraim, the city of refuge for the
manslayer, and Gezer with its suburbs, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,22);</script>Kibzaim with its suburbs, and
Beth Horon with its suburbs; four cities. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,23);</script>Out of the tribe of Dan, Elteke
with its suburbs, Gibbethon with its suburbs, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,24);</script>Aijalon with its suburbs, Gath
Rimmon with its suburbs; four cities. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,25);</script>Out of the half-tribe of
Manasseh, Taanach with its suburbs, and Gath Rimmon with its suburbs; two
cities. <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,26);</script>All the cities
of the families of the rest of the children of Kohath were ten with their
suburbs.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,27);</script>They gave to the
children of Gershon, of the families of the Levites, out of the half-tribe
of Manasseh Golan in Bashan with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the
manslayer, and Be Eshterah with its suburbs; two cities. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,28);</script>Out of the tribe of Issachar,
Kishion with its suburbs, Daberath with its suburbs, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,29);</script>Jarmuth with its suburbs, En
Gannim with its suburbs; four cities. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,30);</script>Out of the tribe of Asher,
Mishal with its suburbs, Abdon with its suburbs, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,31);</script>Helkath with its suburbs, and
Rehob with its suburbs; four cities. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,32);</script>Out of the tribe of Naphtali,
Kedesh in Galilee with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer,
Hammothdor with its suburbs, and Kartan with its suburbs; three cities.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(21,33);</script>All the cities of the
Gershonites according to their families were thirteen cities with their
suburbs.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,34);</script>To the families of
the children of Merari, the rest of the Levites, out of the tribe of
Zebulun, Jokneam with its suburbs, Kartah with its suburbs, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,35);</script>Dimnah with its suburbs, and
Nahalal with its suburbs; four cities. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,36);</script>Out of the tribe of Reuben,
Bezer with its suburbs, Jahaz with its suburbs, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,37);</script>Kedemoth with its suburbs, and
Mephaath with its suburbs; four cities. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,38);</script>Out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth
in Gilead with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and
Mahanaim with its suburbs, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,39);</script>Heshbon with its suburbs, Jazer
with its suburbs; four cities in all. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,40);</script>All these were the cities of the
children of Merari according to their families, even the rest of the
families of the Levites. Their lot was twelve cities.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,41);</script>All the cities of the
Levites in the midst of the possession of the children of Israel were
forty-eight cities with their suburbs. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,42);</script>Each of these cities included
their suburbs around them. It was this way with all these cities.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,43);</script>So Yahweh gave to
Israel all the land which he swore to give to their fathers. They
possessed it, and lived in it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,44);</script>Yahweh gave them rest all
around, according to all that he swore to their fathers. Not a man of all
their enemies stood before them. Yahweh delivered all their enemies into
their hand. <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,45);</script>Nothing
failed of any good thing which Yahweh had spoken to the house of Israel.
All came to pass.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,1);</script>Then Joshua called the
Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,2);</script>and said to them, “You have
kept all that Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded you, and have listened
to my voice in all that I commanded you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,3);</script>You have not left your brothers
these many days to this day, but have performed the duty of the
commandment of Yahweh your God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,4);</script>Now Yahweh your God has given
rest to your brothers, as he spoke to them. Therefore now return and go to
your tents, to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of
Yahweh gave you beyond the Jordan. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,5);</script>Only take diligent heed to do the
commandment and the law which Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded you,
to love Yahweh your God, to walk in all his ways, to keep his
commandments, to hold fast to him, and to serve him with all your heart
and with all your soul.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,6);</script>So Joshua blessed
them, and sent them away; and they went to their tents. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,7);</script>Now to the one half-tribe of
Manasseh Moses had given inheritance in Bashan; but to the other half gave
Joshua among their brothers beyond the Jordan westward. Moreover when
Joshua sent them away to their tents, he blessed them, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,8);</script>and spoke to them, saying,
“Return with much wealth to your tents, with very much livestock, with
silver, with gold, with brass, with iron, and with very much clothing.
Divide the spoil of your enemies with your brothers.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,9);</script>The children of Reuben
and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned, and
departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land
of Canaan, to go to the land of Gilead, to the land of their possession,
which they owned, according to the commandment of Yahweh by Moses. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,10);</script>When they came to the region
about the Jordan, that is in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben
and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an
altar by the Jordan, a great altar to look at. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,11);</script>The children of Israel heard
this, “Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the
half-tribe of Manasseh have built an altar in the forefront of the land of
Canaan, in the region about the Jordan, on the side that pertains to the
children of Israel.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,12);</script>When the children of Israel
heard of it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered
themselves together at Shiloh, to go up against them to war. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,13);</script>The children of Israel sent to
the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe
of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the
priest, <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,14);</script>and with him ten
princes, one prince of a fathers’ house for each of the tribes of
Israel; and they were everyone of them head of their fathers’ houses
among the thousands of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,15);</script>They came to the children of
Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, to
the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,16);</script>“Thus says the whole
congregation of Yahweh, ‘What trespass is this that you have committed
against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following Yahweh, in
that you have built yourselves an altar, to rebel this day against Yahweh?
<script type="text/javascript">cb(22,17);</script>Is the iniquity of Peor
too little for us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves to this day,
although there came a plague on the congregation of Yahweh, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,18);</script>that you must turn away this day
from following Yahweh? It will be, since you rebel today against Yahweh,
that tomorrow he will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(22,19);</script>However, if the land of
your possession is unclean, then pass over to the land of the possession
of Yahweh, in which Yahweh’s tabernacle dwells, and take possession
among us; but don’t rebel against Yahweh, nor rebel against us, in
building an altar other than the altar of Yahweh our God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,20);</script>Didn’t Achan the son of Zerah
commit a trespass in the devoted thing, and wrath fell on all the
congregation of Israel? That man didn’t perish alone in his
iniquity.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,21);</script>Then the children of
Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered,
and spoke to the heads of the thousands of Israel, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,22);</script>“The Mighty One, God, Yahweh,
the Mighty One, God, Yahweh, he knows; and Israel shall know: if it was in
rebellion, or if in trespass against Yahweh (don’t save us this day),
<script type="text/javascript">cb(22,23);</script>that we have built us an
altar to turn away from following Yahweh; or if to offer burnt offering or
meal offering, or if to offer sacrifices of peace offerings, let Yahweh
himself require it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,24);</script>“If we have not out
of concern done this, and for a reason, saying, ‘In time to come your
children might speak to our children, saying, “What have you to do with
Yahweh, the God of Israel? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,25);</script>For Yahweh has made the Jordan a
border between us and you, you children of Reuben and children of Gad. You
have no portion in Yahweh.”’ So your children might make our children
cease from fearing Yahweh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,26);</script>“Therefore we said,
‘Let’s now prepare to build ourselves an altar, not for burnt
offering, nor for sacrifice; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,27);</script>but it will be a witness between
us and you, and between our generations after us, that we may perform the
service of Yahweh before him with our burnt offerings, with our
sacrifices, and with our peace offerings;’ that your children may not
tell our children in time to come, ‘You have no portion in Yahweh.’
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,28);</script>“Therefore we said,
‘It shall be, when they tell us or our generations this in time to come,
that we shall say, “Behold the pattern of the altar of Yahweh, which our
fathers made, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice; but it is a
witness between us and you.”’
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,29);</script>“Far be it from us
that we should rebel against Yahweh, and turn away this day from following
Yahweh, to build an altar for burnt offering, for meal offering, or for
sacrifice, besides the altar of Yahweh our God that is before his
tabernacle!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,30);</script>When Phinehas the
priest, and the princes of the congregation, even the heads of the
thousands of Israel that were with him, heard the words that the children
of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spoke, it
pleased them well. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,31);</script>Phinehas the son of Eleazar the
priest said to the children of Reuben, to the children of Gad, and to the
children of Manasseh, “Today we know that Yahweh is in the midst of us,
because you have not committed this trespass against Yahweh. Now you have
delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of Yahweh.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,32);</script>Phinehas the son of Eleazar the
priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from
the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, to the land of Canaan, to
the children of Israel, and brought them word again. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,33);</script>The thing pleased the children
of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and spoke no more of
going up against them to war, to destroy the land in which the children of
Reuben and the children of Gad lived. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,34);</script>The children of Reuben and the
children of Gad named the altar “A Witness Between Us that Yahweh is
God.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,1);</script>It happened after many
days, when Yahweh had given rest to Israel from their enemies all around,
and Joshua was old and well advanced in years, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,2);</script>that Joshua called for all
Israel, for their elders and for their heads, and for their judges and for
their officers, and said to them, “I am old and well advanced in years.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(23,3);</script>You have seen all that
Yahweh your God has done to all these nations because of you; for it is
Yahweh your God who has fought for you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,4);</script>Behold, I have allotted to you
these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from the
Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even to the great sea
toward the going down of the sun. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,5);</script>Yahweh your God will thrust them
out from before you, and drive them from out of your sight. You shall
possess their land, as Yahweh your God spoke to you.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,6);</script>“Therefore be very
courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of
Moses, that you not turn aside from it to the right hand or to the left;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(23,7);</script>that you not come among
these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the
name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor
bow down yourselves to them; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,8);</script>but hold fast to Yahweh your God,
as you have done to this day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,9);</script>“For Yahweh has
driven great and strong nations out from before you. But as for you, no
man has stood before you to this day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,10);</script>One man of you shall chase a
thousand; for it is Yahweh your God who fights for you, as he spoke to
you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,11);</script>Take good heed
therefore to yourselves, that you love Yahweh your God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,12);</script>“But if you do at
all go back, and hold fast to the remnant of these nations, even these who
remain among you, and make marriages with them, and go in to them, and
they to you; <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,13);</script>know for a
certainty that Yahweh your God will no longer drive these nations from out
of your sight; but they shall be a snare and a trap to you, a scourge in
your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from off this good
land which Yahweh your God has given you.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,14);</script>“Behold, today I am
going the way of all the earth. You know in all your hearts and in all
your souls that not one thing has failed of all the good things which
Yahweh your God spoke concerning you. All have happened to you. Not one
thing has failed of it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,15);</script>It shall happen that as all the
good things have come on you of which Yahweh your God spoke to you, so
Yahweh will bring on you all the evil things, until he has destroyed you
from off this good land which Yahweh your God has given you, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,16);</script>when you disobey the covenant of
Yahweh your God, which he commanded you, and go and serve other gods, and
bow down yourselves to them. Then the anger of Yahweh will  be kindled
against you, and you will perish quickly from off the good land which he
has given to you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,1);</script>Joshua gathered all
the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, for
their heads, for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented
themselves before God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,2);</script>Joshua said to all the people,
“Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, ‘Your fathers lived of old time
beyond the River, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of
Nahor: and they served other gods. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,3);</script>I took your father Abraham from
beyond the River, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and
multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,4);</script>I gave to Isaac Jacob and Esau:
and I gave to Esau Mount Seir, to possess it. Jacob and his children went
down into Egypt.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,5);</script>“‘I sent Moses and
Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did in its midst:
and afterward I brought you out. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,6);</script>I brought your fathers out of
Egypt: and you came to the sea. The Egyptians pursued after your fathers
with chariots and with horsemen to the <a href="#N7">Red Sea</a>. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,7);</script>When they cried out to Yahweh, he
put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea on them,
and covered them; and your eyes saw what I did in Egypt: and you lived in
the wilderness many days.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,8);</script>“‘I brought you
into the land of the Amorites, that lived beyond the Jordan: and they
fought with you; and I gave them into your hand. You possessed their land;
and I destroyed them from before you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,9);</script>Then Balak the son of Zippor,
king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel. He sent and called Balaam
the son of Beor to curse you; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,10);</script>but I would not listen to
Balaam; therefore he blessed you still. So I delivered you out of his hand.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,11);</script>“‘You went over
the Jordan, and came to Jericho. The men of Jericho fought against you,
the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Girgashite,
the Hivite, and the Jebusite; and I delivered them into your hand. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,12);</script>I sent the hornet before you,
which drove them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites;
not with your sword, nor with your bow. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,13);</script>I gave you a land whereon you
had not labored, and cities which you didn’t build, and you live in
them. You eat of vineyards and olive groves which you didn’t plant.’
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,14);</script>“Now therefore fear
Yahweh, and serve him in sincerity and in truth. Put away the gods which
your fathers served beyond the River, in Egypt; and serve Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,15);</script>If it seems evil to you to serve
Yahweh, choose this day whom you will serve; whether the gods which your
fathers served that were beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in
whose land you dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve Yahweh.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,16);</script>The people answered,
“Far be it from us that we should forsake Yahweh, to serve other gods;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(24,17);</script>for it is Yahweh our God
who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, from the house
of bondage, and who did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us
in all the way in which we went, and among all the peoples through the
midst of whom we passed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,18);</script>Yahweh drove out from before us
all the peoples, even the Amorites who lived in the land. Therefore we
also will serve Yahweh; for he is our God.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,19);</script>Joshua said to the
people, “You can’t serve Yahweh; for he is a holy God. He is a jealous
God. He will not forgive your disobedience nor your sins. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,20);</script>If you forsake Yahweh, and serve
foreign gods, then he will turn and do you evil, and consume you, after he
has done you good.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,21);</script>The people said to
Joshua, “No; but we will serve Yahweh.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,22);</script>Joshua said to the people,
“You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen Yahweh
yourselves, to serve him.”
<p>They said, “We are witnesses.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,23);</script>“Now therefore put
away the foreign gods which are among you, and incline your heart to
Yahweh, the God of Israel.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,24);</script>The people said to
Joshua, “We will serve Yahweh our God, and we will listen to his
voice.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,25);</script>So Joshua made a
covenant with the people that day, and made for them a statute and an
ordinance in Shechem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,26);</script>Joshua wrote these words in the
book of the law of God; and he took a great stone, and set it up there
under the oak that was by the sanctuary of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,27);</script>Joshua said to all the people,
“Behold, this stone shall be a witness against us; for it has heard all
the words of Yahweh which he spoke to us. It shall be therefore a witness
against you, lest you deny your God.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,28);</script>So Joshua sent the people away,
every man to his inheritance.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,29);</script>It happened after
these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Yahweh, died,
being one hundred and ten years old. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,30);</script>They buried him in the border of
his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim,
on the north of the mountain of Gaash. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,31);</script>Israel served Yahweh all the
days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, and
had known all the work of Yahweh, that he had worked for Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,32);</script>They buried the bones of Joseph,
which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, in Shechem, in the
parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of
Shechem for a hundred pieces of money. They became the inheritance of the
children of Joseph. <script
