Judges
</h1><p>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,1);</script>It happened after the
death of Joshua, the children of Israel asked of <a href="#N1">Yahweh,</a>
saying, “Who should go up for us first against the Canaanites, to fight
against them?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,2);</script>Yahweh said, “Judah
shall go up. Behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,3);</script>Judah said to Simeon
his brother, “Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the
Canaanites; and I likewise will go with you into your lot.” So Simeon
went with him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,4);</script>Judah went
up; and Yahweh delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their
hand: and they struck of them in Bezek ten thousand men. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,5);</script>They found Adoni-Bezek in Bezek;
and they fought against him, and they struck the Canaanites and the
Perizzites. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,6);</script>But
Adoni-Bezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off
his thumbs and his great toes. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,7);</script>Adoni-Bezek said, “Seventy
kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, scavenged under
my table: as I have done, so <a href="#N2">God</a> has requited me.”
They brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,8);</script>The children of Judah fought
against Jerusalem, and took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword,
and set the city on fire. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,9);</script>Afterward the children of Judah
went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the hill country,
and in the South, and in the lowland. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,10);</script>Judah went against the Canaanites
who lived in Hebron (now the name of Hebron before was Kiriath Arba); and
they struck Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,11);</script>From there he went
against the inhabitants of Debir. (Now the name of Debir before was
Kiriath Sepher.) <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,12);</script>Caleb
said, “He who strikes Kiriath Sepher, and takes it, to him will I give
Achsah my daughter as wife.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,13);</script>Othniel the son of Kenaz,
Caleb’s younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter as
wife.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,14);</script>It happened, when she
came, that she got him to ask her father for a field: and she alighted
from off her donkey; and Caleb said to her, “What would you like?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,15);</script>She said to him,
“Give me a blessing; for that you have set me in the land of the South,
give me also springs of water.” Then Caleb gave her the upper springs
and the lower springs. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,16);</script>The children of the Kenite,
Moses’ brother-in-law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the
children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which is in the south of
Arad; and they went and lived with the people. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,17);</script>Judah went with Simeon his
brother, and they struck the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath, and utterly
destroyed it. The name of the city was called Hormah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,18);</script>Also Judah took Gaza with its
border, and Ashkelon with its border, and Ekron with its border. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,19);</script>Yahweh was with Judah; and drove
out the inhabitants of the hill country; for he could not drive out the
inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,20);</script>They gave Hebron to Caleb, as
Moses had spoken: and he drove out there the three sons of Anak. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,21);</script>The children of Benjamin did not
drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell
with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,22);</script>The house of Joseph,
they also went up against Bethel; and Yahweh was with them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,23);</script>The house of Joseph sent to spy
out Bethel. (Now the name of the city before was Luz.) <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,24);</script>The watchers saw a man come forth
out of the city, and they said to him, “Please show us the entrance into
the city, and we will deal kindly with you.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,25);</script>He showed them the entrance into
the city; and they struck the city with the edge of the sword; but they
let the man go and all his family. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,26);</script>The man went into the land of the
Hittites, and built a city, and called its name Luz, which is its name to
this day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,27);</script>Manasseh did not drive
out the inhabitants of Beth Shean and its towns, nor Taanach and its
towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, nor the inhabitants of
Ibleam and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; but
the Canaanites would dwell in that land. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,28);</script>It happened, when Israel had
grown strong, that they put the Canaanites to forced labor, and did not
utterly drive them out. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,29);</script>Ephraim didn’t drive out the
Canaanites who lived in Gezer; but the Canaanites lived in Gezer among
them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,30);</script>Zebulun didn’t
drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but
the Canaanites lived among them, and became subject to forced labor.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,31);</script>Asher didn’t drive out
the inhabitants of Acco, nor the inhabitants of Sidon, nor of Ahlab, nor
of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,32);</script>but the Asherites lived among the
Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not drive them out.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,33);</script>Naphtali didn’t drive
out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth Anath;
but he lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land:
nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and of Beth Anath became
subject to forced labor. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,34);</script>The Amorites forced the children
of Dan into the hill country; for they would not allow them to come down
to the valley; <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,35);</script>but the
Amorites would dwell in Mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the
hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became subject to
forced labor. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,36);</script>The border
of the Amorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,1);</script>The angel of Yahweh
came up from Gilgal to Bochim. He said, “I made you to go up out of
Egypt, and have brought you to the land which I swore to your fathers; and
I said, ‘I will never break my covenant with you: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,2);</script>and you shall make no covenant
with the inhabitants of this land; you shall break down their altars.’
But you have not listened to my voice: why have you done this? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,3);</script>Therefore I also said, I will not
drive them out from before you; but they shall be in your sides, and their
gods shall be a snare to you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,4);</script>It happened, when the
angel of Yahweh spoke these words to all the children of Israel, that the
people lifted up their voice, and wept. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,5);</script>They called the name of that place
Bochim: and they sacrificed there to Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,6);</script>Now when Joshua had sent the
people away, the children of Israel went every man to his inheritance to
possess the land. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,7);</script>The
people served Yahweh all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the
elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of Yahweh that
he had worked for Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,8);</script>Joshua the son of Nun, the servant
of Yahweh, died, being one hundred ten years old. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,9);</script>They buried him in the border of
his inheritance in Timnath Heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, on the
north of the mountain of Gaash. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,10);</script>Also all that generation were
gathered to their fathers: and there arose another generation after them,
who didn’t know Yahweh, nor yet the work which he had worked for Israel.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,11);</script>The children of Israel
did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and served the Baals;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,12);</script>and they forsook Yahweh,
the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and
followed other gods, of the gods of the peoples who were around them, and
bowed themselves down to them: and they provoked Yahweh to anger. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,13);</script>They forsook Yahweh, and served
Baal and the Ashtaroth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,14);</script>The anger of Yahweh was kindled
against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers who
despoiled them; and he sold them into the hands of their enemies all
around, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,15);</script>Wherever they went out,
the hand of Yahweh was against them for evil, as Yahweh had spoken, and as
Yahweh had sworn to them: and they were very distressed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,16);</script>Yahweh raised up judges, who
saved them out of the hand of those who despoiled them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,17);</script>Yet they didn’t listen to their
judges; for they played the prostitute after other gods, and bowed
themselves down to them: they turned aside quickly out of the way in which
their fathers walked, obeying the commandments of Yahweh. They didn’t do
so. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,18);</script>When Yahweh raised
them up judges, then Yahweh was with the judge, and saved them out of the
hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it grieved Yahweh
because of their groaning by reason of those who oppressed them and
troubled them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,19);</script>But it
happened, when the judge was dead, that they turned back, and dealt more
corruptly than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and
to bow down to them; they didn’t cease from their doings, nor from their
stubborn way. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,20);</script>The anger
of Yahweh was kindled against Israel; and he said, “Because this nation
have transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have
not listened to my voice; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,21);</script>I also will not henceforth drive
out any from before them of the nations that Joshua left when he died;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,22);</script>that by them I may prove
Israel, whether they will keep the way of Yahweh to walk therein, as their
fathers kept it, or not.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,23);</script>So Yahweh left those nations,
without driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand
of Joshua.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,1);</script>Now these are the
nations which Yahweh left, to prove Israel by them, even as many as had
not known all the wars of Canaan; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,2);</script>only that the generations of the
children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as
before knew nothing of it: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,3);</script>the five lords of the Philistines,
and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites who lived on
Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal Hermon to the entrance of Hamath. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,4);</script>They were left to test Israel by
them, to know whether they would listen to the commandments of Yahweh,
which he commanded their fathers by Moses. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,5);</script>The children of Israel lived among
the Canaanites, the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and
the Hivites, and the Jebusites: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,6);</script>and they took their daughters to
be their wives, and gave their own daughters to their sons and served
their gods. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,7);</script>The children
of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and forgot
Yahweh their God, and served the Baals and the Asheroth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,8);</script>Therefore the anger of Yahweh was
kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushan
Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Cushan
Rishathaim eight years. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,9);</script>When the children of Israel cried
to Yahweh, Yahweh raised up a savior to the children of Israel, who saved
them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,10);</script>The Spirit of Yahweh came on him,
and he judged Israel; and he went out to war, and Yahweh delivered Cushan
Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand: and his hand prevailed
against Cushan Rishathaim. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,11);</script>The land had rest forty years.
Othniel the son of Kenaz died. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,12);</script>The children of Israel again did
that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh: and Yahweh strengthened Eglon
the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done that which was evil
in the sight of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,13);</script>He gathered to him the children
of Ammon and Amalek; and he went and struck Israel, and they possessed the
city of palm trees. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,14);</script>The
children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,15);</script>But when the children of Israel
cried to Yahweh, Yahweh raised them up a savior, Ehud the son of Gera, the
Benjamite, a man left-handed. The children of Israel sent tribute by him
to Eglon the king of Moab. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,16);</script>Ehud made him a sword which had
two edges, a cubit in length; and he wore it under his clothing on his
right thigh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,17);</script>He offered
the tribute to Eglon king of Moab: now Eglon was a very fat man. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,18);</script>When he had made an end of
offering the tribute, he sent away the people who bore the tribute.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,19);</script>But he himself turned
back from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, “I have a secret
errand to you, king.”
<p>The king said, “Keep silence!” All who stood by him went out from
him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,20);</script>Ehud came to him; and
he was sitting by himself alone in the cool upper room. Ehud said, “I
have a message from God to you.” He arose out of his seat. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,21);</script>Ehud put forth his left hand, and
took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his body: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,22);</script>and the handle also went in after
the blade; and the fat closed on the blade, for he didn’t draw the sword
out of his body; and it came out behind. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,23);</script>Then Ehud went forth into the
porch, and shut the doors of the upper room on him, and locked them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,24);</script>Now when he was gone
out, his servants came; and they saw, and behold, the doors of the upper
room were locked; and they said, “Surely he is covering his feet in the
upper room.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,25);</script>They
waited until they were ashamed; and behold, he didn’t open the doors of
the upper room: therefore they took the key, and opened them, and behold,
their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,26);</script>Ehud escaped while
they waited, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped to Seirah.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,27);</script>It happened, when he had
come, that he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim; and the
children of Israel went down with him from the hill country, and he before
them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,28);</script>He said to them,
“Follow me; for Yahweh has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your
hand.” They followed him, and took the fords of the Jordan against the
Moabites, and didn’t allow any man to pass over. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,29);</script>They struck of Moab at that time
about ten thousand men, every lusty man, and every man of valor; and there
escaped not a man. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,30);</script>So
Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. The land had rest
eighty years.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,31);</script>After him was Shamgar
the son of Anath, who struck of the Philistines six hundred men with an
oxgoad: and he also saved Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,1);</script>The children of Israel
again did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, when Ehud was dead.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,2);</script>Yahweh sold them into the
hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose
army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth of the Gentiles. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,3);</script>The children of Israel cried to
Yahweh: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he
mightily oppressed the children of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,4);</script>Now Deborah, a prophetess, the
wife of Lappidoth, she judged Israel at that time. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,5);</script>She lived under the palm tree of
Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim: and the
children of Israel came up to her for judgment. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,6);</script>She sent and called Barak the son
of Abinoam out of Kedesh Naphtali, and said to him, “Hasn’t Yahweh,
the God of Israel, commanded, ‘Go and draw to Mount Tabor, and take with
you ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of
Zebulun? <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,7);</script>I will draw to
you, to the river Kishon, Sisera, the captain of Jabin’s army, with his
chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into your hand.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,8);</script>Barak said to her,
“If you will go with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me,
I will not go.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,9);</script>She said, “I will
surely go with you: nevertheless, the journey that you take shall not be
for your honor; for Yahweh will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman.”
Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,10);</script>Barak called Zebulun
and Naphtali together to Kedesh; and there went up ten thousand men at his
feet: and Deborah went up with him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,11);</script>Now Heber the Kenite had
separated himself from the Kenites, even from the children of Hobab the
brother-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in
Zaanannim, which is by Kedesh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,12);</script>They told Sisera that Barak the
son of Abinoam was gone up to Mount Tabor. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,13);</script>Sisera gathered together all his
chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people who were
with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles, to the river Kishon.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,14);</script>Deborah said to Barak,
“Go; for this is the day in which Yahweh has delivered Sisera into your
hand. Hasn’t Yahweh gone out before you?” So Barak went down from
Mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,15);</script>Yahweh confused Sisera, and all
his chariots, and all his army, with the edge of the sword before Barak;
and Sisera alighted from his chariot, and fled away on his feet. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,16);</script>But Barak pursued after the
chariots, and after the army, to Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the
army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; there was not a man left.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,17);</script>However Sisera fled
away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite; for
there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the
Kenite. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,18);</script>Jael went out to
meet Sisera, and said to him, “Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; don’t
be afraid.” He came in to her into the tent, and she covered him with a
rug.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,19);</script>He said to her,
“Please give me a little water to drink; for I am thirsty.”
<p>She opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,20);</script>He said to her,
“Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man comes and
inquires of you, and says, ‘Is there any man here?’ that you shall
say, ‘No.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,21);</script>Then Jael Heber’s
wife took a tent peg, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to
him, and struck the pin into his temples, and it pierced through into the
ground; for he was in a deep sleep; so he swooned and died. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,22);</script>Behold, as Barak pursued Sisera,
Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, “Come, and I will show you
the man whom you seek.” He came to her; and behold, Sisera lay dead, and
the tent peg was in his temples. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,23);</script>So God subdued on that day Jabin
the king of Canaan before the children of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,24);</script>The hand of the children of
Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin the king of Canaan, until
they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.
<p> <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,1);</script>Then Deborah and Barak
the son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying,
<dl>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,2);</script>“Because the leaders
took the lead in Israel,
<dd>because the people offered themselves willingly,
<dt>be blessed, Yahweh!
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,3);</script>“Hear, you kings!
<dd>Give ear, you princes!
<dt>I, even I, will sing to Yahweh.
<dd>I will sing praise to Yahweh, the God of Israel.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,4);</script>“Yahweh, when you
went forth out of Seir,
<dd>when you marched out of the field of Edom,
<dt>the earth trembled, the sky also dropped.
<dd>Yes, the clouds dropped water.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,5);</script>The mountains quaked
at the presence of Yahweh,
<dd>even Sinai, at the presence of Yahweh, the God of Israel.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,6);</script>“In the days of
Shamgar the son of Anath,
<dd>in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied.
<dd>The travelers walked through byways.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,7);</script>The rulers ceased in
Israel.
<dd>They ceased until I, Deborah, arose;
<dd>Until I arose a mother in Israel.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,8);</script>They chose new gods.
<dd>Then war was in the gates.
<dd>Was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,9);</script>My heart is toward the
governors of Israel,
<dd>who offered themselves willingly among the people.
<dd>Bless Yahweh!
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,10);</script>“Speak, you who
ride on white donkeys,
<dd>you who sit on rich carpets,
<dd>and you who walk by the way.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,11);</script>Far from the noise of
archers, in the places of drawing water,
<dd>there they will rehearse the righteous acts of Yahweh,
<dd>the righteous acts of his rule in Israel.
<dt>
<dt>“Then the people of Yahweh went down to the gates.
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,12);</script>‘Awake, awake,
Deborah!
<dd>Awake, awake, utter a song!
<dd>Arise, Barak, and lead away your captives, you son of Abinoam.’
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,13);</script>“Then a remnant of
the nobles and the people came down.

</dl>
<p>Then the land had rest forty years.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,1);</script>The children of Israel
did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh: and Yahweh delivered them
into the hand of Midian seven years. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,2);</script>The hand of Midian prevailed
against Israel; and because of Midian the children of Israel made them the
dens which are in the mountains, and the caves, and the strongholds.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(6,3);</script>So it was, when Israel had
sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of
the east; they came up against them; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,4);</script>and they encamped against them,
and destroyed the increase of the earth, until you come to Gaza, and left
no sustenance in Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor donkey. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,5);</script>For they came up with their
livestock and their tents; they came in as locusts for multitude; both
they and their camels were without number: and they came into the land to
destroy it. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,6);</script>Israel was
brought very low because of Midian; and the children of Israel cried to
Yahweh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,7);</script>It happened, when the
children of Israel cried to Yahweh because of Midian, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,8);</script>that Yahweh sent a prophet to the
children of Israel: and he said to them, “Thus says Yahweh, the God of
Israel, ‘I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the
house of bondage; <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,9);</script>and I
delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all
who oppressed you, and drove them out from before you, and gave you their
land; <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,10);</script>and I said to you,
“I am Yahweh your God; you shall not fear the gods of the Amorites, in
whose land you dwell.” But you have not listened to my voice.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,11);</script>The angel of Yahweh
came, and sat under the oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained to Joash
the Abiezrite: and his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress,
to hide it from the Midianites. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,12);</script>The angel of Yahweh appeared to
him, and said to him, “Yahweh is with you, you mighty man of valor!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,13);</script>Gideon said to him,
“Oh, my lord, if Yahweh is with us, why then has all this happened to
us? Where are all his wondrous works which our fathers told us of, saying,
‘Didn’t Yahweh bring us up from Egypt?’ But now Yahweh has cast us
off, and delivered us into the hand of Midian.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,14);</script>Yahweh looked at him,
and said, “Go in this your might, and save Israel from the hand of
Midian. Haven’t I sent you?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,15);</script>He said to him, “O
<a href="#N3">Lord</a>, how shall I save Israel? Behold, my family is the
poorest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father’s house.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,16);</script>Yahweh said to him,
“Surely I will be with you, and you shall strike the Midianites as one
man.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,17);</script>He said to him, “If
now I have found favor in your sight, then show me a sign that it is you
who talk with me. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,18);</script>Please
don’t go away, until I come to you, and bring out my present, and lay it
before you.”
<p>He said, “I will wait until you come back.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,19);</script>Gideon went in, and
prepared a young goat, and unleavened cakes of an <a href="#N4">ephah</a>
of meal. He put the meat in a basket and he put the broth in a pot, and
brought it out to him under the oak, and presented it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,20);</script>The angel of God said
to him, “Take the meat and the unleavened cakes, and lay them on this
rock, and pour out the broth.”
<p>He did so. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,21);</script>Then the
angel of Yahweh stretched out the end of the staff that was in his hand,
and touched the meat and the unleavened cakes; and fire went up out of the
rock, and consumed the meat and the unleavened cakes; and the angel of
Yahweh departed out of his sight.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,22);</script>Gideon saw that he was
the angel of Yahweh; and Gideon said, “Alas, Lord Yahweh! Because I have
seen the angel of Yahweh face to face!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,23);</script>Yahweh said to him,
“Peace be to you! Don’t be afraid. You shall not die.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,24);</script>Then Gideon built an
altar there to Yahweh, and called it “<a href="#N5">Yahweh is
Peace</a>.” To this day it is still in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,25);</script>It happened the same
night, that Yahweh said to him, “Take your father’s bull, even the
second bull seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that your
father has, and cut down the Asherah that is by it; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,26);</script>and build an altar to Yahweh your
God on the top of this stronghold, in an orderly way, and take the second
bull, and offer a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah which you
shall cut down.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,27);</script>Then Gideon took ten
men of his servants, and did as Yahweh had spoken to him: and it happened,
because he feared his father’s household and the men of the city, so
that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,28);</script>When the men of the
city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken
down, and the Asherah was cut down that was by it, and the second bull was
offered on the altar that was built. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,29);</script>They said one to another, “Who
has done this thing?”
<p>When they inquired and asked, they said, “Gideon the son of Joash has
done this thing.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,30);</script>Then the men of the
city said to Joash, “Bring out your son, that he may die, because he has
broken down the altar of Baal, and because he has cut down the Asherah
that was by it.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,31);</script>Joash
said to all who stood against him, “Will you contend for Baal? Or will
you save him? He who will contend for him, let him be put to death by
morning. If he is a god, let him contend for himself, because someone has
broken down his altar.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,32);</script>Therefore on that day he named
him <a href="#N6">Jerub-Baal,</a> saying, “Let Baal contend against him,
because he has broken down his altar.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,33);</script>Then all the
Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east assembled
themselves together; and they passed over, and encamped in the valley of
Jezreel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,34);</script>But the Spirit
of Yahweh came on Gideon; and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered
together after him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,35);</script>He
sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; and they also were gathered
together after him: and he sent messengers to Asher, and to Zebulun, and
to Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,36);</script>Gideon said to God,
“If you will save Israel by my hand, as you have spoken, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,37);</script>behold, I will put a fleece of
wool on the threshing floor; if there is dew on the fleece only, and it is
dry on all the ground, then shall I know that you will save Israel by my
hand, as you have spoken.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,38);</script>It was so; for he rose
up early on the next day, and pressed the fleece together, and wrung the
dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,39);</script>Gideon said to God,
“Don’t let your anger be kindled against me, and I will speak but this
once. Please let me make a trial just this once with the fleece. Let it
now be dry only on the fleece, and on all the ground let there be dew.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,40);</script>God did so that night:
for it was dry on the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,1);</script>Then Jerubbaal, who is
Gideon, and all the people who were with him, rose up early, and encamped
beside the spring of Harod: and the camp of Midian was on the north side
of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,2);</script>Yahweh said to Gideon, “The
people who are with you are too many for me to give the Midianites into
their hand, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, ‘My own
hand has saved me.’ <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,3);</script>Now
therefore proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, ‘Whoever is
fearful and trembling, let him return and depart from Mount Gilead.’”
Twenty-two thousand of the people returned, and ten thousand remained.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,4);</script>Yahweh said to Gideon,
“The people are still too many. Bring them down to the water, and I will
test them for you there. It shall be, that of whom I tell you, ‘This
shall go with you,’ the same shall go with you; and of whoever I tell
you, ‘This shall not go with you,’ the same shall not go.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,5);</script>So he brought down the people to
the water; and Yahweh said to Gideon, “Everyone who laps of the water
with his tongue, like a dog laps, you shall set him by himself; likewise
everyone who bows down on his knees to drink.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,6);</script>The number of those who lapped,
putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men; but all the rest
of the people bowed down on their knees to drink water. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,7);</script>Yahweh said to Gideon, “By the
three hundred men who lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites
into your hand. Let all the other people go, each to his own place.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,8);</script>So the people took food
in their hand, and their trumpets; and he sent all the men of Israel every
man to his tent, but retained the three hundred men: and the camp of
Midian was beneath him in the valley. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,9);</script>It happened the same night, that
Yahweh said to him, “Arise, go down into the camp; for I have delivered
it into your hand. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,10);</script>But if
you are afraid to go down, go with Purah your servant down to the camp:
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,11);</script>and you shall hear what
they say; and afterward your hands will be strengthened to go down into
the camp.” Then went he down with Purah his servant to the outermost
part of the armed men who were in the camp.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,12);</script>The Midianites and the
Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like
locusts for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand
which is on the seashore for multitude.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,13);</script>When Gideon had come,
behold, there was a man telling a dream to his fellow; and he said,
“Behold, I dreamed a dream; and behold, a cake of barley bread tumbled
into the camp of Midian, and came to the tent, and struck it so that it
fell, and turned it upside down, so that the tent lay flat.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,14);</script>His fellow answered,
“This is nothing other than the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man
of Israel. God has delivered Midian into his hand, with all the army.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,15);</script>It was so, when Gideon
heard the telling of the dream, and its interpretation, that he worshiped;
and he returned into the camp of Israel, and said, “Arise; for Yahweh
has delivered the army of Midian into your hand!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,16);</script>He divided the three
hundred men into three companies, and he put into the hands of all of them
trumpets, and empty pitchers, with torches within the pitchers.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,17);</script>He said to them,
“Watch me, and do likewise. Behold, when I come to the outermost part of
the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so you shall do. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,18);</script>When I blow the trumpet, I and
all who are with me, then blow the trumpets also on every side of all the
camp, and shout, ‘For Yahweh and for Gideon!’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,19);</script>So Gideon, and the
hundred men who were with him, came to the outermost part of the camp in
the beginning of the middle watch, when they had but newly set the watch:
and they blew the trumpets, and broke in pieces the pitchers that were in
their hands. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,20);</script>The three
companies blew the trumpets, and broke the pitchers, and held the torches
in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands with which to
blow; and they shouted, “The sword of Yahweh and of Gideon!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,21);</script>They each stood in his place
around the camp; and all the army ran; and they shouted, and put them to
flight. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,22);</script>They blew the
three hundred trumpets, and Yahweh set every man’s sword against his
fellow, and against all the army; and the army fled as far as Beth Shittah
toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel Meholah, by Tabbath. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,23);</script>The men of Israel were gathered
together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and
pursued after Midian. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,24);</script>Gideon sent messengers throughout
all the hill country of Ephraim, saying, “Come down against Midian, and
take before them the waters, as far as Beth Barah, even the Jordan!” So
all the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and took the waters as far
as Beth Barah, even the Jordan. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,25);</script>They took the two princes of
Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and they killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb
they killed at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian: and they brought
the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon beyond the Jordan.
<p> <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,1);</script>The men of Ephraim
said to him, “Why have you treated us this way, that you didn’t call
us, when you went to fight with Midian?” They rebuked him sharply.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,2);</script>He said to them, “What
have I now done in comparison with you? Isn’t the gleaning of the grapes
of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,3);</script>God has delivered into your hand
the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb! What was I able to do in comparison
with you?” Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,4);</script>Gideon came to the
Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men who were with him,
faint, yet pursuing. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,5);</script>He
said to the men of Succoth, “Please give loaves of bread to the people
who follow me; for they are faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and
Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,6);</script>The princes of Succoth
said, “Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we
should give bread to your army?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,7);</script>Gideon said,
“Therefore when Yahweh has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand,
then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with
briers.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,8);</script>He went up there to
Penuel, and spoke to them in the same way; and the men of Penuel answered
him as the men of Succoth had answered. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,9);</script>He spoke also to the men of
Penuel, saying, “When I come again in peace, I will break down this
tower.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,10);</script>Now Zebah and Zalmunna
were in Karkor, and their armies with them, about fifteen thousand men,
all who were left of all the army of the children of the east; for there
fell one hundred twenty thousand men who drew sword. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,11);</script>Gideon went up by the way of
those who lived in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and struck the
army; for the army was secure. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,12);</script>Zebah and Zalmunna fled; and he
pursued after them; and he took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and
Zalmunna, and confused all the army. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,13);</script>Gideon the son of Joash returned
from the battle from the ascent of Heres. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,14);</script>He caught a young man of the men
of Succoth, and inquired of him: and he described for him the princes of
Succoth, and its elders, seventy-seven men. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,15);</script>He came to the men of Succoth,
and said, “See Zebah and Zalmunna, concerning whom you taunted me,
saying, ‘Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we
should give bread to your men who are weary?’” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,16);</script>He took the elders of the city,
and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men
of Succoth. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,17);</script>He broke down
the tower of Penuel, and killed the men of the city.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,18);</script>Then he said to Zebah
and Zalmunna, “What kind of men were they whom you killed at Tabor?”
<p>They answered, “They were like you. Each one resembled the children
of a king.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,19);</script>He said, “They were
my brothers, the sons of my mother. As Yahweh lives, if you had saved them
alive, I would not kill you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,20);</script>He said to Jether his
firstborn, “Get up, and kill them!” But the youth didn’t draw his
sword; for he was afraid, because he was yet a youth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,21);</script>Then Zebah and
Zalmunna said, “Rise and fall on us; for as the man is, so is his
strength.” Gideon arose, and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the
crescents that were on their camels’ necks.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,22);</script>Then the men of Israel
said to Gideon, “Rule over us, both you, and your son, and your son’s
son also; for you have saved us out of the hand of Midian.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,23);</script>Gideon said to them,
“I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you. Yahweh
shall rule over you.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,24);</script>Gideon said to them, “I would
make a request of you, that you would give me every man the earrings of
his spoil.” (For they had golden earrings, because they were
Ishmaelites.)
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,25);</script>They answered, “We
will willingly give them.” They spread a garment, and every man threw
the earrings of his spoil into it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,26);</script>The weight of the golden earrings
that he requested was one thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold,
besides the crescents, and the pendants, and the purple clothing that was
on the kings of Midian, and besides the chains that were about their
camels’ necks. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,27);</script>Gideon
made an ephod of it, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all
Israel played the prostitute after it there; and it became a snare to
Gideon, and to his house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,28);</script>So Midian was subdued before the
children of Israel, and they lifted up their heads no more. The land had
rest forty years in the days of Gideon. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,29);</script>Jerubbaal the son of Joash went
and lived in his own house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,30);</script>Gideon had seventy sons conceived
from his body; for he had many wives. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,31);</script>His concubine who was in Shechem,
she also bore him a son, and he named him Abimelech. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,32);</script>Gideon the son of Joash died in a
good old age, and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father, in Ophrah of
the Abiezrites. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,33);</script>It
happened, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned
again, and played the prostitute after the Baals, and made Baal Berith
their god. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,34);</script>The children
of Israel didn’t remember Yahweh their God, who had delivered them out
of the hand of all their enemies on every side; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,35);</script>neither did they show kindness to
the house of Jerubbaal, Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had
shown to Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,1);</script>Abimelech the son of
Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother’s brothers, and spoke with them,
and with all the family of the house of his mother’s father, saying,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,2);</script>“Please speak in the
ears of all the men of Shechem, ‘Is it better for you that all the sons
of Jerubbaal, who are seventy persons, rule over you, or that one rule
over you?’ Remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,3);</script>His mother’s brothers
spoke of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and
their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, “He is our
brother.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,4);</script>They gave him
seventy pieces of silver out of the house of Baal Berith, with which
Abimelech hired vain and light fellows, who followed him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,5);</script>He went to his father’s house at
Ophrah, and killed his brothers the sons of Jerubbaal, being seventy
persons, on one stone: but Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left;
for he hid himself. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,6);</script>All
the men of Shechem assembled themselves together, and all the house of
Millo, and went and made Abimelech king, by the oak of the pillar that was
in Shechem. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,7);</script>When they told
it to Jotham, he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim, and lifted up
his voice, and cried, and said to them, “Listen to me, you men of
Shechem, that God may listen to you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,8);</script>The trees went forth on a time to
anoint a king over them; and they said to the olive tree, ‘Reign over
us.’
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,9);</script>“But the olive tree
said to them, ‘Should I leave my fatness, with which by me they honor
God and man, and go to wave back and forth over the trees?’
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,10);</script>“The trees said to
the fig tree, ‘Come and reign over us.’
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,11);</script>“But the fig tree
said to them, ‘Should I leave my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to
wave back and forth over the trees?’
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,12);</script>“The trees said to
the vine, ‘Come and reign over us.’
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,13);</script>“The vine said to
them, ‘Should I leave my new wine, which cheers God and man, and go to
wave back and forth over the trees?’
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,14);</script>“Then all the trees
said to the bramble, ‘Come and reign over us.’
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,15);</script>“The bramble said to
the trees, ‘If in truth you anoint me king over you, then come and take
refuge in my shade; and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and
devour the cedars of Lebanon.’
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,16);</script>“Now therefore, if
you have dealt truly and righteously, in that you have made Abimelech
king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have
done to him according to the deserving of his hands <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,17);</script>(for my father fought for you,
and risked his life, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,18);</script>and you have risen up against my
father’s house this day, and have slain his sons, seventy persons, on
one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his female servant, king
over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother); <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,19);</script>if you then have dealt truly and
righteously with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice in
Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,20);</script>but if not, let fire come out
from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and
let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo,
and devour Abimelech.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,21);</script>Jotham ran away, and
fled, and went to Beer, and lived there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,22);</script>Abimelech was prince
over Israel three years. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,23);</script>God sent an evil spirit between
Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt
treacherously with Abimelech: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,24);</script>that the violence done to the
seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come, and that their blood might be laid
on Abimelech their brother, who killed them, and on the men of Shechem,
who strengthened his hands to kill his brothers. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,25);</script>The men of Shechem set an ambush
for him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all who came along
that way by them: and it was told Abimelech. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,26);</script>Gaal the son of Ebed came with
his brothers, and went over to Shechem; and the men of Shechem put their
trust in him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,27);</script>They went
out into the field, and harvested their vineyards, and trod the grapes,
and held festival, and went into the house of their god, and ate and
drank, and cursed Abimelech. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,28);</script>Gaal the son of Ebed said, “Who
is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? Isn’t he the
son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? Serve the men of Hamor the father
of Shechem: but why should we serve him? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,29);</script>Would that this people were under
my hand! Then I would remove Abimelech.” He said to Abimelech,
“Increase your army, and come out!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,30);</script>When Zebul the ruler
of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was
kindled. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,31);</script>He sent
messengers to Abimelech craftily, saying, “Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed
and his brothers have come to Shechem; and behold, they incite the city
against you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,32);</script>Now
therefore, go up by night, you and the people who are with you, and lie in
wait in the field: <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,33);</script>and it
shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, you shall rise
early, and rush on the city; and behold, when he and the people who are
with him come out against you, then may you do to them as you shall find
occasion.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,34);</script>Abimelech rose up, and
all the people who were with him, by night, and they laid wait against
Shechem in four companies. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,35);</script>Gaal the son of Ebed went out,
and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up,
and the people who were with him, from the ambush.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,36);</script>When Gaal saw the
people, he said to Zebul, “Behold, people are coming down from the tops
of the mountains.”
<p>Zebul said to him, “You see the shadow of the mountains as if they
were men.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,37);</script>Gaal spoke again and
said, “Behold, people are coming down by the middle of the land, and one
company comes by the way of the oak of Meonenim.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,38);</script>Then Zebul said to
him, “Now where is your mouth, that you said, ‘Who is Abimelech, that
we should serve him?’ Isn’t this the people that you have despised?
Please go out now and fight with them.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,39);</script>Gaal went out before
the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,40);</script>Abimelech chased him, and he fled
before him, and many fell wounded, even to the entrance of the gate.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,41);</script>Abimelech lived at
Arumah: and Zebul drove out Gaal and his brothers, that they should not
dwell in Shechem. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,42);</script>It
happened on the next day, that the people went out into the field; and
they told Abimelech. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,43);</script>He
took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in
the field; and he looked, and behold, the people came forth out of the
city; He rose up against them, and struck them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,44);</script>Abimelech, and the companies that
were with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entrance of the gate of
the city: and the two companies rushed on all who were in the field, and
struck them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,45);</script>Abimelech
fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and killed the
people who were therein: and he beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,46);</script>When all the men of
the tower of Shechem heard of it, they entered into the stronghold of the
house of Elberith. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,47);</script>It was
told Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered
together. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,48);</script>Abimelech went
up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people who were with him; and Abimelech
took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it
up, and laid it on his shoulder: and he said to the people who were with
him, “What you have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done!”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,49);</script>All the people likewise
each cut down his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them at the base
of the stronghold, and set the stronghold on fire on them; so that all the
people of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,50);</script>Then went Abimelech to
Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,51);</script>But there was a strong tower
within the city, and there fled all the men and women, and all they of the
city, and shut themselves in, and went up to the roof of the tower.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,52);</script>Abimelech came to the
tower, and fought against it, and drew near to the door of the tower to
burn it with fire. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,53);</script>A
certain woman cast an upper millstone on Abimelech’s head, and broke his
skull.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,54);</script>Then he called hastily
to the young man his armor bearer, and said to him, “Draw your sword,
and kill me, that men not say of me, ‘A woman killed him.’ His young
man thrust him through, and he died.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,55);</script>When the men of Israel
saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man to his place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,56);</script>Thus God requited the wickedness
of Abimelech, which he did to his father, in killing his seventy brothers;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,57);</script>and all the wickedness of
the men of Shechem did God requite on their heads: and on them came the
curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,1);</script>After Abimelech there
arose to save Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of
Issachar; and he lived in Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,2);</script>He judged Israel twenty-three
years, and died, and was buried in Shamir. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,3);</script>After him arose Jair, the
Gileadite; and he judged Israel twenty-two years. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,4);</script>He had thirty sons who rode on
thirty donkey colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havvoth
Jair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,5);</script>Jair died, and was buried in
Kamon. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,6);</script>The children of
Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and served
the Baals, and the Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of
Sidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and
the gods of the Philistines; and they forsook Yahweh, and didn’t serve
him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,7);</script>The anger of Yahweh
was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of the
Philistines, and into the hand of the children of Ammon. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,8);</script>They troubled and oppressed the
children of Israel that year. For eighteen years, they oppressed all the
children of Israel that were beyond the Jordan in the land of the
Amorites, which is in Gilead. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,9);</script>The children of Ammon passed over
the Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against
the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was very distressed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,10);</script>The children of Israel cried to
Yahweh, saying, “We have sinned against you, even because we have
forsaken our God, and have served the Baals.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,11);</script>Yahweh said to the
children of Israel, “Didn’t I save you from the Egyptians, and from
the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?
<script type="text/javascript">cb(10,12);</script>The Sidonians also, and
the Amalekites, and the Maonites, oppressed you; and you cried to me, and
I saved you out of their hand. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,13);</script>Yet you have forsaken me, and
served other gods: therefore I will save you no more. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,14);</script>Go and cry to the gods which you
have chosen. Let them save you in the time of your distress!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,15);</script>The children of
Israel said to Yahweh, “We have sinned: do you to us whatever seems good
to you; only deliver us, please, this day.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,16);</script>They put away the
foreign gods from among them, and served Yahweh; and his soul was grieved
for the misery of Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,17);</script>Then the children of
Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead. The children of
Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,18);</script>The people, the princes of
Gilead, said one to another, “What man is he who will begin to fight
against the children of Ammon? He shall be head over all the inhabitants
of Gilead.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,1);</script>Now Jephthah the
Gileadite was a mighty man of valor, and he was the son of a prostitute:
and Gilead became the father of Jephthah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,2);</script>Gilead’s wife bore him sons;
and when his wife’s sons grew up, they drove out Jephthah, and said to
him, “You shall not inherit in our father’s house; for you are the son
of another woman.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,3);</script>Then
Jephthah fled from his brothers, and lived in the land of Tob: and there
were gathered vain fellows to Jephthah, and they went out with him.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,4);</script>It happened after a
while, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,5);</script>It was so, that when the children
of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to get
Jephthah out of the land of Tob; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,6);</script>and they said to Jephthah,
“Come and be our chief, that we may fight with the children of Ammon.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,7);</script>Jephthah said to the
elders of Gilead, “Didn’t you hate me, and drive me out of my
father’s house? Why have you come to me now when you are in distress?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,8);</script>The elders of Gilead
said to Jephthah, “Therefore we have turned again to you now, that you
may go with us, and fight with the children of Ammon; and you shall be our
head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,9);</script>Jephthah said to the
elders of Gilead, “If you bring me home again to fight with the children
of Ammon, and Yahweh deliver them before me, shall I be your head?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,10);</script>The elders of Gilead
said to Jephthah, “Yahweh shall be witness between us; surely according
to your word so will we do.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,11);</script>Then Jephthah went
with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and chief over
them: and Jephthah spoke all his words before Yahweh in Mizpah.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,12);</script>Jephthah sent
messengers to the king of the children of Ammon, saying, “What have you
to do with me, that you have come to me to fight against my land?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,13);</script>The king of the
children of Ammon answered to the messengers of Jephthah, “Because
Israel took away my land, when he came up out of Egypt, from the Arnon
even to the Jabbok, and to the Jordan: now therefore restore that
territory again peaceably.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,14);</script>Jephthah sent
messengers again to the king of the children of Ammon; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,15);</script>and he said to him, “Thus says
Jephthah: Israel didn’t take away the land of Moab, nor the land of the
children of Ammon, <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,16);</script>but
when they came up from Egypt, and Israel went through the wilderness to
the <a href="#N7">Red Sea</a>, and came to Kadesh; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,17);</script>then Israel sent messengers to
the king of Edom, saying, ‘Please let me pass through your land;’ but
the king of Edom didn’t listen. In the same way, he sent to the king of
Moab; but he would not: and Israel stayed in Kadesh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,18);</script>Then they went through the
wilderness, and went around the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and
came by the east side of the land of Moab, and they encamped on the other
side of the Arnon; but they didn’t come within the border of Moab, for
the Arnon was the border of Moab. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,19);</script>Israel sent messengers to Sihon
king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said to him,
‘Please let us pass through your land to my place.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,20);</script>But Sihon didn’t trust Israel
to pass through his border; but Sihon gathered all his people together,
and encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,21);</script>Yahweh, the God of Israel,
delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they
struck them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the
inhabitants of that country. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,22);</script>They possessed all the border of
the Amorites, from the Arnon even to the Jabbok, and from the wilderness
even to the Jordan. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,23);</script>So
now Yahweh, the God of Israel, has dispossessed the Amorites from before
his people Israel, and should you possess them? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,24);</script>Won’t you possess that which
Chemosh your god gives you to possess? So whoever Yahweh our God has
dispossessed from before us, them will we possess. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,25);</script>Now are you anything better than
Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever strive against Israel,
or did he ever fight against them? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,26);</script>While Israel lived in Heshbon
and its towns, and in Aroer and its towns, and in all the cities that are
along by the side of the Arnon, three hundred years; why didn’t you
recover them within that time? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,27);</script>I therefore have not sinned
against you, but you do me wrong to war against me. Yahweh, the Judge, be
judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,28);</script>However the king of
the children of Ammon didn’t listen to the words of Jephthah which he
sent him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,29);</script>Then the
Spirit of Yahweh came on Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead and Manasseh,
and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over
to the children of Ammon.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,30);</script>Jephthah vowed a vow
to Yahweh, and said, “If you will indeed deliver the children of Ammon
into my hand, <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,31);</script>then it
shall be, that whatever comes forth from the doors of my house to meet me,
when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, it shall be Yahweh’s,
and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,32);</script>So Jephthah passed
over to the children of Ammon to fight against them; and Yahweh delivered
them into his hand. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,33);</script>He
struck them from Aroer until you come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and
to Abelcheramim, with a very great slaughter. So the children of Ammon
were subdued before the children of Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,34);</script>Jephthah came to
Mizpah to his house; and behold, his daughter came out to meet him with
tambourines and with dances: and she was his only child; besides her he
had neither son nor daughter. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,35);</script>It happened, when he saw her,
that he tore his clothes, and said, “Alas, my daughter! You have brought
me very low, and you are one of those who trouble me; for I have opened my
mouth to Yahweh, and I can’t go back.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,36);</script>She said to him,
“My father, you have opened your mouth to Yahweh; do to me according to
that which has proceeded out of your mouth, because Yahweh has taken
vengeance for you on your enemies, even on the children of Ammon.”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,37);</script>She said to her father,
“Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may
depart and go down on the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my
companions.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,38);</script>He said, “Go.” He
sent her away for two months: and she departed, she and her companions,
and mourned her virginity on the mountains. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,39);</script>It happened at the end of two
months, that she returned to her father, who did with her according to his
vow which he had vowed: and she was a virgin. It was a custom in Israel,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,40);</script>that the daughters of
Israel went yearly to celebrate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite
four days in a year.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,1);</script>The men of Ephraim
were gathered together, and passed northward; and they said to Jephthah,
“Why did you pass over to fight against the children of Ammon, and
didn’t call us to go with you? We will burn your house around you with
fire!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,2);</script>Jephthah said to them,
“I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and
when I called you, you didn’t save me out of their hand. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,3);</script>When I saw that you didn’t save
me, I put my life in my hand, and passed over against the children of
Ammon, and Yahweh delivered them into my hand. Why then have you come up
to me this day, to fight against me?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,4);</script>Then Jephthah gathered
together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim; and the men of
Gilead struck Ephraim, because they said, “You are fugitives of Ephraim,
you Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim, and in the midst of Manasseh.”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(12,5);</script>The Gileadites took the
fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites. It was so, that when the
fugitives of Ephraim said, “Let me go over,” the men of Gilead said to
him, “Are you an Ephraimite?” If he said, “No”; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,6);</script>then they said to him, “Now say
‘Shibboleth;’” and he said “Sibboleth”; for he couldn’t manage
to pronounce it right: then they siezed him, and killed him at the fords
of the Jordan. At that time, forty-two thousand of Ephraim fell. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,7);</script>Jephthah judged Israel six years.
Then Jephthah the Gileadite died, and was buried in the cities of Gilead.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(12,8);</script>After him Ibzan of
Bethlehem judged Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,9);</script>He had thirty sons; and thirty
daughters he sent abroad, and thirty daughters he brought in from abroad
for his sons. He judged Israel seven years. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,10);</script>Ibzan died, and was buried at
Bethlehem. <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,11);</script>After him
Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,12);</script>Elon the Zebulunite died, and
was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,13);</script>After him Abdon the son of
Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,14);</script>He had forty sons and thirty
sons’ sons, who rode on seventy donkey colts: and he judged Israel eight
years. <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,15);</script>Abdon the son of
Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of
Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,1);</script>The children of Israel
again did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh; and Yahweh delivered
them into the hand of the Philistines forty years. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,2);</script>There was a certain man of Zorah,
of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was
barren, and didn’t bear. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,3);</script>The angel of Yahweh appeared to
the woman, and said to her, “See now, you are barren, and don’t bear;
but you shall conceive, and bear a son. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,4);</script>Now therefore please beware and
drink no wine nor strong drink, and don’t eat any unclean thing: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,5);</script>for, behold, you shall conceive,
and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head; for the child shall
be a Nazirite to God from the womb: and he shall begin to save Israel out
of the hand of the Philistines.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,6);</script>Then the woman came
and told her husband, saying, “A man of God came to me, and his face was
like the face of the angel of God, very awesome; and I didn’t ask him
where he was from, neither did he tell me his name: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,7);</script>but he said to me, ‘Behold, you
shall conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink,
and eat not any unclean thing; for the child shall be a Nazirite to God
from the womb to the day of his death.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,8);</script>Then Manoah entreated
Yahweh, and said, “Oh, Lord, please let the man of God whom you did send
come again to us, and teach us what we shall do to the child who shall be
born.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,9);</script>God listened to the
voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat
in the field: but Manoah, her husband, wasn’t with her. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,10);</script>The woman made haste, and ran,
and told her husband, and said to him, “Behold, the man has appeared to
me, who came to me that day.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,11);</script>Manoah arose, and
went after his wife, and came to the man, and said to him, “Are you the
man who spoke to the woman?”
<p>He said, “I am.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,12);</script>Manoah said, “Now
let your words happen. What shall the child’s way of life and mission
be?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,13);</script>The angel of Yahweh
said to Manoah, “Of all that I said to the woman let her beware. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,14);</script>She may not eat of anything that
comes of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any
unclean thing; all that I commanded her let her observe.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,15);</script>Manoah said to the
angel of Yahweh, “Please, let us detain you, that we may make a young
goat ready for you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,16);</script>The angel of Yahweh
said to Manoah, “Though you detain me, I won’t eat of your bread; and
if you will prepare a burnt offering, you must offer it to Yahweh.” For
Manoah didn’t know that he was the angel of Yahweh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,17);</script>Manoah said to the
angel of Yahweh, “What is your name, that when your words happen, we may
honor you?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,18);</script>The angel of Yahweh
said to him, “Why do you ask about my name, since it is wonderful?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,19);</script>So Manoah took the
young goat with the meal offering, and offered it on the rock to Yahweh.
Then the angel did a wonderful thing as Manoah and his wife looked on.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,20);</script>For it happened, when
the flame went up toward the sky from off the altar, that the angel of
Yahweh ascended in the flame of the altar: and Manoah and his wife looked
on; and they fell on their faces to the ground. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,21);</script>But the angel of Yahweh didn’t
appear to Manoah or to his wife any more. Then Manoah knew that he was the
angel of Yahweh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,22);</script>Manoah
said to his wife, “We shall surely die, because we have seen God.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,23);</script>But his wife said to
him, “If Yahweh were pleased to kill us, he wouldn’t have received a
burnt offering and a meal offering at our hand, neither would he have
shown us all these things, nor would at this time have told such things as
these.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,24);</script>The woman bore
a son, and named him Samson: and the child grew, and Yahweh blessed him.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,25);</script>The Spirit of Yahweh
began to move him in Mahaneh Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,1);</script>Samson went down to
Timnah, and saw a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(14,2);</script>He came up, and told his
father and his mother, and said, “I have seen a woman in Timnah of the
daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me as wife.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,3);</script>Then his father and
his mother said to him, “Is there never a woman among the daughters of
your brothers, or among all my people, that you go to take a wife of the
uncircumcised Philistines?”
<p>Samson said to his father, “Get her for me; for she pleases me
well.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,4);</script>But his father and his
mother didn’t know that it was of Yahweh; for he sought an occasion
against the Philistines. Now at that time the Philistines had rule over
Israel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,5);</script>Then went Samson
down, and his father and his mother, to Timnah, and came to the vineyards
of Timnah: and behold, a young lion roared against him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,6);</script>The Spirit of Yahweh came
mightily on him, and he tore him as he would have torn a young goat; and
he had nothing in his hand: but he didn’t tell his father or his mother
what he had done. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,7);</script>He went
down, and talked with the woman, and she pleased Samson well. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,8);</script>After a while he returned to take
her; and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion: and behold, there
was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,9);</script>He took it into his hands, and
went on, eating as he went; and he came to his father and mother, and gave
to them, and they ate: but he didn’t tell them that he had taken the
honey out of the body of the lion. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,10);</script>His father went down to the
woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(14,11);</script>It happened, when they
saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,12);</script>Samson said to them,
“Let me tell you a riddle now. If you can declare it to me within the
seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty
linen garments and thirty changes of clothing; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,13);</script>but if you can’t declare it to
me, then you shall give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of
clothing.”
<p>They said to him, “Put forth your riddle, that we may hear it.”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(14,14);</script>He said to them,
<dl>
<dt>“Out of the eater came forth food.
<dd>Out of the strong came forth sweetness.”
</dl>
<p>They couldn’t in three days declare the riddle. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,15);</script>It happened on the seventh day,
that they said to Samson’s wife, “Entice your husband, that he may
declare to us the riddle, lest we burn you and your father’s house with
fire. Have you called us to impoverish us? Is it not so?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,16);</script>Samson’s wife wept
before him, and said, “You just hate me, and don’t love me. You have
put forth a riddle to the children of my people, and haven’t told it
me.”
<p>He said to her, “Behold, I haven’t told it my father nor my mother,
and shall I tell you?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,17);</script>She wept before him
the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it happened on the seventh
day, that he told her, because she pressed him severely; and she told the
riddle to the children of her people. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,18);</script>The men of the city said to him
on the seventh day before the sun went down, “What is sweeter than
honey? What is stronger than a lion?”
<p>He said to them,
<dl>
<dt>“If you hadn’t plowed with my heifer,
<dd>you wouldn’t have found out my riddle.”
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,19);</script>The Spirit of Yahweh
came mightily on him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and struck thirty men
of them, and took their spoil, and gave the changes of clothing to those
who declared the riddle. His anger was kindled, and he went up to his
father’s house. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,20);</script>But
Samson’s wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as his friend.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,1);</script>But it happened after
a while, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a
young goat; and he said, “I will go in to my wife into the room.”
<p>But her father wouldn’t allow him to go in. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,2);</script>Her father said, “I most
certainly thought that you had utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to
your companion. Isn’t her younger sister more beautiful than she? Please
take her, instead.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,3);</script>Samson said to them,
“This time I will be blameless in regard of the Philistines, when I harm
them.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,4);</script>Samson went and
caught three hundred foxes, and took torches, and turned tail to tail, and
put a torch in the midst between every two tails. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,5);</script>When he had set the brands on
fire, he let them go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burnt
up both the shocks and the standing grain, and also the olive groves.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,6);</script>Then the Philistines
said, “Who has done this?”
<p>They said, “Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he has
taken his wife, and given her to his companion.” The Philistines came
up, and burnt her and her father with fire.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,7);</script>Samson said to them,
“If you behave like this, surely I will be avenged of you, and after
that I will cease.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,8);</script>He
struck them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and
lived in the cleft of the rock of Etam. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,9);</script>Then the Philistines went up, and
encamped in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,10);</script>The men of Judah
said, “Why have you come up against us?”
<p>They said, “We have come up to bind Samson, to do to him as he has
done to us.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,11);</script>Then three thousand
men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to
Samson, “Don’t you know that the Philistines are rulers over us? What
then is this that you have done to us?”
<p>He said to them, “As they did to me, so have I done to them.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,12);</script>They said to him,
“We have come down to bind you, that we may deliver you into the hand of
the Philistines.”
<p>Samson said to them, “Swear to me that you will not fall on me
yourselves.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,13);</script>They spoke to him,
saying, “No; but we will bind you fast, and deliver you into their hand;
but surely we will not kill you.” They bound him with two new ropes, and
brought him up from the rock.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,14);</script>When he came to Lehi,
the Philistines shouted as they met him: and the Spirit of Yahweh came
mightily on him, and the ropes that were on his arms became as flax that
was burnt with fire, and his bands dropped from off his hands. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,15);</script>He found a fresh jawbone of a
donkey, and put forth his hand, and took it, and struck a thousand men
therewith. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,16);</script>Samson said,
“With the jawbone of a donkey, heaps on heaps; with the jawbone of a
donkey I have struck a thousand men.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,17);</script>It happened, when he had made an
end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand; and that
place was called Ramath Lehi. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,18);</script>He was very thirsty, and called
on Yahweh, and said, “You have given this great deliverance by the hand
of your servant; and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of
the uncircumcised?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,19);</script>But God split the
hollow place that is in Lehi, and water came out of it. When he had drunk,
his spirit came again, and he revived: therefore its name was called En
Hakkore, which is in Lehi, to this day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,20);</script>He judged Israel in the days of
the Philistines twenty years.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,1);</script>Samson went to Gaza,
and saw there a prostitute, and went in to her. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,2);</script>The Gazites were told, “Samson
is here!” They surrounded him, and laid wait for him all night in the
gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, “Wait until
morning light, then we will kill him.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,3);</script>Samson lay until midnight, and
arose at midnight, and laid hold of the doors of the gate of the city, and
the two posts, and plucked them up, bar and all, and put them on his
shoulders, and carried them up to the top of the mountain that is before
Hebron.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,4);</script>It came to pass
afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was
Delilah. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,5);</script>The lords of the
Philistines came up to her, and said to her, “Entice him, and see in
which his great strength lies, and by what means we may prevail against
him, that we may bind him to afflict him; and we will each give you eleven
hundred pieces of silver.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,6);</script>Delilah said to
Samson, “Please tell me where your great strength lies, and what you
might be bound to afflict you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,7);</script>Samson said to her,
“If they bind me with seven green cords that were never dried, then
shall I become weak, and be as another man.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,8);</script>Then the lords of the
Philistines brought up to her seven green cords which had not been dried,
and she bound him with them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,9);</script>Now she had an ambush waiting in
the inner room. She said to him, “The Philistines are on you, Samson!”
He broke the cords, as a string of tow is broken when it touches the fire.
So his strength was not known.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,10);</script>Delilah said to
Samson, “Behold, you have mocked me, and told me lies: now please tell
me with which you might be bound.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,11);</script>He said to her, “If
they only bind me with new ropes with which no work has been done, then
shall I become weak, and be as another man.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,12);</script>So Delilah took new
ropes, and bound him therewith, and said to him, “The Philistines are on
you, Samson!” The ambush was waiting in the inner room. He broke them
off his arms like a thread.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,13);</script>Delilah said to
Samson, “Until now, you have mocked me and told me lies. Tell me with
what you might be bound.”
<p>He said to her, “If you weave the seven locks of my head with the
web.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,14);</script>She fastened it with
the pin, and said to him, “The Philistines are on you, Samson!” He
awakened out of his sleep, and plucked away the pin of the beam, and the
web.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,15);</script>She said to him,
“How can you say, ‘I love you,’ when your heart is not with me? You
have mocked me these three times, and have not told me where your great
strength lies.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,16);</script>It happened, when she
pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, that his soul was
troubled to death. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,17);</script>He
told her all his heart, and said to her, “No razor has ever come on my
head; for I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother’s womb. If I am
shaved, then my strength will go from me, and I will become weak, and be
like any other man.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,18);</script>When Delilah saw that
he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the
Philistines, saying, “Come up this once, for he has told me all his
heart.” Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her, and brought
the money in their hand. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,19);</script>She made him sleep on her knees;
and she called for a man, and shaved off the seven locks of his head; and
she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,20);</script>She said, “The Philistines are
upon you, Samson!”
<p>He awoke out of his sleep, and said, “I will go out as at other
times, and shake myself free.” But he didn’t know that Yahweh had
departed from him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,21);</script>The
Philistines laid hold on him, and put out his eyes; and they brought him
down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he ground at the
mill in the prison. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,22);</script>However the hair of his head
began to grow again after he was shaved.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,23);</script>The lords of the
Philistines gathered them together to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon
their god, and to rejoice; for they said, “Our god has delivered Samson
our enemy into our hand.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,24);</script>When the people saw him, they
praised their god; for they said, “Our god has delivered our enemy and
the destroyer of our country, who has slain many of us, into our hand.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,25);</script>It happened, when
their hearts were merry, that they said, “Call for Samson, that he may
entertain us.” They called for Samson out of the prison; and he
performed before them. They set him between the pillars; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,26);</script>and Samson said to the boy who
held him by the hand, “Allow me to feel the pillars whereupon the house
rests, that I may lean on them.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,27);</script>Now the house was
full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there;
and there were on the roof about three thousand men and women, who saw
while Samson performed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,28);</script>Samson called to Yahweh, and
said, “Lord Yahweh, remember me, please, and strengthen me, please, only
this once, God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my
two eyes.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,29);</script>Samson took
hold of the two middle pillars on which the house rested, and leaned on
them, the one with his right hand, and the other with his left. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,30);</script>Samson said, “Let me die with
the Philistines!” He bowed himself with all his might; and the house
fell on the lords, and on all the people who were therein. So the dead
that he killed at his death were more than those who he killed in his
life. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,31);</script>Then his brothers
and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him
up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burial site of Manoah
his father. He judged Israel twenty years.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,1);</script>There was a man of the
hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,2);</script>He said to his mother, “The
eleven hundred pieces of silver that were taken from you, about which you
uttered a curse, and also spoke it in my ears, behold, the silver is with
me; I took it.”
<p>His mother said, “Blessed be my son of Yahweh.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,3);</script>He restored the eleven
hundred pieces of silver to his mother; and his mother said, “I most
certainly dedicate the silver to Yahweh from my hand for my son, to make
an engraved image and a molten image. Now therefore I will restore it to
you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,4);</script>When he restored the
money to his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver, and
gave them to the founder, who made of it an engraved image and a molten
image: and it was in the house of Micah.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,5);</script>The man Micah had a
house of gods, and he made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of
his sons, who became his priest. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,6);</script>In those days there was no king
in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,7);</script>There was a young man out of
Bethlehem Judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite; and he lived
there. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,8);</script>The man departed
out of the city, out of Bethlehem Judah, to live where he could find a
place, and he came to the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah,
as he traveled. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,9);</script>Micah
said to him, “Where did you come from?”
<p>He said to him, “I am a Levite of Bethlehem Judah, and I am looking
for a place to live.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,10);</script>Micah said to him, “Dwell with
me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give you ten pieces of
silver per year, a suit of clothing, and your food.” So the Levite went
in. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,11);</script>The Levite was
content to dwell with the man; and the young man was to him as one of his
sons. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,12);</script>Micah consecrated
the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of
Micah. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,13);</script>Then Micah said,
“Now know I that Yahweh will do good to me, since I have a Levite to my
priest.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,1);</script>In those days there
was no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought
an inheritance to dwell in; for to that day, their inheritance had not
fallen to them among the tribes of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,2);</script>The children of Dan sent of their
family five men from their whole number, men of valor, from Zorah, and
from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said to
them, “Go, explore the land!”
<p>They came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and
lodged there. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,3);</script>When they
were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the
Levite; and they turned aside there, and said to him, “Who brought you
here? What do you do in this place? What do you have here?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,4);</script>He said to them,
“Thus and thus has Micah dealt with me, and he has hired me, and I am
become his priest.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,5);</script>They said to him,
“Please ask counsel of God, that we may know whether our way which we go
shall be prosperous.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,6);</script>The priest said to
them, “Go in peace. Your way in which you go is before Yahweh.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,7);</script>Then the five men
departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people who were therein, how they
lived in security, in the way of the Sidonians, quiet and secure; for
there was none in the land, possessing authority, that might put them to
shame in anything, and they were far from the Sidonians, and had no
dealings with any man. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,8);</script>They came to their brothers to
Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brothers said to them, “What do you say?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,9);</script>They said, “Arise,
and let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and behold, it
is very good. Do you stand still? Don’t be slothful to go and to enter
in to possess the land. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,10);</script>When you go, you shall come to a
secure people, and the land is large; for God has given it into your hand,
a place where there is no want of anything that is in the earth.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,11);</script>There set forth from
there of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six
hundred men girt with weapons of war. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,12);</script>They went up, and encamped in
Kiriath Jearim, in Judah: therefore they called that place Mahaneh Dan, to
this day; behold, it is behind Kiriath Jearim. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,13);</script>They passed there to the hill
country of Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,14);</script>Then the five men who
went to spy out the country of Laish answered, and said to their brothers,
“Do you know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and
an engraved image, and a molten image? Now therefore consider what you
have to do.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,15);</script>They
turned aside there, and came to the house of the young man the Levite,
even to the house of Micah, and asked him of his welfare. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,16);</script>The six hundred men girt with
their weapons of war, who were of the children of Dan, stood by the
entrance of the gate. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,17);</script>The five men who went to spy out
the land went up, and came in there, and took the engraved image, and the
ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood by the
entrance of the gate with the six hundred men girt with weapons of war.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,18);</script>When these went into
Micah’s house, and fetched the engraved image, the ephod, and the
teraphim, and the molten image, the priest said to them, “What are you
doing?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,19);</script>They said to him,
“Hold your peace, put your hand on your mouth, and go with us, and be to
us a father and a priest. Is it better for you to be priest to the house
of one man, or to be priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,20);</script>The priest’s heart
was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the engraved image,
and went in the midst of the people. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,21);</script>So they turned and departed, and
put the little ones and the livestock and the goods before them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,22);</script>When they were a good way from
the house of Micah, the men who were in the houses near to Micah’s house
were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,23);</script>They cried to the children of
Dan. They turned their faces, and said to Micah, “What ails you, that
you come with such a company?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,24);</script>He said, “You have
taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and have gone away, and
what more do I have? How then do you say to me, ‘What ails you?’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,25);</script>The children of Dan
said to him, “Don’t let your voice be heard among us, lest angry
fellows fall on you, and you lose your life, with the lives of your
household.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,26);</script>The children of Dan
went their way: and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he
turned and went back to his house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,27);</script>They took that which Micah had
made, and the priest whom he had, and came to Laish, to a people quiet and
secure, and struck them with the edge of the sword; and they burnt the
city with fire. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,28);</script>There
was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon, and they had no dealings
with any man; and it was in the valley that lies by Beth Rehob. They built
the city, and lived therein. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,29);</script>They called the name of the city
Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel: however
the name of the city was Laish at the first. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,30);</script>The children of Dan set up for
themselves the engraved image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son
of Moses, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until
the day of the captivity of the land. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,31);</script>So they set them up Micah’s
engraved image which he made, all the time that God’s house was in
Shiloh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,1);</script>It happened in those
days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite
living on the farther side of the hill country of Ephraim, who took to him
a concubine out of Bethlehem Judah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,2);</script>His concubine played the
prostitute against him, and went away from him to her father’s house to
Bethlehem Judah, and was there the space of four months. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,3);</script>Her husband arose, and went after
her, to speak kindly to her, to bring her again, having his servant with
him, and a couple of donkeys: and she brought him into her father’s
house; and when the father of the young lady saw him, he rejoiced to meet
him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,4);</script>His father-in-law,
the young lady’s father, retained him; and he stayed with him three
days: so they ate and drink, and lodged there.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,5);</script>It happened on the
fourth day, that they arose early in the morning, and he rose up to
depart: and the young lady’s father said to his son-in-law,
“Strengthen your heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward you shall
go your way.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,6);</script>So they
sat down, ate, and drank, both of them together: and the young lady’s
father said to the man, “Please be pleased to stay all night, and let
your heart be merry.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,7);</script>The man rose up to depart; but
his father-in-law urged him, and he lodged there again. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,8);</script>He arose early in the morning on
the fifth day to depart; and the young lady’s father said, “Please
strengthen your heart and stay until the day declines”; and they both
ate.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,9);</script>When the man rose up
to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father-in-law, the
young lady’s father, said to him, “Behold, now the day draws toward
evening, please stay all night: behold, the day grows to an end, lodge
here, that your heart may be merry; and tomorrow go on your way early,
that you may go home.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,10);</script>But the man wouldn’t stay that
night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus (the same
is Jerusalem): and there were with him a couple of donkeys saddled; his
concubine also was with him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,11);</script>When they were by
Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said to his master,
“Please come and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites, and
lodge in it.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,12);</script>His master said to
him, “We won’t turn aside into the city of a foreigner, that is not of
the children of Israel; but we will pass over to Gibeah.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,13);</script>He said to his servant, “Come
and let us draw near to one of these places; and we will lodge in Gibeah,
or in Ramah.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,14);</script>So they
passed on and went their way; and the sun went down on them near to
Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,15);</script>They turned aside there, to go
in to lodge in Gibeah: and he went in, and sat him down in the street of
the city; for there was no man who took them into his house to lodge.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,16);</script>Behold, there came an
old man from his work out of the field at evening: now the man was of the
hill country of Ephraim, and he lived in Gibeah; but the men of the place
were Benjamites. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,17);</script>He
lifted up his eyes, and saw the wayfaring man in the street of the city;
and the old man said, “Where are you going? Where did you come from?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,18);</script>He said to him, “We
are passing from Bethlehem Judah to the farther side of the hill country
of Ephraim. I am from there, and I went to Bethlehem Judah. I am going to
the house of Yahweh; and there is no man who takes me into his house.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(19,19);</script>Yet there is both straw
and provender for our donkeys; and there is bread and wine also for me,
and for your handmaid, and for the young man who is with your servants:
there is no want of anything.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,20);</script>The old man said,
“Peace be to you; howsoever let all your wants lie on me; only don’t
lodge in the street.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,21);</script>So he brought him into his
house, and gave the donkeys fodder; and they washed their feet, and ate
and drink. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,22);</script>As they were
making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain base
fellows, surrounded the house, beating at the door; and they spoke to the
master of the house, the old man, saying, “Bring out the man who came
into your house, that we may have sex with him!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,23);</script>The man, the master
of the house, went out to them, and said to them, “No, my brothers,
please don’t act so wickedly; since this man has come into my house,
don’t do this folly. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,24);</script>Behold, here is my virgin
daughter and his concubine. I will bring them out now. Humble them, and do
with them what seems good to you; but to this man don’t do any such
folly.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,25);</script>But the men
wouldn’t listen to him: so the man laid hold of his concubine, and
brought her out to them; and they had sex with her, and abused her all
night until the morning: and when the day began to dawn, they let her go.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(19,26);</script>Then came the woman in
the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man’s house
where her lord was, until it was light. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,27);</script>Her lord rose up in the morning,
and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way; and behold,
the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, with her
hands on the threshold.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,28);</script>He said to her,
“Get up, and let us be going!” but no one answered. Then he took her
up on the donkey; and the man rose up, and went to his place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,29);</script>When he had come into
his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided
her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the
borders of Israel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,30);</script>It
was so, that all who saw it said, “There was no such deed done nor seen
from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt
to this day! Consider it, take counsel, and speak.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,1);</script>Then all the children
of Israel went out, and the congregation was assembled as one man, from
Dan even to Beersheba, with the land of Gilead, to Yahweh at Mizpah.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(20,2);</script>The chiefs of all the
people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the
assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen who drew
sword. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,3);</script>(Now the children
of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.) The
children of Israel said, “Tell us, how did this wickedness happen?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,4);</script>The Levite, the
husband of the woman who was murdered, answered, “I came into Gibeah
that belongs to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,5);</script>The men of Gibeah rose against
me, and surrounded the house by night. They thought to have slain me, and
they forced my concubine, and she is dead. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,6);</script>I took my concubine, and cut her
in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of
Israel; for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,7);</script>Behold, you children of Israel,
all of you, give here your advice and counsel.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,8);</script>All the people arose
as one man, saying, “None of us will go to his tent, neither will any of
us turn to his house. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,9);</script>But
now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah: we will go up against it
by lot; <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,10);</script>and we will take
ten men of one hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and one
hundred of one thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to get food
for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin,
according to all the folly that they have worked in Israel.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,11);</script>So all the men of Israel were
gathered against the city, knit together as one man.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,12);</script>The tribes of Israel
sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, “What wickedness is
this that is happen among you? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,13);</script>Now therefore deliver up the
men, the base fellows, who are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death,
and put away evil from Israel.”
<p>But Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brothers the
children of Israel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,14);</script>The
children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities to
Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,15);</script>The children of Benjamin were
numbered on that day out of the cities twenty-six thousand men who drew
the sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who were numbered seven
hundred chosen men. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,16);</script>Among all this people there were
seven hundred chosen men left-handed; everyone could sling stones at a
hair-breadth, and not miss. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,17);</script>The men of Israel, besides
Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men who drew sword: all
these were men of war.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,18);</script>The children of
Israel arose, and went up to Bethel, and asked counsel of God; and they
said, “Who shall go up for us first to battle against the children of
Benjamin?”
<p>Yahweh said, “Judah first.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,19);</script>The children of
Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,20);</script>The men of Israel went out to
battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel set the battle in array
against them at Gibeah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,21);</script>The children of Benjamin came
forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites on
that day twenty-two thousand men. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,22);</script>The people, the men of Israel,
encouraged themselves, and set the battle again in array in the place
where they set themselves in array the first day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,23);</script>The children of Israel went up
and wept before Yahweh until evening; and they asked of Yahweh, saying,
“Shall I again draw near to battle against the children of Benjamin my
brother?”
<p>Yahweh said, “Go up against him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,24);</script>The children of
Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,25);</script>Benjamin went forth against them
out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the
children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,26);</script>Then all the children
of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came to Bethel, and wept, and
sat there before Yahweh, and fasted that day until evening; and they
offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,27);</script>The children of Israel asked of
Yahweh (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(20,28);</script>and Phinehas, the son of
Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days), saying,
“Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my
brother, or shall I cease?”
<p>Yahweh said, “Go up; for tomorrow I will deliver him into your
hand.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,29);</script>Israel set ambushes
all around Gibeah. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,30);</script>The
children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third
day, and set themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(20,31);</script>The children of Benjamin
went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they
began to strike and kill of the people, as at other times, in the
highways, of which one goes up to Bethel, and the other to Gibeah, in the
field, about thirty men of Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,32);</script>The children of
Benjamin said, “They are struck down before us, as at the first.” But
the children of Israel said, “Let us flee, and draw them away from the
city to the highways.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,33);</script>All the men of Israel
rose up out of their place, and set themselves in array at Baal Tamar: and
the ambushers of Israel broke forth out of their place, even out of Maareh
Geba. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,34);</script>There came over
against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle
was severe; but they didn’t know that evil was close on them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,35);</script>Yahweh struck Benjamin before
Israel; and the children of Israel destroyed of Benjamin that day
twenty-five thousand one hundred men: all these drew the sword. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,36);</script>So the children of Benjamin saw
that they were struck; for the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin,
because they trusted the ambushers whom they had set against Gibeah.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(20,37);</script>The ambushers hurried,
and rushed on Gibeah; and the ambushers drew themselves along, and struck
all the city with the edge of the sword. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,38);</script>Now the appointed sign between
the men of Israel and the ambushers was that they should make a great
cloud of smoke rise up out of the city. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,39);</script>The men of Israel turned in the
battle, and Benjamin began to strike and kill of the men of Israel about
thirty persons; for they said, “Surely they are struck down before us,
as in the first battle.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,40);</script>But when the cloud began to
arise up out of the city in a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked
behind them; and behold, the whole of the city went up in smoke to the
sky. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,41);</script>The men of Israel
turned, and the men of Benjamin were dismayed; for they saw that evil had
come on them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,42);</script>Therefore
they turned their backs before the men of Israel to the way of the
wilderness; but the battle followed hard after them; and those who came
out of the cities destroyed them in its midst. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,43);</script>They surrounded the Benjamites,
chased them, and trod them down at their resting place, as far as over
against Gibeah toward the sunrise. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,44);</script>There fell of Benjamin eighteen
thousand men; all these were men of valor. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,45);</script>They turned and fled toward the
wilderness to the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways
five thousand men, and followed hard after them to Gidom, and struck of
them two thousand men. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,46);</script>So that all who fell that day of
Benjamin were twenty-five thousand men who drew the sword; all these were
men of valor. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,47);</script>But six
hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon,
and stayed in the rock of Rimmon four months. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,48);</script>The men of Israel turned again
on the children of Benjamin, and struck them with the edge of the sword,
both the entire city, and the livestock, and all that they found: moreover
all the cities which they found they set on fire.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,1);</script>Now the men of Israel
had sworn in Mizpah, saying, “There shall not any of us give his
daughter to Benjamin as wife.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,2);</script>The people came to Bethel, and
sat there until evening before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept
severely. <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,3);</script>They said,
“Yahweh, the God of Israel, why has this happened in Israel, that there
should be today one tribe lacking in Israel?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,4);</script>It happened on the
next day that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered
burnt offerings and peace offerings. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,5);</script>The children of Israel said,
“Who is there among all the tribes of Israel who didn’t come up in the
assembly to Yahweh?” For they had made a great oath concerning him who
didn’t come up to Yahweh to Mizpah, saying, “He shall surely be put to
death.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,6);</script>The children of
Israel grieved for Benjamin their brother, and said, “There is one tribe
cut off from Israel this day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,7);</script>How shall we provide wives for
those who remain, since we have sworn by Yahweh that we will not give them
of our daughters to wives?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,8);</script>They said, “What one is there
of the tribes of Israel who didn’t come up to Yahweh to Mizpah?”
Behold, there came none to the camp from Jabesh Gilead to the assembly.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(21,9);</script>For when the people were
numbered, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead
there. <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,10);</script>The congregation
sent there twelve thousand men of the most valiant, and commanded them,
saying, “Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead with the edge of
the sword, with the women and the little ones. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,11);</script>This is the thing that you shall
do: you shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman who has lain
with a man.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,12);</script>They
found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young virgins,
who had not known man by lying with him; and they brought them to the camp
to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,13);</script>The whole congregation sent and
spoke to the children of Benjamin who were in the rock of Rimmon, and
proclaimed peace to them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,14);</script>Benjamin returned at that time;
and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of
Jabesh Gilead: and yet so they weren’t enough for them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,15);</script>The people grieved for Benjamin,
because that Yahweh had made a breach in the tribes of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,16);</script>Then the elders of the
congregation said, “How shall we provide wives for those who remain,
since the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,17);</script>They said, “There must be an
inheritance for those who are escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe not be
blotted out from Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,18);</script>However we may not give them
wives of our daughters, for the children of Israel had sworn, saying,
‘Cursed is he who gives a wife to Benjamin.’” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,19);</script>They said, “Behold, there is a
feast of Yahweh from year to year in Shiloh, which is on the north of
Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to
Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,20);</script>They commanded the children of
Benjamin, saying, “Go and lie in wait in the vineyards, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,21);</script>and see, and behold, if the
daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then come out of the
vineyards, and each man catch his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go
to the land of Benjamin. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,22);</script>It shall be, when their fathers
or their brothers come to complain to us, that we will say to them,
‘Grant them graciously to us, because we didn’t take for each man his
wife in battle, neither did you give them to them, otherwise you would now
be guilty.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,23);</script>The children of
Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of those
who danced, whom they carried off. They went and returned to their
inheritance, built the cities, and lived in them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,24);</script>The children of Israel departed
there at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they
went out from there every man to his inheritance. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,25);</script>In those days there was no king
in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.
