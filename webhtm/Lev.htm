Leviticus
</h1><p>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,1);</script><a href="#N1">Yahweh</a>
called to Moses, and spoke to him out of the Tent of Meeting, saying,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,2);</script>“Speak to the children
of Israel, and tell them, ‘When anyone of you offers an offering to
Yahweh, you shall offer your offering of the livestock, from the herd and
from the flock.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,3);</script>“‘If his offering
is a burnt offering from the herd, he shall offer a male without blemish.
He shall offer it at the door of the Tent of Meeting, that he may be
accepted before Yahweh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,4);</script>He
shall lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering, and it shall be
accepted for him to make atonement for him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,5);</script>He shall kill the bull before
Yahweh. Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall present the blood and sprinkle
the blood around on the altar that is at the door of the Tent of Meeting.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,6);</script>He shall flay the burnt
offering, and cut it into pieces. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,7);</script>The sons of Aaron the priest shall
put fire on the altar, and lay wood in order on the fire; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,8);</script>and Aaron’s sons, the priests,
shall lay the pieces, the head, and the fat in order on the wood that is
on the fire which is on the altar; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,9);</script>but its innards and its legs he
shall wash with water. The priest shall burn the whole on the altar, for a
burnt offering, an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,10);</script>“‘If his offering
is from the flock, from the sheep, or from the goats, for a burnt
offering, he shall offer a male without blemish. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,11);</script>He shall kill it on the north
side of the altar before Yahweh. Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall
sprinkle its blood around on the altar. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,12);</script>He shall cut it into its pieces,
with its head and its fat. The priest shall lay them in order on the wood
that is on the fire which is on the altar, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,13);</script>but the innards and the legs he
shall wash with water. The priest shall offer the whole, and burn it on
the altar. It is a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, of a pleasant
aroma to Yahweh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,14);</script>“‘If his offering
to Yahweh is a burnt offering of birds, then he shall offer his offering
of turtledoves, or of young pigeons. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,15);</script>The priest shall bring it to the
altar, and wring off its head, and burn it on the altar; and its blood
shall be drained out on the side of the altar; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,16);</script>and he shall take away its crop
with its filth, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, in the
place of the ashes. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,17);</script>He
shall tear it by its wings, but shall not divide it apart. The priest
shall burn it on the altar, on the wood that is on the fire. It is a burnt
offering, an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,1);</script>“‘When anyone
offers an offering of a meal offering to Yahweh, his offering shall be of
fine flour; and he shall pour oil on it, and put frankincense on it.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,2);</script>He shall bring it to
Aaron’s sons, the priests; and he shall take his handful of its fine
flour, and of its oil, with all its frankincense; and the priest shall
burn its memorial on the altar, an offering made by fire, of a pleasant
aroma to Yahweh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,3);</script>That
which is left of the meal offering shall be Aaron’s and his sons’. It
is a most holy thing of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,4);</script>“‘When you offer an
offering of a meal offering baked in the oven, it shall be unleavened
cakes of fine flour mixed with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with
oil. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,5);</script>If your offering is a
meal offering of the griddle, it shall be of unleavened fine flour, mixed
with oil. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,6);</script>You shall cut it
in pieces, and pour oil on it. It is a meal offering. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,7);</script>If your offering is a meal
offering of the pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,8);</script>You shall bring the meal offering
that is made of these things to Yahweh: and it shall be presented to the
priest, and he shall bring it to the altar. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,9);</script>The priest shall take from the
meal offering its memorial, and shall burn it on the altar, an offering
made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,10);</script>That which is left of the meal
offering shall be Aaron’s and his sons’. It is a thing most holy of
the offerings of Yahweh made by fire.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,11);</script>“‘No meal
offering, which you shall offer to Yahweh, shall be made with yeast; for
you shall burn no yeast, nor any honey, as an offering made by fire to
Yahweh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,12);</script>As an offering of
firstfruits you shall offer them to Yahweh: but they shall not ascend for
a pleasant aroma on the altar. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,13);</script>Every offering of your meal
offering you shall season with salt; neither shall you allow the salt of
the covenant of your <a href="#N2">God</a> to be lacking from your meal
offering. With all your offerings you shall offer salt.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,14);</script>“‘If you offer a
meal offering of first fruits to Yahweh, you shall offer for the meal
offering of your first fruits grain in the ear parched with fire, bruised
grain of the fresh ear. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,15);</script>You shall put oil on it, and lay
frankincense on it: it is a meal offering. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,16);</script>The priest shall burn as its
memorial, part of its bruised grain, and part of its oil, along with all
its frankincense: it is an offering made by fire to Yahweh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,1);</script>“‘If his offering
is a sacrifice of peace offerings; if he offers it from the herd, whether
male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,2);</script>He shall lay his hand on the head
of his offering, and kill it at the door of the Tent of Meeting: and
Aaron’s sons, the priests shall sprinkle the blood around on the altar.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,3);</script>He shall offer of the
sacrifice of peace offerings an offering made by fire to Yahweh; the fat
that covers the innards, and all the fat that is on the innards, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,4);</script>and the two kidneys, and the fat
that is on them, which is by the loins, and the cover on the liver, with
the kidneys, he shall take away. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,5);</script>Aaron’s sons shall burn it on
the altar on the burnt offering, which is on the wood that is on the fire:
it is an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,6);</script>“‘If his offering
for a sacrifice of peace offerings to Yahweh is from the flock; male or
female, he shall offer it without blemish. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,7);</script>If he offers a lamb for his
offering, then he shall offer it before Yahweh; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,8);</script>and he shall lay his hand on the
head of his offering, and kill it before the Tent of Meeting: and
Aaron’s sons shall sprinkle its blood around on the altar. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,9);</script>He shall offer from the sacrifice
of peace offerings an offering made by fire to Yahweh; its fat, the entire
tail fat, he shall take away close to the backbone; and the fat that
covers the inwards, and all the fat that is on the inwards, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,10);</script>and the two kidneys, and the fat
that is on them, which is by the loins, and the cover on the liver, with
the kidneys, he shall take away. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,11);</script>The priest shall burn it on the
altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire to Yahweh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,12);</script>“‘If his offering
is a goat, then he shall offer it before Yahweh: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,13);</script>and he shall lay his hand on its
head, and kill it before the Tent of Meeting; and the sons of Aaron shall
sprinkle its blood around on the altar. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,14);</script>He shall offer from it as his
offering, an offering made by fire to Yahweh; the fat that covers the
innards, and all the fat that is on the innards, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,15);</script>and the two kidneys, and the fat
that is on them, which is by the loins, and the cover on the liver, with
the kidneys, he shall take away. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,16);</script>The priest shall burn them on the
altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire, for a pleasant aroma;
all the fat is Yahweh’s.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,17);</script>“‘It shall be a
perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings, that
you shall eat neither fat nor blood.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,1);</script>Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,2);</script>“Speak to the
children of Israel, saying, ‘If anyone sins unintentionally, in any of
the things which Yahweh has commanded not to be done, and does any one of
them: <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,3);</script>if the anointed
priest sins so as to bring guilt on the people, then let him offer for his
sin, which he has sinned, a young bull without blemish to Yahweh for a sin
offering. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,4);</script>He shall bring
the bull to the door of the Tent of Meeting before Yahweh; and he shall
lay his hand on the head of the bull, and kill the bull before Yahweh.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,5);</script>The anointed priest shall
take some of the blood of the bull, and bring it to the Tent of Meeting.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,6);</script>The priest shall dip his
finger in the blood, and sprinkle some of the blood seven times before
Yahweh, before the veil of the sanctuary. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,7);</script>The priest shall put some of the
blood on the horns of the altar of sweet incense before Yahweh, which is
in the Tent of Meeting; and he shall pour out all of rest of the blood of
the bull at the base of the altar of burnt offering, which is at the door
of the Tent of Meeting. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,8);</script>He
shall take all the fat of the bull of the sin offering off of it; the fat
that covers the innards, and all the fat that is on the innards, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,9);</script>and the two kidneys, and the fat
that is on them, which is by the loins, and the cover on the liver, with
the kidneys, he shall take away, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,10);</script>as it is taken off of the bull of
the sacrifice of peace offerings. The priest shall burn them on the altar
of burnt offering. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,11);</script>The
bull’s skin, all its flesh, with its head, and with its legs, its
innards, and its dung, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,12);</script>even the whole bull shall he
carry forth outside the camp to a clean place, where the ashes are poured
out, and burn it on wood with fire. Where the ashes are poured out it
shall be burned.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,13);</script>“‘If the whole
congregation of Israel sins, and the thing is hidden from the eyes of the
assembly, and they have done any of the things which Yahweh has commanded
not to be done, and are guilty; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,14);</script>when the sin in which they have
sinned is known, then the assembly shall offer a young bull for a sin
offering, and bring it before the Tent of Meeting. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,15);</script>The elders of the congregation
shall lay their hands on the head of the bull before Yahweh; and the bull
shall be killed before Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,16);</script>The anointed priest shall bring
of the blood of the bull to the Tent of Meeting: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,17);</script>and the priest shall dip his
finger in the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before Yahweh, before the
veil. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,18);</script>He shall put some
of the blood on the horns of the altar which is before Yahweh, that is in
the Tent of Meeting; and the rest of the blood he shall pour out at the
base of the altar of burnt offering, which is at the door of the Tent of
Meeting. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,19);</script>All its fat he
shall take from it, and burn it on the altar. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,20);</script>Thus shall he do with the bull;
as he did with the bull of the sin offering, so shall he do with this; and
the priest shall make atonement for them, and they shall be forgiven.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,21);</script>He shall carry forth the
bull outside the camp, and burn it as he burned the first bull. It is the
sin offering for the assembly.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,22);</script>“‘When a ruler
sins, and unwittingly does any one of all the things which Yahweh his God
has commanded not to be done, and is guilty; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,23);</script>if his sin, in which he has
sinned, is made known to him, he shall bring as his offering a goat, a
male without blemish. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,24);</script>He
shall lay his hand on the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where
they kill the burnt offering before Yahweh. It is a sin offering. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,25);</script>The priest shall take some of the
blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it on the horns of the
altar of burnt offering. He shall pour out the rest of its blood at the
base of the altar of burnt offering. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,26);</script>All its fat he shall burn on the
altar, like the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest
shall make atonement for him concerning his sin, and he will be forgiven.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,27);</script>“‘If anyone of the
common people sins unwittingly, in doing any of the things which Yahweh
has commanded not to be done, and is guilty; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,28);</script>if his sin, which he has sinned,
is made known to him, then he shall bring for his offering a goat, a
female without blemish, for his sin which he has sinned. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,29);</script>He shall lay his hand on the head
of the sin offering, and kill the sin offering in the place of burnt
offering. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,30);</script>The priest
shall take some of its blood with his finger, and put it on the horns of
the altar of burnt offering; and the rest of its blood he shall pour out
at the base of the altar. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,31);</script>All its fat he shall take away,
like the fat is taken away from off of the sacrifice of peace offerings;
and the priest shall burn it on the altar for a pleasant aroma to Yahweh;
and the priest shall make atonement for him, and he will be forgiven.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,32);</script>“‘If he brings a
lamb as his offering for a sin offering, he shall bring a female without
blemish. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,33);</script>He shall lay his
hand on the head of the sin offering, and kill it for a sin offering in
the place where they kill the burnt offering. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,34);</script>The priest shall take some of the
blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it on the horns of the
altar of burnt offering; and all the rest of its blood he shall pour out
at the base of the altar. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,35);</script>All its fat he shall take away,
like the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of peace
offerings; and the priest shall burn them on the altar, on the offerings
of Yahweh made by fire; and the priest shall make atonement for him
concerning his sin that he has sinned, and he will be forgiven.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,1);</script>“‘If anyone sins,
in that he hears the voice of adjuration, he being a witness, whether he
has seen or known, if he doesn’t report it, then he shall bear his
iniquity.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,2);</script>“‘Or if anyone
touches any unclean thing, whether it is the carcass of an unclean animal,
or the carcass of unclean livestock, or the carcass of unclean creeping
things, and it is hidden from him, and he is unclean, then he shall be
guilty.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,3);</script>“‘Or if he touches
the uncleanness of man, whatever his uncleanness is with which he is
unclean, and it is hidden from him; when he knows of it, then he shall be
guilty.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,4);</script>“‘Or if anyone
swears rashly with his lips to do evil, or to do good, whatever it is that
a man might utter rashly with an oath, and it is hidden from him; when he
knows of it, then he shall be guilty of one of these. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,5);</script>It shall be, when he is guilty of
one of these, he shall confess that in which he has sinned: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,6);</script>and he shall bring his trespass
offering to Yahweh for his sin which he has sinned, a female from the
flock, a lamb or a goat, for a sin offering; and the priest shall make
atonement for him concerning his sin.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,7);</script>“‘If he can’t
afford a lamb, then he shall bring his trespass offering for that in which
he has sinned, two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, to Yahweh; one for a
sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,8);</script>He shall bring them to the priest,
who shall first offer the one which is for the sin offering, and wring off
its head from its neck, but shall not sever it completely. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,9);</script>He shall sprinkle some of the
blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar; and the rest of the
blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar. It is a sin offering.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(5,10);</script>He shall offer the second
for a burnt offering, according to the ordinance; and the priest shall
make atonement for him concerning his sin which he has sinned, and he
shall be forgiven.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,11);</script>“‘But if he
can’t afford two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, then he shall bring
his offering for that in which he has sinned, the tenth part of an <a
href="#N3">ephah</a> of fine flour for a sin offering. He shall put no oil
on it, neither shall he put any frankincense on it, for it is a sin
offering. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,12);</script>He shall bring
it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it as the
memorial portion, and burn it on the altar, on the offerings of Yahweh
made by fire. It is a sin offering. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,13);</script>The priest shall make atonement
for him concerning his sin that he has sinned in any of these things, and
he will be forgiven; and the rest shall be the priest’s, as the meal
offering.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,14);</script>Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,15);</script>“If anyone
commits a trespass, and sins unwittingly, in the holy things of Yahweh;
then he shall bring his trespass offering to Yahweh, a ram without blemish
from the flock, according to your estimation in silver by shekels, after
the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,16);</script>He shall make restitution for
that which he has done wrong in the holy thing, and shall add a fifth part
to it, and give it to the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for
him with the ram of the trespass offering, and he will be forgiven.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,17);</script>“If anyone sins, and
does any of the things which Yahweh has commanded not to be done; though
he didn’t know it, yet he is guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(5,18);</script>He shall bring a ram
without blemish from of the flock, according to your estimation, for a
trespass offering, to the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for
him concerning the thing in which he sinned and didn’t know it, and he
will be forgiven. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,19);</script>It is a
trespass offering. He is certainly guilty before Yahweh.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,1);</script>Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,2);</script>“If anyone sins,
and commits a trespass against Yahweh, and deals falsely with his neighbor
in a matter of deposit, or of bargain, or of robbery, or has oppressed his
neighbor, <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,3);</script>or has found
that which was lost, and dealt falsely therein, and swearing to a lie; in
any of all these things that a man does, sinning therein; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,4);</script>then it shall be, if he has
sinned, and is guilty, he shall restore that which he took by robbery, or
the thing which he has gotten by oppression, or the deposit which was
committed to him, or the lost thing which he found, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,5);</script>or any thing about which he has
sworn falsely; he shall restore it even in full, and shall add a fifth
part more to it. To him to whom it belongs he shall give it, in the day of
his being found guilty. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,6);</script>He
shall bring his trespass offering to Yahweh, a ram without blemish from
the flock, according to your estimation, for a trespass offering, to the
priest. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,7);</script>The priest shall
make atonement for him before Yahweh, and he will be forgiven concerning
whatever he does to become guilty.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,8);</script>Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,9);</script>“Command Aaron
and his sons, saying, ‘This is the law of the burnt offering: the burnt
offering shall be on the hearth on the altar all night until the morning;
and the fire of the altar shall be kept burning on it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,10);</script>The priest shall put on his linen
garment, and he shall put on his linen breeches upon his body; and he
shall remove the ashes from where the fire has consumed the burnt offering
on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,11);</script>He shall take off his garments,
and put on other garments, and carry the ashes outside the camp to a clean
place. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,12);</script>The fire on the
altar shall be kept burning on it, it shall not go out; and the priest
shall burn wood on it every morning: and he shall lay the burnt offering
in order upon it, and shall burn on it the fat of the peace offerings.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(6,13);</script>Fire shall be kept
burning on the altar continually; it shall not go out.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,14);</script>“‘This is the law
of the meal offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer it before Yahweh,
before the altar. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,15);</script>He
shall take from there his handful of the fine flour of the meal offering,
and of its oil, and all the frankincense which is on the meal offering,
and shall burn it on the altar for a pleasant aroma, as its memorial, to
Yahweh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,16);</script>That which is
left of it Aaron and his sons shall eat. It shall be eaten without yeast
in a holy place. They shall eat it in the court of the Tent of Meeting.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(6,17);</script>It shall not be baked
with yeast. I have given it as their portion of my offerings made by fire.
It is most holy, as the sin offering, and as the trespass offering.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(6,18);</script>Every male among the
children of Aaron shall eat of it, as their portion forever throughout
your generations, from the offerings of Yahweh made by fire. Whoever
touches them shall be holy.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,19);</script>Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,20);</script>“This is the
offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer to Yahweh in the
day when he is anointed: the tenth part of an <a href="#N4">ephah</a> of
fine flour for a meal offering perpetually, half of it in the morning, and
half of it in the evening. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,21);</script>It shall be made with oil in a
griddle. When it is soaked, you shall bring it in. You shall offer the
meal offering in baked pieces for a pleasant aroma to Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,22);</script>The anointed priest that will be
in his place from among his sons shall offer it. By a statute forever, it
shall be wholly burnt to Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,23);</script>Every meal offering of a priest
shall be wholly burned. It shall not be eaten.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,24);</script>Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,25);</script>“Speak to Aaron
and to his sons, saying, ‘This is the law of the sin offering: in the
place where the burnt offering is killed, the sin offering shall be killed
before Yahweh. It is most holy. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,26);</script>The priest who offers it for sin
shall eat it. It shall be eaten in a holy place, in the court of the Tent
of Meeting. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,27);</script>Whatever
shall touch its flesh shall be holy. When there is any of its blood
sprinkled on a garment, you shall wash that on which it was sprinkled in a
holy place. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,28);</script>But the
earthen vessel in which it is boiled shall be broken; and if it is boiled
in a bronze vessel, it shall be scoured, and rinsed in water. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,29);</script>Every male among the priests
shall eat of it: it is most holy. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,30);</script>No sin offering, of which any of
the blood is brought into the Tent of Meeting to make atonement in the
Holy Place, shall be eaten: it shall be burned with fire.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,1);</script>“‘This is the law
of the trespass offering. It is most holy. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,2);</script>In the place where they kill the
burnt offering, he shall kill the trespass offering; and its blood he
shall sprinkle around on the altar. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,3);</script>He shall offer all of its fat: the
fat tail, and the fat that covers the innards, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,4);</script>and the two kidneys, and the fat
that is on them, which is by the loins, and the cover on the liver, with
the kidneys, shall he take away; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,5);</script>and the priest shall burn them on
the altar for an offering made by fire to Yahweh: it is a trespass
offering. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,6);</script>Every male among
the priests may eat of it. It shall be eaten in a holy place. It is most
holy.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,7);</script>“‘As is the sin
offering, so is the trespass offering; there is one law for them. The
priest who makes atonement with them shall have it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,8);</script>The priest who offers any man’s
burnt offering, even the priest shall have for himself the skin of the
burnt offering which he has offered. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,9);</script>Every meal offering that is baked
in the oven, and all that is dressed in the pan, and on the griddle, shall
be the priest’s who offers it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,10);</script>Every meal offering, mixed with
oil or dry, belongs to all the sons of Aaron, one as well as another.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,11);</script>“‘This is the law
of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which one shall offer to Yahweh.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,12);</script>If he offers it for a
thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving
unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil,
and cakes mixed with oil. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,13);</script>With cakes of leavened bread he
shall offer his offering with the sacrifice of his peace offerings for
thanksgiving. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,14);</script>Of it he
shall offer one out of each offering for a heave offering to Yahweh. It
shall be the priest’s who sprinkles the blood of the peace offerings.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,15);</script>The flesh of the
sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten on the
day of his offering. He shall not leave any of it until the morning.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,16);</script>“‘But if the
sacrifice of his offering is a vow, or a freewill offering, it shall be
eaten on the day that he offers his sacrifice; and on the next day what
remains of it shall be eaten: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,17);</script>but what remains of the flesh of
the sacrifice on the third day shall be burned with fire. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,18);</script>If any of the flesh of the
sacrifice of his peace offerings is eaten on the third day, it will not be
accepted, neither shall it be imputed to him who offers it. It will be an
abomination, and the soul who eats any of it will bear his iniquity.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,19);</script>“‘The flesh that
touches any unclean thing shall not be eaten. It shall be burned with
fire. As for the flesh, everyone who is clean may eat it; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,20);</script>but the soul who eats of the
flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, that belongs to Yahweh, having
his uncleanness on him, that soul shall be cut off from his people.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,21);</script>When anyone touches any
unclean thing, the uncleanness of man, or an unclean animal, or any
unclean abomination, and eats some of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace
offerings, which belong to Yahweh, that soul shall be cut off from his
people.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,22);</script>Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,23);</script>“Speak to the
children of Israel, saying, ‘You shall eat no fat, of bull, or sheep, or
goat. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,24);</script>The fat of that
which dies of itself, and the fat of that which is torn of animals, may be
used for any other service, but you shall in no way eat of it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,25);</script>For whoever eats the fat of the
animal, of which men offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh, even the
soul who eats it shall be cut off from his people. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,26);</script>You shall not eat any blood,
whether it is of bird or of animal, in any of your dwellings. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,27);</script>Whoever it is who eats any blood,
that soul shall be cut off from his people.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,28);</script>Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,29);</script>“Speak to the
children of Israel, saying, ‘He who offers the sacrifice of his peace
offerings to Yahweh shall bring his offering to Yahweh out of the
sacrifice of his peace offerings. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,30);</script>With his own hands he shall bring
the offerings of Yahweh made by fire. He shall bring the fat with the
breast, that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before Yahweh.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,31);</script>The priest shall burn the
fat on the altar, but the breast shall be Aaron’s and his sons’.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,32);</script>The right thigh you shall
give to the priest for a heave offering out of the sacrifices of your
peace offerings. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,33);</script>He among
the sons of Aaron who offers the blood of the peace offerings, and the
fat, shall have the right thigh for a portion. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,34);</script>For the waved breast and the
heaved thigh I have taken from the children of Israel out of the
sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them to Aaron the
priest and to his sons as their portion forever from the children of
Israel.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,35);</script>This is the anointing
portion of Aaron, and the anointing portion of his sons, out of the
offerings of Yahweh made by fire, in the day when he presented them to
minister to Yahweh in the priest’s office; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,36);</script>which Yahweh commanded to be
given them of the children of Israel, in the day that he anointed them. It
is their portion forever throughout their generations. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,37);</script>This is the law of the burnt
offering, of the meal offering, and of the sin offering, and of the
trespass offering, and of the consecration, and of the sacrifice of peace
offerings; <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,38);</script>which Yahweh
commanded Moses in Mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the children
of Israel to offer their offerings to Yahweh, in the wilderness of Sinai.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,1);</script>Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,2);</script>“Take Aaron and
his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and the bull
of the sin offering, and the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,3);</script>and assemble all the
congregation at the door of the Tent of Meeting.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,4);</script>Moses did as Yahweh
commanded him; and the congregation was assembled at the door of the Tent
of Meeting. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,5);</script>Moses said to
the congregation, “This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded to be
done.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,6);</script>Moses brought
Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,7);</script>He put the coat on him, tied the
sash on him, clothed him with the robe, put the ephod on him, and he tied
the skillfully woven band of the ephod on him, and fastened it to him with
it. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,8);</script>He placed the
breastplate on him; and in the breastplate he put the Urim and the
Thummim. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,9);</script>He set the turban
on his head; and on the turban, in front, he set the golden plate, the
holy crown; as Yahweh commanded Moses. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,10);</script>Moses took the anointing oil, and
anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it, and sanctified them.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,11);</script>He sprinkled it on the
altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its vessels, and the
basin and its base, to sanctify them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,12);</script>He poured some of the anointing
oil on Aaron’s head, and anointed him, to sanctify him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,13);</script>Moses brought Aaron’s sons, and
clothed them with coats, and tied sashes on them, and put headbands on
them; as Yahweh commanded Moses.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,14);</script>He brought the bull of
the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of
the bull of the sin offering. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,15);</script>He killed it; and Moses took the
blood, and put it around on the horns of the altar with his finger, and
purified the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar, and
sanctified it, to make atonement for it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,16);</script>He took all the fat that was on
the innards, and the cover of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their
fat; and Moses burned it on the altar. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,17);</script>But the bull, and its skin, and
its flesh, and its dung, he burned with fire outside the camp; as Yahweh
commanded Moses. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,18);</script>He
presented the ram of the burnt offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their
hands on the head of the ram. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,19);</script>He killed it; and Moses sprinkled
the blood around on the altar. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,20);</script>He cut the ram into its pieces;
and Moses burned the head, and the pieces, and the fat. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,21);</script>He washed the innards and the
legs with water; and Moses burned the whole ram on the altar. It was a
burnt offering for a pleasant aroma. It was an offering made by fire to
Yahweh; as Yahweh commanded Moses. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,22);</script>He presented the other ram, the
ram of consecration: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head
of the ram. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,23);</script>He killed it;
and Moses took some of its blood, and put it on the tip of Aaron’s right
ear, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right
foot. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,24);</script>He brought
Aaron’s sons; and Moses put some of the blood on the tip of their right
ear, and on the thumb of their right hand, and on the great toe of their
right foot; and Moses sprinkled the blood around on the altar. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,25);</script>He took the fat, and the fat
tail, and all the fat that was on the innards, and the cover of the liver,
and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right thigh; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,26);</script>and out of the basket of
unleavened bread, that was before Yahweh, he took one unleavened cake, and
one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and placed them on the fat, and on
the right thigh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,27);</script>He put
all these in Aaron’s hands and in his sons’ hands, and waved them for
a wave offering before Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,28);</script>Moses took them from their hands,
and burned them on the altar on the burnt offering. They were a
consecration for a pleasant aroma. It was an offering made by fire to
Yahweh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,29);</script>Moses took the
breast, and waved it for a wave offering before Yahweh. It was Moses’
portion of the ram of consecration, as Yahweh commanded Moses. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,30);</script>Moses took some of the anointing
oil, and some of the blood which was on the altar, and sprinkled it on
Aaron, on his garments, and on his sons, and on his sons’ garments with
him, and sanctified Aaron, his garments, and his sons, and his sons’
garments with him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,31);</script>Moses said to Aaron
and to his sons, “Boil the flesh at the door of the Tent of Meeting, and
there eat it and the bread that is in the basket of consecration, as I
commanded, saying, ‘Aaron and his sons shall eat it.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,32);</script>What remains of the flesh and of
the bread you shall burn with fire. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,33);</script>You shall not go out from the
door of the Tent of Meeting seven days, until the days of your
consecration are fulfilled: for he shall consecrate you seven days.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,34);</script>What has been done this
day, so Yahweh has commanded to do, to make atonement for you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,35);</script>You shall stay at the door of the
Tent of Meeting day and night seven days, and keep Yahweh’s command,
that you don’t die: for so I am commanded.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,36);</script>Aaron and his sons did all the
things which Yahweh commanded by Moses.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,1);</script>It happened on the
eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of
Israel; <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,2);</script>and he said to
Aaron, “Take a calf from the herd for a sin offering, and a ram for a
burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,3);</script>You shall speak to the children of
Israel, saying, ‘Take a male goat for a sin offering; and a calf and a
lamb, both a year old, without blemish, for a burnt offering; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,4);</script>and a bull and a ram for peace
offerings, to sacrifice before Yahweh; and a meal offering mixed with oil:
for today Yahweh appears to you.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,5);</script>They brought what Moses
commanded before the Tent of Meeting: and all the congregation drew near
and stood before Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,6);</script>Moses said, “This is the thing
which Yahweh commanded that you should do: and the glory of Yahweh shall
appear to you.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,7);</script>Moses
said to Aaron, “Draw near to the altar, and offer your sin offering, and
your burnt offering, and make atonement for yourself, and for the people;
and offer the offering of the people, and make atonement for them; as
Yahweh commanded.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,8);</script>So Aaron drew near to
the altar, and killed the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,9);</script>The sons of Aaron
presented the blood to him; and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put
it on the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the
altar: <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,10);</script>but the fat, and
the kidneys, and the cover from the liver of the sin offering, he burned
upon the altar; as Yahweh commanded Moses. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,11);</script>The flesh and the skin he burned
with fire outside the camp. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,12);</script>He killed the burnt offering; and
Aaron’s sons delivered the blood to him, and he sprinkled it around on
the altar. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,13);</script>They delivered
the burnt offering to him, piece by piece, and the head: and he burned
them upon the altar. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,14);</script>He
washed the innards and the legs, and burned them on the burnt offering on
the altar. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,15);</script>He presented
the people’s offering, and took the goat of the sin offering which was
for the people, and killed it, and offered it for sin, like the first.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,16);</script>He presented the burnt
offering, and offered it according to the ordinance. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,17);</script>He presented the meal offering,
and filled his hand from there, and burned it upon the altar, besides the
burnt offering of the morning. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,18);</script>He also killed the bull and the
ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people: and
Aaron’s sons delivered to him the blood, which he sprinkled around on
the altar, <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,19);</script>and the fat of
the bull and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covers the innards,
and the kidneys, and the cover of the liver: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,20);</script>and they put the fat upon the
breasts, and he burned the fat on the altar: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,21);</script>and the breasts and the right
thigh Aaron waved for a wave offering before Yahweh, as Moses commanded.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,22);</script>Aaron lifted up his hands
toward the people, and blessed them; and he came down from offering the
sin offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,23);</script>Moses and Aaron went
into the Tent of Meeting, and came out, and blessed the people: and the
glory of Yahweh appeared to all the people. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,24);</script>There came forth fire from before
Yahweh, and consumed the burnt offering and the fat upon the altar: and
when all the people saw it, they shouted, and fell on their faces.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,1);</script>Nadab and Abihu, the
sons of Aaron, each took his censer, and put fire in it, and laid incense
on it, and offered strange fire before Yahweh, which he had not commanded
them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,2);</script>And fire came forth
from before Yahweh, and devoured them, and they died before Yahweh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,3);</script>Then Moses said to
Aaron, “This is what Yahweh spoke of, saying,
<dl>
<dt>‘I will show myself holy to those who come near me,
<dd>and before all the people I will be glorified.’”
</dl>
<p>Aaron held his peace. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,4);</script>Moses called Mishael and
Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, “Draw
near, carry your brothers from before the sanctuary out of the camp.”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(10,5);</script>So they drew near, and
carried them in their coats out of the camp, as Moses had said.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,6);</script>Moses said to Aaron,
and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons, “Don’t let the hair of your
heads go loose, neither tear your clothes; that you don’t die, and that
he not be angry with all the congregation: but let your brothers, the
whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which Yahweh has kindled.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(10,7);</script>You shall not go out from
the door of the Tent of Meeting, lest you die; for the anointing oil of
Yahweh is on you.” They did according to the word of Moses.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,8);</script>Yahweh spoke to Aaron,
saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,9);</script>“Drink no wine
nor strong drink, you, nor your sons with you, when you go into the Tent
of Meeting, that you don’t die: it shall be a statute forever throughout
your generations: <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,10);</script>and
that you are to make a distinction between the holy and the common, and
between the unclean and the clean; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,11);</script>and that you are to teach the
children of Israel all the statutes which Yahweh has spoken to them by
Moses.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,12);</script>Moses spoke to Aaron,
and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons who were left, “Take the meal
offering that remains of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire, and eat it
without yeast beside the altar; for it is most holy; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,13);</script>and you shall eat it in a holy
place, because it is your portion, and your sons’ portion, of the
offerings of Yahweh made by fire: for so I am commanded. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,14);</script>The waved breast and the heaved
thigh you shall eat in a clean place, you, and your sons, and your
daughters with you: for they are given as your portion, and your sons’
portion, out of the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the children of
Israel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,15);</script>The heaved thigh
and the waved breast they shall bring with the offerings made by fire of
the fat, to wave it for a wave offering before Yahweh: and it shall be
yours, and your sons’ with you, as a portion forever; as Yahweh has
commanded.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,16);</script>Moses diligently
inquired about the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burned:
and he was angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar, the sons of Aaron who were
left, saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,17);</script>“Why
haven’t you eaten the sin offering in the place of the sanctuary, since
it is most holy, and he has given it you to bear the iniquity of the
congregation, to make atonement for them before Yahweh? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,18);</script>Behold, its blood was not
brought into the inner part of the sanctuary: you certainly should have
eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,19);</script>Aaron spoke to Moses,
“Behold, this day they have offered their sin offering and their burnt
offering before Yahweh; and such things as these have happened to me: and
if I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have been pleasing in the
sight of Yahweh?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,20);</script>When Moses heard
that, it was pleasing in his sight.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,1);</script>Yahweh spoke to Moses
and to Aaron, saying to them, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,2);</script>“Speak to the children of
Israel, saying, ‘These are the living things which you may eat among all
the animals that are on the earth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,3);</script>Whatever parts the hoof, and is
cloven-footed, and chews the cud among the animals, that you may eat.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,4);</script>“‘Nevertheless
these you shall not eat of those that chew the cud, or of those who part
the hoof: the camel, because he chews the cud but doesn’t have a parted
hoof, he is unclean to you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,5);</script>The coney, because he chews the
cud but doesn’t have a parted hoof, he is unclean to you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,6);</script>The hare, because she chews the
cud but doesn’t part the hoof, she is unclean to you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,7);</script>The pig, because he has a split
hoof, and is cloven-footed, but doesn’t chew the cud, he is unclean to
you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,8);</script>Of their flesh you
shall not eat, and their carcasses you shall not touch; they are unclean
to you.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,9);</script>“‘These you may
eat of all that are in the waters: whatever has fins and scales in the
waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, that you may eat. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,10);</script>All that don’t have fins and
scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and
of all the living creatures that are in the waters, they are an
abomination to you, <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,11);</script>and
you detest them. You shall not eat of their flesh, and you shall detest
their carcasses. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,12);</script>Whatever has no fins nor scales
in the waters, that is an abomination to you.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,13);</script>“‘These you shall
detest among the birds; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination:
the eagle, and the vulture, and the black vulture, <script

plague in the skin of the body: and if the hair in the plague has turned
white, and the appearance of the plague is deeper than the body’s skin,
it is the plague of leprosy; and the priest shall examine him, and
pronounce him unclean. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,4);</script>If
the bright spot is white in the skin of his body, and its appearance
isn’t deeper than the skin, and its hair hasn’t turned white, then the

the plague hasn’t spread in the skin, then the priest shall isolate him
for seven more days. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,6);</script>The
priest shall examine him again on the seventh day; and behold, if the

and be clean. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,7);</script>But if the
scab spreads on the skin, after he has shown himself to the priest for his
cleansing, he shall show himself to the priest again. <script

leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought to the priest; <script

him. Behold, if there is a white rising in the skin, and it has turned the
hair white, and there is raw flesh in the rising, <script

infected person from his head even to his feet, as far as it appears to
the priest; <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,13);</script>then the
priest shall examine him; and, behold, if the leprosy has covered all his
flesh, he shall pronounce him clean of the plague. It has all turned
white: he is clean. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,14);</script>But
whenever raw flesh appears in him, he shall be unclean. <script

flesh, and pronounce him unclean: the raw flesh is unclean. It is leprosy.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,16);</script>Or if the raw flesh
turns again, and is changed to white, then he shall come to the priest;

shown to the priest; <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,20);</script>and
the priest shall examine it; and behold, if its appearance is lower than
the skin, and its hair has turned white, then the priest shall pronounce
him unclean. It is the plague of leprosy. It has broken out in the boil.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,21);</script>But if the priest
examines it, and behold, there are no white hairs in it, and it isn’t
deeper than the skin, but is dim, then the priest shall isolate him seven
days. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,22);</script>If it spreads in
the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is a plague.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,23);</script>But if the bright spot
stays in its place, and hasn’t spread, it is the scar from the boil; and
the priest shall pronounce him clean.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,24);</script>“Or when the body
has a burn from fire on its skin, and the raw flesh of the burn becomes a
bright spot, reddish-white, or white, <script

it; and behold, if the hair in the bright spot has turned white, and its
appearance is deeper than the skin; it is leprosy. It has broken out in
the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is the plague
of leprosy. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,26);</script>But if the
priest examines it, and behold, there is no white hair in the bright spot,
and it isn’t lower than the skin, but is faded; then the priest shall
isolate him seven days. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,27);</script>The priest shall examine him on
the seventh day. If it has spread in the skin, then the priest shall
pronounce him unclean. It is the plague of leprosy. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,28);</script>If the bright spot stays in its
place, and hasn’t spread in the skin, but is faded, it is the swelling
from the burn, and the priest shall pronounce him clean; for it is the
scar from the burn.

woman has a plague on the head or on the beard, <script

the plague; and behold, if its appearance is deeper than the skin, and the
hair in it is yellow and thin, then the priest shall pronounce him
unclean: it is an itch, it is leprosy of the head or of the beard. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,31);</script>If the priest examines the
plague of itching, and behold, its appearance isn’t deeper than the
skin, and there is no black hair in it, then the priest shall isolate him

shall examine the plague; and behold, if the itch hasn’t spread, and
there is no yellow hair in it, and the appearance of the itch isn’t
deeper than the skin, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,33);</script>then he shall be shaved, but he
shall not shave the itch; and the priest shall shut him up who has the
itch seven more days. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,34);</script>On
the seventh day, the priest shall examine the itch; and behold, if the
itch hasn’t spread in the skin, and its appearance isn’t deeper than
the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean. He shall wash his
clothes, and be clean. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,35);</script>But if the itch spreads in the
skin after his cleansing, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,36);</script>then the priest shall examine
him; and behold, if the itch has spread in the skin, the priest shall not
look for the yellow hair; he is unclean. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,37);</script>But if in his eyes the itch is
arrested, and black hair has grown in it; the itch is healed, he is clean.
The priest shall pronounce him clean.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,38);</script>“When a man or a
woman has bright spots in the skin of the body, even white bright spots;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,39);</script>then the priest shall
examine them; and behold, if the bright spots on the skin of their body
are a dull white, it is a harmless rash, it has broken out in the skin; he
is clean.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,40);</script>“If a man’s hair
has fallen from his head, he is bald. He is clean. <script

the front part of his head, he is forehead bald. He is clean. <script

head, or the bald forehead, a reddish-white plague; it is leprosy breaking
out in his bald head, or his bald forehead. <script

him; and, behold, if the rising of the plague is reddish-white in his bald
head, or in his bald forehead, like the appearance of leprosy in the skin
of the flesh, <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,44);</script>he is a
leprous man. He is unclean. The priest shall surely pronounce him unclean.
His plague is on his head.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,45);</script>“The leper in whom
the plague is shall wear torn clothes, and the hair of his head shall hang
loose. He shall cover his upper lip, and shall cry, ‘Unclean!
Unclean!’ <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,46);</script>All the days

to the priest. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,50);</script>The
priest shall examine the plague, and isolate the plague seven days.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,51);</script>He shall examine the
plague on the seventh day. If the plague has spread in the garment, either
in the warp, or in the woof, or in the skin, whatever use the skin is used

that they wash the thing in which the plague is, and he shall isolate it
seven more days. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,55);</script>Then
the priest shall examine it, after the plague is washed; and behold, if
the plague hasn’t changed its color, and the plague hasn’t spread, it
is unclean; you shall burn it in the fire. It is a mildewed spot, whether
the bareness is inside or outside. <script

in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of

wash, if the plague has departed from them, then it shall be washed the

plague in the house.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,36);</script>The priest shall command that
they empty the house, before the priest goes in to examine the plague,
that all that is in the house not be made unclean: and afterward the
priest shall go in to inspect the house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,37);</script>He shall examine the plague; and
behold, if the plague is in the walls of the house with hollow streaks,
greenish or reddish, and it appears to be deeper than the wall; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,38);</script>then the priest shall go out of
the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(14,39);</script>The priest shall come
again on the seventh day, and look. If the plague has spread in the walls
of the house, <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,40);</script>then the
priest shall command that they take out the stones in which is the plague,
and cast them into an unclean place outside of the city: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,41);</script>and he shall cause the inside of
the house to be scraped all over, and they shall pour out the mortar, that
they scraped off, outside of the city into an unclean place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,42);</script>They shall take other stones,
and put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other mortar,
and shall plaster the house.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,43);</script>“If the plague
comes again, and breaks out in the house, after he has taken out the
stones, and after he has scraped the house, and after it was plastered;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(14,44);</script>then the priest shall
come in and look; and behold, if the plague has spread in the house, it is
a destructive mildew in the house. It is unclean. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,45);</script>He shall break down the house,
its stones, and its timber, and all the house’s mortar. He shall carry
them out of the city into an unclean place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,46);</script>“Moreover he who
goes into the house while it is shut up shall be unclean until the
evening. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,47);</script>He who lies
down in the house shall wash his clothes; and he who eats in the house
shall wash his clothes.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,48);</script>“If the priest
shall come in, and examine it, and behold, the plague hasn’t spread in
the house, after the house was plastered, then the priest shall pronounce
the house clean, because the plague is healed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,49);</script>To cleanse the house he shall
take two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,50);</script>He shall kill one of the birds
in an earthen vessel over running water. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,51);</script>He shall take the cedar wood,
and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the
blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house
seven times. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,52);</script>He shall
cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water,
with the living bird, with the cedar wood, with the hyssop, and with the
scarlet; <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,53);</script>but he shall
let the living bird go out of the city into the open field. So shall he
make atonement for the house; and it shall be clean.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,54);</script>This is the law for
any plague of leprosy, and for an itch, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,55);</script>and for the destructive mildew
of a garment, and for a house, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,56);</script>and for a rising, and for a
scab, and for a bright spot; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,57);</script>to teach when it is unclean, and
when it is clean.
<p> This is the law of leprosy.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,1);</script>Yahweh spoke to Moses

because of his discharge he is unclean. <script

into the Most Holy Place within the veil, before the mercy seat which is
on the ark; lest he die: for I will appear in the cloud on the mercy seat.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,3);</script>“Herewith shall
Aaron come into the sanctuary: with a young bull for a sin offering, and a
ram for a burnt offering. <script

<script type="text/javascript">cb(16,5);</script>He shall take from the
congregation of the children of Israel two male goats for a sin offering,

the bull of the sin offering, which is for himself, and make atonement for
himself and for his house. <script

set them before Yahweh at the door of the Tent of Meeting. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,8);</script>Aaron shall cast lots for the two
goats; one lot for Yahweh, and the other lot for the scapegoat. <script

fell for the scapegoat, shall be presented alive before Yahweh, to make
atonement for him, to send him away for the scapegoat into the wilderness.

the fire before Yahweh, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy

east; and before the mercy seat he shall sprinkle some of the blood with
his finger seven times.

the goat of the sin offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood
within the veil, and do with his blood as he did with the blood of the
bull, and sprinkle it on the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat:
<script type="text/javascript">cb(16,16);</script>and he shall make
atonement for the Holy Place, because of the uncleanness of the children

so he shall do for the Tent of Meeting, that dwells with them in the midst
of their uncleanness. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,17);</script>No
one shall be in the Tent of Meeting when he enters to make atonement in
the Holy Place, until he comes out, and has made atonement for himself and
for his household, and for all the assembly of Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,18);</script>“He shall go out to
the altar that is before Yahweh and make atonement for it, and shall take
some of the bull’s blood, and some of the goat’s blood, and put it
around on the horns of the altar. <script

blood on it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and make it holy
from the uncleanness of the children of Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,20);</script>“When he has made
an end of atoning for the Holy Place, the Tent of Meeting, and the altar,
he shall present the live goat. <script

on the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of
the children of Israel, and all their transgressions, even all their sins;

into the wilderness by the hand of a man who is in readiness. <script

iniquities on himself to a solitary land, and he shall let the goat go in
the wilderness.

himself in water in a holy place, and put on his garments, and come out
and offer his burnt offering and the burnt offering of the people, and
make atonement for himself and for the people. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,25);</script>The fat of the sin offering he
shall burn on the altar.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,26);</script>“He who lets the

water, and afterward he shall come into the camp. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,27);</script>The bull for the sin offering,
and the goat for the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make
atonement in the Holy Place, shall be carried forth outside the camp; and
they shall burn their skins, their flesh, and their dung with fire.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(16,28);</script>He who burns them shall
wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall
come into the camp.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,29);</script>“It shall be a

month, you shall afflict your souls, and shall do no kind of work, the

be made for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins you shall be clean
before Yahweh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,31);</script>It is a
Sabbath of solemn rest to you, and you shall afflict your souls; it is a
statute forever. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,32);</script>The

everlasting statute for you, to make atonement for the children of Israel
once in the year because of all their sins.”
<p>It was done as Yahweh commanded Moses.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,1);</script>Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,2);</script>“Speak to
Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel, and say to
them: ‘This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,3);</script>Whatever man there is of the
house of Israel, who kills a bull, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or who
kills it outside the camp, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,4);</script>and hasn’t brought it to the
door of the Tent of Meeting, to offer it as an offering to Yahweh before
the tabernacle of Yahweh: blood shall be imputed to that man. He has shed
blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,5);</script>This is to the end that the
children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they sacrifice in the
open field, that they may bring them to Yahweh, to the door of the Tent of
Meeting, to the priest, and sacrifice them for sacrifices of peace
offerings to Yahweh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,6);</script>The
priest shall sprinkle the blood on the altar of Yahweh at the door of the
Tent of Meeting, and burn the fat for a pleasant aroma to Yahweh. <script

their sacrifices to the goat idols, after which they play the prostitute.
This shall be a statute forever to them throughout their generations.’
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,8);</script>“You shall say to
them, ‘Any man there is of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who
live as foreigners among them, who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(17,9);</script>and doesn’t bring it to
the door of the Tent of Meeting, to sacrifice it to Yahweh; that man shall
be cut off from his people.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,10);</script>“‘Any man of the
house of Israel, or of the strangers who live as foreigners among them,
who eats any kind of blood, I will set my face against that soul who eats
blood, and will cut him off from among his people. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,11);</script>For the life of the flesh is in
the blood; and I have given it to you on the altar to make atonement for
your souls: for it is the blood that makes atonement by reason of the
life. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,12);</script>Therefore I have
said to the children of Israel, “No person among you shall eat blood,
neither shall any stranger who lives as a foreigner among you eat blood.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,13);</script>“‘Whatever man
there is of the children of Israel, or of the strangers who live as
foreigners among them, who takes in hunting any animal or bird that may be
eaten; he shall pour out its blood, and cover it with dust. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,14);</script>For as to the life of all flesh,
its blood is with its life: therefore I said to the children of Israel,
“You shall not eat the blood of any kind of flesh; for the life of all
flesh is its blood. Whoever eats it shall be cut off.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,15);</script>“‘Every person
that eats what dies of itself, or that which is torn by animals, whether
he is native-born or a foreigner, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe
himself in water, and be unclean until the evening: then he shall be
clean. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,16);</script>But if he
doesn’t wash them, or bathe his flesh, then he shall bear his
iniquity.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,1);</script>Yahweh said to Moses,

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,1);</script>Yahweh spoke to Moses,

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,1);</script>Yahweh said to Moses,

near to him: for his mother, for his father, for his son, for his
daughter, for his brother, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,3);</script>and for his virgin sister who is
near to him, who has had no husband; for her he may defile himself.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(21,4);</script>He shall not defile
himself, being a chief man among his people, to profane himself.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,5);</script>“‘They shall not
shave their heads, neither shall they shave off the corners of their
beards, nor make any cuttings in their flesh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,6);</script>They shall be holy to their God,
and not profane the name of their God; for they offer the offerings of
Yahweh made by fire, the bread of their God; therefore they shall be holy.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,7);</script>“‘They shall not
marry a woman who is a prostitute, or profane; neither shall they marry a
woman divorced from her husband: for he is holy to his God. <script

for he offers the bread of your God: he shall be holy to you: for I
Yahweh, who sanctify you, am holy.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,9);</script>“‘The daughter of
any priest, if she profanes herself by playing the prostitute, she
profanes her father: she shall be burned with fire.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,10);</script>“‘He who is the
high priest among his brothers, upon whose head the anointing oil is
poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not let the
hair of his head hang loose, nor tear his clothes; <script

dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,12);</script>neither shall he go out of the
sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the
anointing oil of his God is upon him. I am Yahweh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,13);</script>“‘He shall take a
wife in her virginity. <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,14);</script>A
widow, or one divorced, or a woman who has been defiled, or a prostitute,
these he shall not marry: but a virgin of his own people shall he take as
a wife. <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,15);</script>He shall not
profane his seed among his people: for I am Yahweh who sanctifies
him.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,16);</script>Yahweh spoke to
Moses, saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,17);</script>“Say to
Aaron, ‘None of your seed throughout their generations who has a
blemish, may approach to offer the bread of his God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,18);</script>For whatever man he is that has
a blemish, he shall not draw near: a blind man, or a lame, or he who has a
flat nose, or any deformity, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,19);</script>or a man who has an injured
foot, or an injured hand, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,20);</script>or hunchbacked, or a dwarf, or
one who has a defect in his eye, or an itching disease, or scabs, or who
has damaged testicles; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,21);</script>no man of the seed of Aaron the
priest who has a blemish, shall come near to offer the offerings of Yahweh
made by fire. Since he has a blemish, he shall not come near to offer the
bread of his God. <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,22);</script>He
shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(21,23);</script>He shall not come near
to the veil, nor come near to the altar, because he has a blemish; that he
may not profane my sanctuaries, for I am Yahweh who sanctifies them.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,24);</script>So Moses spoke to
Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,1);</script>Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,2);</script>“Tell Aaron and
his sons to separate themselves from the holy things of the children of
Israel, which they make holy to me, and that they not profane my holy
name. I am Yahweh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,3);</script>“Tell them, ‘If
anyone of all your seed throughout your generations approaches the holy
things, which the children of Israel make holy to Yahweh, having his
uncleanness on him, that soul shall be cut off from before me. I am Yahweh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,4);</script>“‘Whoever of the
seed of Aaron is a leper or has an issue; he shall not eat of the holy
things, until he is clean. Whoever touches anything that is unclean by the
dead, or a man whose seed goes from him; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,5);</script>or whoever touches any creeping
thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take
uncleanness, whatever uncleanness he has; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,6);</script>the person that touches any such
shall be unclean until the evening, and shall not eat of the holy things,
unless he bathe his body in water. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,7);</script>When the sun is down, he shall be
clean; and afterward he shall eat of the holy things, because it is his
bread. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,8);</script>That which dies of
itself, or is torn by animals, he shall not eat, defiling himself by it. I
am Yahweh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,9);</script>“‘They shall
therefore follow my requirements, lest they bear sin for it, and die
therein, if they profane it. I am Yahweh who sanctifies them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,10);</script>“‘No stranger
shall eat of the holy thing: a foreigner living with the priests, or a
hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,11);</script>But if a priest buys a slave,
purchased by his money, he shall eat of it; and such as are born in his
house, they shall eat of his bread. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,12);</script>If a priest’s daughter is
married to an outsider, she shall not eat of the heave offering of the
holy things. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,13);</script>But if a
priest’s daughter is a widow, or divorced, and has no child, and has
returned to her father’s house, as in her youth, she may eat of her
father’s bread: but no stranger shall eat any of it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,14);</script>“‘If a man eats
something holy unwittingly, then he shall add the fifth part of its value
to it, and shall give the holy thing to the priest. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,15);</script>The priests shall not profane
the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer to Yahweh,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(22,16);</script>and so cause them to
bear the iniquity that brings guilt, when they eat their holy things: for
I am Yahweh who sanctifies them.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,17);</script>Yahweh spoke to
Moses, saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,18);</script>“Speak
to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel, and say to
them, ‘Whoever is of the house of Israel, or of the foreigners in

of their freewill offerings, which they offer to Yahweh for a burnt
offering; <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,19);</script>that you may
be accepted, you shall offer a male without blemish, of the bulls, of the
sheep, or of the goats. <script

you shall not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,21);</script>Whoever offers a sacrifice of
peace offerings to Yahweh to accomplish a vow, or for a freewill offering,
of the herd or of the flock, it shall be perfect to be accepted; no
blemish shall be therein. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,22);</script>Blind, injured, maimed, having a
wart, festering, or having a running sore, you shall not offer these to
Yahweh, nor make an offering by fire of them on the altar to Yahweh.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(22,23);</script>Either a bull or a lamb
that has any deformity or lacking in his parts, that you may offer for a
freewill offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted. <script

their corruption is in them. There is a blemish in them. They shall not be

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,26);</script>Yahweh spoke to
Moses, saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,27);</script>“When a
bull, or a sheep, or a goat, is born, then it shall remain seven days with
its mother; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted

a sacrifice of thanksgiving to Yahweh, you shall sacrifice it so that you
may be accepted. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,30);</script>It

name, but I will be made holy among the children of Israel. I am Yahweh
who makes you holy, <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,33);</script>who
brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God. I am Yahweh.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,1);</script>Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,2);</script>“Speak to the
children of Israel, and tell them, ‘The set feasts of Yahweh, which you

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,23);</script>Yahweh spoke to

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,26);</script>Yahweh spoke to

to you, and you shall afflict yourselves; and you shall offer an offering

that same day; for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement for you

be a Sabbath of solemn rest for you, and you shall deny yourselves. In the
ninth day of the month at evening, from evening to evening, you shall keep
your Sabbath.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,33);</script>Yahweh spoke to
Moses, saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,34);</script>“Speak
to the children of Israel, and say, ‘On the fifteenth day of this
seventh month is the feast of tents for seven days to Yahweh. <script

fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the fruits
of the land, you shall keep the feast of Yahweh seven days: on the first

in booths seven days. All who are native-born in Israel shall dwell in
booths, <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,43);</script>that your
generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in
booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt. I am Yahweh your
God.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,44);</script>Moses declared to the
children of Israel the appointed feasts of Yahweh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,1);</script>Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,2);</script>“Command the
children of Israel, that they bring to you pure olive oil beaten for the
light, to cause a lamp to burn continually. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,3);</script>Outside of the veil of the
Testimony, in the Tent of Meeting, shall Aaron keep it in order from
evening to morning before Yahweh continually: it shall be a statute
forever throughout your generations. <script

on the pure gold lampstand before Yahweh continually.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,5);</script>“You shall take fine
flour, and bake twelve cakes of it: two tenth parts of an <a

type="text/javascript">cb(24,6);</script>You shall set them in two rows,
six on a row, on the pure gold table before Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,7);</script>You shall put pure frankincense
on each row, that it may be to the bread for a memorial, even an offering
made by fire to Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,8);</script>Every Sabbath day he shall set it
in order before Yahweh continually. It is on the behalf of the children of
Israel an everlasting covenant. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,9);</script>It shall be for Aaron and his
sons; and they shall eat it in a holy place: for it is most holy to him of
the offerings of Yahweh made by fire by a perpetual statute.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,10);</script>The son of an
Israelite woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children
of Israel; and the son of the Israelite woman and a man of Israel strove
together in the camp. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,11);</script>The son of the Israelite woman
blasphemed the Name, and cursed; and they brought him to Moses. His
mother’s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(24,12);</script>They put him in custody,
until the will of Yahweh should be declared to them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,13);</script>Yahweh spoke to
Moses, saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,14);</script>“Bring
out of the camp him who cursed; and let all who heard him lay their hands
on his head, and let all the congregation stone him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,15);</script>You shall speak to the children
of Israel, saying, ‘Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,16);</script>He who blasphemes the name of
Yahweh, he shall surely be put to death; all the congregation shall
certainly stone him: the foreigner as well as the native-born, when he
blasphemes the Name, shall be put to death.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,17);</script>“‘He who strikes
any man mortally shall surely be put to death. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,18);</script>He who strikes an animal
mortally shall make it good, life for life. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,19);</script>If anyone injures his neighbor;
as he has done, so shall it be done to him: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,20);</script>fracture for fracture, eye for
eye, tooth for tooth; as he has injured someone, so shall it be done to
him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,21);</script>He who kills an
animal shall make it good; and he who kills a man shall be put to death.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(24,22);</script>You shall have one kind
of law, for the foreigner as well as the native-born: for I am Yahweh your
God.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,23);</script>Moses spoke to the
children of Israel; and they brought out him who had cursed out of the
camp, and stoned him with stones. The children of Israel did as Yahweh
commanded Moses.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,1);</script>Yahweh said to Moses
in Mount Sinai, <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,2);</script>“Speak
to the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘When you come into the land
which I give you, then the land shall keep a Sabbath to Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,3);</script>Six years you shall sow your
field, and six years you shall prune your vineyard, and gather in its
fruits; <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,4);</script>but in the
seventh year there shall be a Sabbath of solemn rest for the land, a
Sabbath to Yahweh. You shall not sow your field or prune your vineyard.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(25,5);</script>What grows of itself in
your harvest you shall not reap, and the grapes of your undressed vine you
shall not gather. It shall be a year of solemn rest for the land. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,6);</script>The Sabbath of the land shall be
for food for you; for yourself, for your servant, for your maid, for your
hired servant, and for your stranger, who lives as a foreigner with you.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(25,7);</script>For your livestock also,
and for the animals that are in your land, shall all its increase be for
food.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,8);</script>“‘You shall count
off seven Sabbaths of years, seven times seven years; and there shall be
to you the days of seven Sabbaths of years, even forty-nine years. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,9);</script>Then you shall sound the loud
trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month. On the Day of Atonement you
shall sound the trumpet throughout all your land. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,10);</script>You shall make the fiftieth year
holy, and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It
shall be a jubilee to you; and each of you shall return to his own
property, and each of you shall return to his family. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,11);</script>That fiftieth year shall be a
jubilee to you. In it you shall not sow, neither reap that which grows of
itself, nor gather from the undressed vines. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,12);</script>For it is a jubilee; it shall be
holy to you. You shall eat of its increase out of the field.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,13);</script>“‘In this Year of
Jubilee each of you shall return to his property.

anything to your neighbor, or buy from your neighbor, you shall not wrong
one another. <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,15);</script>According
to the number of years after the Jubilee you shall buy from your neighbor.
According to the number of years of the crops he shall sell to you.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(25,16);</script>According to the length
of the years you shall increase its price, and according to the shortness
of the years you shall diminish its price; for he is selling the number of
the crops to you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,17);</script>You
shall not wrong one another; but you shall fear your God: for I am Yahweh
your God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,18);</script>“‘Therefore you
shall do my statutes, and keep my ordinances and do them; and you shall
dwell in the land in safety. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,19);</script>The land shall yield its fruit,
and you shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,20);</script>If you said, “What shall we
eat the seventh year? Behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our
increase”; <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,21);</script>then I will
command my blessing on you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth
fruit for the three years. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,22);</script>You shall sow the eighth year,
and eat of the fruits, the old store; until the ninth year, until its
fruits come in, you shall eat the old store.

not be sold in perpetuity, for the land is mine; for you are strangers and
live as foreigners with me. <script

possession you shall grant a redemption for the land.

becomes poor, and sells some of his possessions, then his kinsman who is
next to him shall come, and redeem that which his brother has sold.

redeem it, and he becomes prosperous and finds sufficient means to redeem
it; <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,27);</script>then let him reckon
the years since its sale, and restore the surplus to the man to whom he
sold it; and he shall return to his property. <script

back for himself, then what he has sold shall remain in the hand of him
who has bought it until the Year of Jubilee: and in the Jubilee it shall
be released, and he shall return to his property.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,29);</script>“‘If a man sells
a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole
year after it has been sold. For a full year he shall have the right of
redemption. <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,30);</script>If it
isn’t redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is
in the walled city shall be made sure in perpetuity to him who bought it,
throughout his generations. It shall not be released in the Jubilee.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(25,31);</script>But the houses of the
villages which have no wall around them shall be reckoned with the fields
of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall be released in the
Jubilee.

the cities of the Levites, the houses in the cities of their possession,
the Levites may redeem at any time. <script

that was sold, and the city of his possession, and it shall be released in
the Jubilee; for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their
possession among the children of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,34);</script>But the field of the suburbs of
their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,35);</script>“‘If your brother
has become poor, and his hand can’t support him among you; then you
shall uphold him. He shall live with you like an alien and a temporary

interest from him or profit, but fear your God; that your brother may live
among you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,37);</script>You shall not
lend him your money at interest, nor give him your food for profit.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(25,38);</script>I am Yahweh your God,

Canaan, and to be your God.

a hired servant, and as a temporary resident, he shall be with you; he
shall serve with you until the Year of Jubilee: <script

he and his children with him, and shall return to his own family, and to
the possession of his fathers. <script

brought out of the land of Egypt. They shall not be sold as slaves.

aliens who live among you, of them you may buy, and of their families who
are with you, which they have conceived in your land; and they will be
your property. <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,46);</script>You may
make them an inheritance for your children after you, to hold for a
possession; of them may you take your slaves forever: but over your

harshness.

redeemed. One of his brothers may redeem him; <script

son, may redeem him, or any who is a close relative to him of his family
may redeem him; or if he has grown rich, he may redeem himself. <script

bought him from the year that he sold himself to him to the Year of
Jubilee: and the price of his sale shall be according to the number of
years; according to the time of a hired servant shall he be with him.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(25,51);</script>If there are yet many
years, according to them he shall give back the price of his redemption
out of the money that he was bought for. <script

to the year of jubilee, then he shall reckon with him; according to his
years of service he shall give back the price of his redemption. <script

shall he be with him: he shall not rule with harshness over him in your
sight. <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,54);</script>If he isn’t
redeemed by these means, then he shall be released in the Year of Jubilee,
he, and his children with him. <script

sabbaths as long as it lies desolate and you are in your enemies’ land.
Even then the land will rest and enjoy its sabbaths. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,35);</script>As long as it lies desolate it
shall have rest, even the rest which it didn’t have in your sabbaths,
when you lived on it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,36);</script>“‘As for those of
you who are left, I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands
of their enemies: and the sound of a driven leaf will put them to flight;
and they shall flee, as one flees from the sword; and they will fall when
no one pursues. <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,37);</script>They
will stumble over one another, as it were before the sword, when no one
pursues: and you will have no power to stand before your enemies. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,38);</script>You will perish among the
nations, and the land of your enemies will eat you up. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,39);</script>Those of you who are left will
pine away in their iniquity in your enemies’ lands; and also in the
iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,40);</script>“‘If they confess
their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which
they trespassed against me, and also that, because they walked contrary to
me, <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,41);</script>I also walked
contrary to them, and brought them into the land of their enemies: if then
their uncircumcised heart is humbled, and they then accept the punishment
of their iniquity; <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,42);</script>then
I will remember my covenant with Jacob; and also my covenant with Isaac,
and also my covenant with Abraham; and I will remember the land. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,43);</script>The land also will be left by
them, and will enjoy its sabbaths while it lies desolate without them: and
they will accept the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because
they rejected my ordinances, and their soul abhorred my statutes. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,44);</script>Yet for all that, when they are
in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor
them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them; for I
am Yahweh their God; <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,45);</script>but
I will for their sake remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I
brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might
be their God. I am Yahweh.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,46);</script>These are the
statutes, ordinances and laws, which Yahweh made between him and the
children of Israel in Mount Sinai by Moses.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,1);</script>Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,2);</script>“Speak to the
children of Israel, and say to them, ‘When a man makes a vow, the
persons shall be for Yahweh by your valuation. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,3);</script>Your valuation shall be of a male
from twenty years old even to sixty years old, even your valuation shall
be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,4);</script>If it is a female, then your
valuation shall be thirty shekels. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,5);</script>If the person is from five years
old even to twenty years old, then your valuation shall be for a male
twenty shekels, and for a female ten shekels. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,6);</script>If the person is from a month old
even to five years old, then your valuation shall be for a male five
shekels of silver, and for a female your valuation shall be three shekels
of silver. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,7);</script>If the person
is from sixty years old and upward; if it is a male, then your valuation
shall be fifteen shekels, and for a female ten shekels. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,8);</script>But if he is poorer than your
valuation, then he shall be set before the priest, and the priest shall
value him; according to the ability of him who vowed shall the priest
value him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,9);</script>“‘If it is an
animal, of which men offer an offering to Yahweh, all that any man gives
of such to Yahweh becomes holy. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,10);</script>He shall not alter it, nor
change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all
change animal for animal, then both it and that for which it is changed
shall be holy. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,11);</script>If it is
any unclean animal, of which they do not offer as an offering to Yahweh,
then he shall set the animal before the priest; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,12);</script>and the priest shall value it,
whether it is good or bad. As you the priest values it, so shall it be.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(27,13);</script>But if he will indeed
redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of it to its valuation.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,14);</script>“‘When a man
dedicates his house to be holy to Yahweh, then the priest shall evaluate
it, whether it is good or bad: as the priest shall evaluate it, so shall
it stand. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,15);</script>If he who
dedicates it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of
the money of your valuation to it, and it shall be his.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,16);</script>“‘If a man
dedicates to Yahweh part of the field of his possession, then your
valuation shall be according to the seed for it: the sowing of a <a
href="#N11">homer</a> of barley shall be valued at fifty shekels of
silver. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,17);</script>If he dedicates
his field from the Year of Jubilee, according to your valuation it shall
stand. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,18);</script>But if he
dedicates his field after the Jubilee, then the priest shall reckon to him
the money according to the years that remain to the Year of Jubilee; and
an abatement shall be made from your valuation. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,19);</script>If he who dedicated the field
will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of
your valuation to it, and it shall remain his. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,20);</script>If he will not redeem the field,
or if he has sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any
more; <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,21);</script>but the field,
when it goes out in the Jubilee, shall be holy to Yahweh, as a field
devoted; it shall be owned by the priests.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,22);</script>“‘If he dedicates
to Yahweh a field which he has bought, which is not of the field of his
possession, <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,23);</script>then the
priest shall reckon to him the worth of your valuation up to the Year of
Jubilee; and he shall give your valuation on that day, as a holy thing to
Yahweh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,24);</script>In the Year of
Jubilee the field shall return to him from whom it was bought, even to him
to whom the possession of the land belongs. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,25);</script>All your valuations shall be
according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs to the shekel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,26);</script>“‘Only the
firstborn among animals, which is made a firstborn to Yahweh, no man may
dedicate it; whether an ox or sheep, it is Yahweh’s. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,27);</script>If it is an unclean animal, then
he shall buy it back according to your valuation, and shall add to it the
fifth part of it: or if it isn’t redeemed, then it shall be sold
according to your valuation.
<p><script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,28);</script>“‘Notwithstanding, no
devoted thing, that a man shall devote to Yahweh of all that he has,
whether of man or animal, or of the field of his possession, shall be sold
or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy to Yahweh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,29);</script>“‘No one devoted,
who shall be devoted from among men, shall be ransomed; he shall surely be
put to death.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,30);</script>“‘All the tithe
of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the trees,
is Yahweh’s. It is holy to Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,31);</script>If a man redeems anything of his
tithe, he shall add a fifth part to it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,32);</script>All the tithe of the herds or
the flocks, whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to
Yahweh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,33);</script>He shall not
search whether it is good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he
changes it at all, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be
holy. It shall not be redeemed.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,34);</script>These are the
commandments which Yahweh commanded Moses for the children of Israel on
Mount Sinai.
