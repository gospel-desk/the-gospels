The Good News According to Luke
</h1><p>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,1);</script>Since many have undertaken
to set in order a narrative concerning those matters which have been
fulfilled among us, <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,2);</script>even
as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word
delivered them to us, <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,3);</script>it
seemed good to me also, having traced the course of all things accurately
from the first, to write to you in order, most excellent Theophilus;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,4);</script>that you might know the
certainty concerning the things in which you were instructed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,5);</script>There was in the days
of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the
priestly division of Abijah. He had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and
her name was Elizabeth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,6);</script>They were both righteous before
God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and ordinances of the
Lord. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,7);</script>But they had no
child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they both were well advanced in
years. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,8);</script>Now it happened,
while he executed the priest’s office before God in the order of his
division, <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,9);</script>according to the
custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to enter into the temple of
the Lord and burn incense. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,10);</script>The whole multitude of the people
were praying outside at the hour of incense.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,11);</script>An angel of the Lord
appeared to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,12);</script>Zacharias was troubled
when he saw him, and fear fell upon him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,13);</script>But the angel said to him,
“Don’t be afraid, Zacharias, because your request has been heard, and
your wife, Elizabeth, will bear you a son, and you shall call his name
John. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,14);</script>You will have joy
and gladness; and many will rejoice at his birth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,15);</script>For he will be great in the sight
of the Lord, and he will drink no wine nor strong drink. He will be filled
with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,16);</script>He will turn many of the children
of Israel to the Lord, their God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,17);</script>He will go before him in the
spirit and power of Elijah, ‘to turn the hearts of the fathers to the
children,’ and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to prepare a
people prepared for the Lord.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,18);</script>Zacharias said to the
angel, “How can I be sure of this? For I am an old man, and my wife is
well advanced in years.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,19);</script>The angel answered
him, “I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God. I was sent to
speak to you, and to bring you this good news. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,20);</script>Behold, you will be silent and
not able to speak, until the day that these things will happen, because
you didn’t believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their proper
time.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,21);</script>The people were
waiting for Zacharias, and they marveled that he delayed in the temple.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,22);</script>When he came out, he
could not speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision in
the temple. He continued making signs to them, and remained mute. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,23);</script>It happened, when the days of his
service were fulfilled, he departed to his house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,24);</script>After these days Elizabeth, his
wife, conceived, and she hid herself five months, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,25);</script>“Thus has the Lord done to me
in the days in which he looked at me, to take away my reproach among
men.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,26);</script>Now in the sixth
month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee, named
Nazareth, <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,27);</script>to a virgin
pledged to be married to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of
David. The virgin’s name was Mary. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,28);</script>Having come in, the angel said to
her, “Rejoice, you highly favored one! The Lord is with you. Blessed are
you among women!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,29);</script>But when she saw him,
she was greatly troubled at the saying, and considered what kind of
salutation this might be. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,30);</script>The angel said to her, “Don’t
be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,31);</script>Behold, you will conceive in your
womb, and bring forth a son, and will call his name ‘Jesus.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,32);</script>He will be great, and will be
called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of
his father, David, <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,33);</script>and he
will reign over the house of Jacob forever. There will be no end to his
Kingdom.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,34);</script>Mary said to the
angel, “How can this be, seeing I am a virgin?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,35);</script>The angel answered
her, “The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High
will overshadow you. Therefore also the holy one who is born from you will
be called the Son of God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,36);</script>Behold, Elizabeth, your relative,
also has conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with
her who was called barren. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,37);</script>For everything spoken by God is
possible.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,38);</script>Mary said, “Behold,
the handmaid of the Lord; be it to me according to your word.”
<p>The angel departed from her. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,39);</script>Mary arose in those days and went
into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,40);</script>and entered into the house of
Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,41);</script>It happened, when Elizabeth heard
Mary’s greeting, that the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was
filled with the Holy Spirit. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,42);</script>She called out with a loud voice,
and said, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your
womb! <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,43);</script>Why am I so
favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,44);</script>For behold, when the voice of
your greeting came into my ears, the baby leaped in my womb for joy!
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,45);</script>Blessed is she who
believed, for there will be a fulfillment of the things which have been
spoken to her from the Lord!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,46);</script>Mary said,
<dl>
<dt>“My soul magnifies the Lord.
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,47);</script>My spirit has
rejoiced in God my Savior,
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,48);</script>for he has looked at
the humble state of his handmaid.
<dt>For behold, from now on, all generations will call me blessed.
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,49);</script>For he who is mighty
has done great things for me.
<dd>Holy is his name.
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,50);</script>His mercy is for
generations of generations on those who fear him.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,51);</script>He has shown strength
with his arm.
<dd>He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,52);</script>He has put down
princes from their thrones.
<dd>And has exalted the lowly.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,53);</script>He has filled the
hungry with good things.
<dd>He has sent the rich away empty.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,54);</script>He has given help to
Israel, his servant, that he might remember mercy,
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,55);</script>As he spoke to our
fathers,
<dd>to Abraham and his seed forever.”
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,56);</script>Mary stayed with her
about three months, and then returned to her house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,57);</script>Now the time that Elizabeth
should give birth was fulfilled, and she brought forth a son. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,58);</script>Her neighbors and her relatives
heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy towards her, and they rejoiced
with her. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,59);</script>It happened on
the eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child; and they would
have called him Zacharias, after the name of the father. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,60);</script>His mother answered, “Not so;
but he will be called John.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,61);</script>They said to her,
“There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name.”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,62);</script>They made signs to his
father, what he would have him called.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,63);</script>He asked for a writing
tablet, and wrote, “His name is John.”
<p>They all marveled. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,64);</script>His
mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue freed, and he spoke, blessing
God. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,65);</script>Fear came on all who
lived around them, and all these sayings were talked about throughout all
the hill country of Judea. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,66);</script>All who heard them laid them up
in their heart, saying, “What then will this child be?” The hand of
the Lord was with him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,67);</script>His father, Zacharias, was filled
with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,
<dl>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,68);</script>“Blessed be the
Lord, the God of Israel,
<dd>for he has visited and worked redemption for his people;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,69);</script>and has raised up a
horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,70);</script>(as he spoke by the
mouth of his holy prophets who have been from of old),
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,71);</script>salvation from our
enemies, and from the hand of all who hate us;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,72);</script>to show mercy towards
our fathers,
<dd>to remember his holy covenant,
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,73);</script>the oath which he
spoke to Abraham, our father,
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,74);</script>to grant to us that
we, being delivered out of the hand of our enemies,
<dd>should serve him without fear,
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,75);</script>In holiness and
righteousness before him all the days of our life.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,76);</script>And you, child, will
be called a prophet of the Most High,
<dd>for you will go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways,
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,77);</script>to give knowledge of
salvation to his people by the remission of their sins,
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,78);</script>because of the tender
mercy of our God,
<dd>whereby the dawn from on high will visit us,
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,79);</script>to shine on those who
sit in darkness and the shadow of death;
<dd>to guide our feet into the way of peace.”
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,80);</script>The child was growing,
and becoming strong in spirit, and was in the desert until the day of his
public appearance to Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,1);</script>Now it happened in
those days, that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world
should be enrolled. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,2);</script>This
was the first enrollment made when Quirinius was governor of Syria.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,3);</script>All went to enroll
themselves, everyone to his own city. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,4);</script>Joseph also went up from Galilee,
out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of David, which is
called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,5);</script>to enroll himself with Mary, who
was pledged to be married to him as wife, being pregnant.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,6);</script>It happened, while they
were there, that the day had come that she should give birth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,7);</script>She brought forth her firstborn
son, and she wrapped him in bands of cloth, and laid him in a feeding
trough, because there was no room for them in the inn. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,8);</script>There were shepherds in the same
country staying in the field, and keeping watch by night over their flock.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,9);</script>Behold, an angel of the
Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they
were terrified. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,10);</script>The angel
said to them, “Don’t be afraid, for behold, I bring you good news of
great joy which will be to all the people. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,11);</script>For there is born to you, this
day, in the city of David, a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,12);</script>This is the sign to you: you will
find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth, lying in a feeding trough.”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,13);</script>Suddenly, there was with
the angel a multitude of the heavenly army praising God, and saying,
<dl>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,14);</script>“Glory to God in
the highest,
<dd>on earth peace, good will toward men.”
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,15);</script>It happened, when the
angels went away from them into the sky, that the shepherds said one to
another, “Let’s go to Bethlehem, now, and see this thing that has
happened, which the Lord has made known to us.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,16);</script>They came with haste, and found
both Mary and Joseph, and the baby was lying in the feeding trough.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,17);</script>When they saw it, they
publicized widely the saying which was spoken to them about this child.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,18);</script>All who heard it wondered
at the things which were spoken to them by the shepherds. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,19);</script>But Mary kept all these sayings,
pondering them in her heart. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,20);</script>The shepherds returned,
glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and
seen, just as it was told them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,21);</script>When eight days were
fulfilled for the circumcision of the child, his name was called Jesus,
which was given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,22);</script>When the days of their
purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought
him up to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,23);</script>(as it is written in the law of
the Lord, “Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the
Lord”),<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N1">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,24);</script>and to offer a sacrifice
according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, “A pair of
turtledoves, or two young pigeons.”<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N2">*</a></sup></font>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,25);</script>Behold, there was a
man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. This man was righteous and devout,
looking for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was on him.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,26);</script>It had been revealed to
him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the
Lord’s <a href="#N3">Christ.</a> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,27);</script>He came in the Spirit into the
temple. When the parents brought in the child, Jesus, that they might do
concerning him according to the custom of the law, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,28);</script>then he received him into his
arms, and blessed God, and said,
<dl>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,29);</script>“Now you are
releasing your servant, Master,
<dd>according to your word, in peace;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,30);</script>for my eyes have seen
your salvation,
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,31);</script>which you have
prepared before the face of all peoples;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,32);</script>a light for
revelation to the nations,
<dd>and the glory of your people Israel.”
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,33);</script>Joseph and his mother
were marveling at the things which were spoken concerning him, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,34);</script>and Simeon blessed them, and said
to Mary, his mother, “Behold, this child is set for the falling and the
rising of many in Israel, and for a sign which is spoken against. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,35);</script>Yes, a sword will pierce through
your own soul, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,36);</script>There was one Anna, a
prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher (she was of a
great age, having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,37);</script>and she had been a widow
for about eighty-four years), who didn’t depart from the temple,
worshipping with fastings and petitions night and day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,38);</script>Coming up at that very hour, she
gave thanks to the Lord, and spoke of him to all those who were looking
for redemption in Jerusalem.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,39);</script>When they had
accomplished all things that were according to the law of the Lord, they
returned into Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,40);</script>The child was growing, and was
becoming strong in spirit, being filled with wisdom, and the grace of God
was upon him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,41);</script>His parents
went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,42);</script>When he was twelve
years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,43);</script>and when they had
fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in
Jerusalem. Joseph and his mother didn’t know it, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,44);</script>but supposing him to be in the
company, they went a day’s journey, and they looked for him among their
relatives and acquaintances. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,45);</script>When they didn’t find him, they
returned to Jerusalem, looking for him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,46);</script>It happened after three days they
found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both
listening to them, and asking them questions. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,47);</script>All who heard him were amazed at
his understanding and his answers. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,48);</script>When they saw him, they were
astonished, and his mother said to him, “Son, why have you treated us
this way? Behold, your father and I were anxiously looking for you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,49);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Why were you looking for me? Didn’t you know that I must be
in my Father’s house?”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,50);</script>They didn’t understand the
saying which he spoke to them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,51);</script>And he went down with them, and
came to Nazareth. He was subject to them, and his mother kept all these
sayings in her heart. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,52);</script>And
Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,1);</script>Now in the fifteenth
year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of
Judea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip
tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch
of Abilene, <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,2);</script>in the high
priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John, the son of
Zacharias, in the wilderness. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,3);</script>He came into all the region around
the Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for remission of sins.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,4);</script>As it is written in the
book of the words of Isaiah the prophet,
<dl>
<dt>“The voice of one crying in the wilderness,
<dd>‘Make ready the way of the Lord.
<dt>Make his paths straight.
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,5);</script>Every valley will be
filled.
<dt>Every mountain and hill will be brought low.
<dd>The crooked will become straight,
<dd>and the rough ways smooth.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,6);</script>All flesh will see
God’s salvation.’”<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N4">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,7);</script>He said therefore to
the multitudes who went out to be baptized by him, “You offspring of
vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,8);</script>Bring forth therefore fruits
worthy of repentance, and don’t begin to say among yourselves, ‘We
have Abraham for our father;’ for I tell you that God is able to raise
up children to Abraham from these stones! <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,9);</script>Even now the axe also lies at the
root of the trees. Every tree therefore that doesn’t bring forth good
fruit is cut down, and thrown into the fire.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,10);</script>The multitudes asked
him, “What then must we do?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,11);</script>He answered them,
“He who has two coats, let him give to him who has none. He who has
food, let him do likewise.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,12);</script>Tax collectors also
came to be baptized, and they said to him, “Teacher, what must we do?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,13);</script>He said to them,
“Collect no more than that which is appointed to you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,14);</script>Soldiers also asked
him, saying, “What about us? What must we do?”
<p>He said to them, “Extort from no one by violence, neither accuse
anyone wrongfully. Be content with your wages.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,15);</script>As the people were in
expectation, and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning John, whether
perhaps he was the Christ, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,16);</script>John answered them all, “I
indeed baptize you with water, but he comes who is mightier than I, the
latchet of whose sandals I am not worthy to loosen. He will baptize you in
the Holy Spirit and fire, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,17);</script>whose fan is in his hand, and he
will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor, and will gather the wheat
into his barn; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,18);</script>Then with many other
exhortations he preached good news to the people, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,19);</script>but Herod the tetrarch, being
reproved by him for Herodias, his <a href="#N5">brother’s</a> wife, and
for all the evil things which Herod had done, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,20);</script>added this also to them all, that
he shut up John in prison. <script

people were baptized, Jesus also had been baptized, and was praying. The
sky was opened, <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,22);</script>and the
Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form as a dove on him; and a voice came
out of the sky, saying “You are my beloved Son. In you I am well
pleased.”

they were completed, he was hungry. <script

the surrounding area. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,15);</script>He
taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,16);</script>He came to Nazareth,
where he had been brought up. He entered, as was his custom, into the
synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,17);</script>The book of the prophet Isaiah
was handed to him. He opened the book, and found the place where it was
written,

class="j">“The Spirit of the Lord is on me,

</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,20);</script>He closed the book,
gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of all in the
synagogue were fastened on him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,21);</script>He began to tell them, <span
class="j">“Today, this Scripture has been fulfilled in your
hearing.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,22);</script>All testified about
him, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth,
and they said, “Isn’t this Joseph’s son?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,23);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Doubtless you will tell me this parable, ‘Physician, heal
yourself! Whatever we have heard done at Capernaum, do also here in your
hometown.’”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,24);</script>He
said, <span class="j">“Most certainly I tell you, no prophet is
acceptable in his hometown. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(4,25);</script>But truly I tell you, there were
many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut up
three years and six months, when a great famine came over all the land.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(4,26);</script>Elijah was sent to none
of them, except to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a
widow. <script type="text/javascript">cj(4,27);</script>There were many
lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them
was cleansed, except Naaman, the Syrian.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,28);</script>They were all filled
with wrath in the synagogue, as they heard these things. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,29);</script>They rose up, threw him out of
the city, and led him to the brow of the hill that their city was built
on, that they might throw him off the cliff. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,30);</script>But he, passing through their
midst, went his way.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,31);</script>He came down to
Capernaum, a city of Galilee. He was teaching them on the Sabbath day,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,32);</script>and they were astonished
at his teaching, for his word was with authority. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,33);</script>In the synagogue there was a man
who had a spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,34);</script>saying, “Ah! what have
we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know
you who you are: the Holy One of God!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,35);</script>Jesus rebuked him,
saying, <span class="j">“Be silent, and come out of him!”</span> When
the demon had thrown him down in their midst, he came out of him, having
done him no harm.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,36);</script>Amazement came on all,
and they spoke together, one with another, saying, “What is this word?
For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they
come out!” <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,37);</script>News about
him went out into every place of the surrounding region.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,38);</script>He rose up from the
synagogue, and entered into Simon’s house. Simon’s mother-in-law was
afflicted with a great fever, and they begged him for her. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,39);</script>He stood over her, and rebuked
the fever; and it left her. Immediately she rose up and served them.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,40);</script>When the sun was setting,
all those who had any sick with various diseases brought them to him; and
he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,41);</script>Demons also came out from many,
crying out, and saying, “You are the Christ, the Son of God!” Rebuking
them, he didn’t allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the
Christ.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,42);</script>When it was day, he
departed and went into an uninhabited place, and the multitudes looked for
him, and came to him, and held on to him, so that he wouldn’t go away
from them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,43);</script>But he said to
them, <span class="j">“I must preach the good news of the Kingdom of God
to the other cities also. For this reason I have been sent.”</span>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,44);</script>He was preaching in the
synagogues of Galilee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,1);</script>Now it happened, while
the multitude pressed on him and heard the word of God, that he was
standing by the lake of Gennesaret. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,2);</script>He saw two boats standing by the
lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them, and were washing their nets.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(5,3);</script>He entered into one of the
boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him to put out a little from the
land. He sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,4);</script>When he had finished speaking, he
said to Simon, <span class="j">“Put out into the deep, and let down your
nets for a catch.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,5);</script>Simon answered him,
“Master, we worked all night, and took nothing; but at your word I will
let down the net.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,6);</script>When
they had done this, they caught a great multitude of fish, and their net
was breaking. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,7);</script>They
beckoned to their partners in the other boat, that they should come and
help them. They came, and filled both boats, so that they began to sink.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(5,8);</script>But Simon Peter, when he
saw it, fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, “Depart from me, for I am a
sinful man, Lord.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,9);</script>For
he was amazed, and all who were with him, at the catch of fish which they
had caught; <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,10);</script>and so also
were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon.
<p>Jesus said to Simon, <span class="j">“Don’t be afraid. From now on
you will be catching people alive.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,11);</script>When they had brought
their boats to land, they left everything, and followed him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,12);</script>It happened, while he was in one
of the cities, behold, there was a man full of leprosy. When he saw Jesus,
he fell on his face, and begged him, saying, “Lord, if you want to, you
can make me clean.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,13);</script>He stretched out his
hand, and touched him, saying, <span class="j">“I want to. Be made
clean.”</span>
<p>Immediately the leprosy left him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,14);</script>He commanded him to tell no one,
<span class="j">“But go your way, and show yourself to the priest, and
offer for your cleansing according to what Moses commanded, for a
testimony to them.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,15);</script>But the report concerning him
spread much more, and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be
healed by him of their infirmities. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,16);</script>But he withdrew himself into the
desert, and prayed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,17);</script>It happened on one of
those days, that he was teaching; and there were Pharisees and teachers of
the law sitting by, who had come out of every village of Galilee, Judea,
and Jerusalem. The power of the Lord was with him to heal them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,18);</script>Behold, men brought a paralyzed
man on a cot, and they sought to bring him in to lay before Jesus. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,19);</script>Not finding a way to bring him in
because of the multitude, they went up to the housetop, and let him down
through the tiles with his cot into the midst before Jesus. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,20);</script>Seeing their faith, he said to
him, <span class="j">“Man, your sins are forgiven you.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,21);</script>The scribes and the
Pharisees began to reason, saying, “Who is this that speaks blasphemies?
Who can forgive sins, but God alone?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,22);</script>But Jesus, perceiving
their thoughts, answered them, <span class="j">“Why are you reasoning so
in your hearts? <script type="text/javascript">cj(5,23);</script>Which is
easier to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you;’ or to say, ‘Arise and
walk?’ <script type="text/javascript">cj(5,24);</script>But that you may
know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”</span>
(he said to the paralyzed man), <span class="j">“I tell you, arise, and
take up your cot, and go to your house.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,25);</script>Immediately he rose up
before them, and took up that which he was laying on, and departed to his
house, glorifying God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,26);</script>Amazement took hold on all, and
they glorified God. They were filled with fear, saying, “We have seen
strange things today.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,27);</script>After these things he
went out, and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax office,
and said to him, <span class="j">“Follow me!”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,28);</script>He left everything,
and rose up and followed him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,29);</script>Levi made a great feast for him
in his house. There was a great crowd of tax collectors and others who
were reclining with them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,30);</script>Their scribes and the Pharisees
murmured against his disciples, saying, “Why do you eat and drink with
the tax collectors and sinners?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,31);</script>Jesus answered them, <span
class="j">“Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those
who are sick do. <script type="text/javascript">cj(5,32);</script>I have
not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,33);</script>They said to him,
“Why do John’s disciples often fast and pray, likewise also the
disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,34);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast, while the
bridegroom is with them? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,35);</script>But the days will come when the
bridegroom will be taken away from them. Then they will fast in those
days.”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,36);</script>He also
told a parable to them. <span class="j">“No one puts a piece from a new
garment on an old garment, or else he will tear the new, and also the
piece from the new will not match the old. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,37);</script>No one puts new wine into old
wineskins, or else the new wine will burst the skins, and it will be
spilled, and the skins will be destroyed. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,38);</script>But new wine must be put into
fresh wineskins, and both are preserved. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(5,39);</script>No man having drunk old wine
immediately desires new, for he says, ‘The old is better.’”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,1);</script>Now it happened on the
second Sabbath after the first, that he was going through the grain
fields. His disciples plucked the heads of grain, and ate, rubbing them in
their hands. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,2);</script>But some of
the Pharisees said to them, “Why do you do that which is not lawful to
do on the Sabbath day?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,3);</script>Jesus, answering them,
said, <span class="j">“Haven’t you read what David did when he was
hungry, he, and those who were with him; <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,4);</script>how he entered into God’s house,
and took and ate the show bread, and gave also to those who were with him,
which is not lawful to eat except for the priests alone?”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,5);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,6);</script>It also happened on
another Sabbath that he entered into the synagogue and taught. There was a
man there, and his right hand was withered. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,7);</script>The scribes and the Pharisees
watched him, to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath, that they might
find an accusation against him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,8);</script>But he knew their thoughts; and he
said to the man who had the withered hand, <span class="j">“Rise up, and
stand in the middle.”</span> He arose and stood. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,9);</script>Then Jesus said to them, <span
class="j">“I will ask you something: Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do
good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to kill?”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,10);</script>He looked around at them all, and
said to the man, <span class="j">“Stretch out your hand.”</span> He
did, and his hand was restored as sound as the other. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,11);</script>But they were filled with rage,
and talked with one another about what they might do to Jesus.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,12);</script>It happened in these
days, that he went out to the mountain to pray, and he continued all night
in prayer to God. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,13);</script>When it
was day, he called his disciples, and from them he chose twelve, whom he
also named apostles: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,14);</script>Simon, whom he also named Peter;
Andrew, his brother; James; John; Philip; Bartholomew; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,15);</script>Matthew; Thomas; James, the son
of Alphaeus; Simon, who was called the Zealot; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,16);</script>Judas the son of James; and Judas
Iscariot, who also became a traitor. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,17);</script>He came down with them, and stood
on a level place, with a crowd of his disciples, and a great number of the
people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon,
who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,18);</script>as well as those who were
troubled by unclean spirits, and they were being healed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,19);</script>All the multitude sought to touch
him, for power came out from him and healed them all.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,20);</script>He lifted up his eyes
to his disciples, and said,

type="text/javascript">cj(6,41);</script>Why do you see the speck of chaff
that is in your brother’s eye, but don’t consider the beam that is in
your own eye? <script type="text/javascript">cj(6,42);</script>Or how can
you tell your brother, ‘Brother, let me remove the speck of chaff that
is in your eye,’ when you yourself don’t see the beam that is in your
own eye? You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye, and then
you can see clearly to remove the speck of chaff that is in your
brother’s eye. <script type="text/javascript">cj(6,43);</script>For
there is no good tree that brings forth rotten fruit; nor again a rotten
tree that brings forth good fruit. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,44);</script>For each tree is known by its own
fruit. For people don’t gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather
grapes from a bramble bush. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,45);</script>The good man out of the good
treasure of his heart brings out that which is good, and the evil man out
of the evil treasure of his heart brings out that which is evil, for out
of the abundance of the heart, his mouth speaks.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,46);</script>“Why do you call me, ‘Lord,
Lord,’ and don’t do the things which I say? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,47);</script>Everyone who comes to me, and
hears my words, and does them, I will show you who he is like. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,48);</script>He is like a man building a
house, who dug and went deep, and laid a foundation on the rock. When a
flood arose, the stream broke against that house, and could not shake it,
because it was founded on the rock. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,49);</script>But he who hears, and doesn’t
do, is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation,
against which the stream broke, and immediately it fell, and the ruin of
that house was great.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,1);</script>After he had finished
speaking in the hearing of the people, he entered into Capernaum. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,2);</script>A certain centurion’s servant,
who was dear to him, was sick and at the point of death. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,3);</script>When he heard about Jesus, he sent
to him elders of the Jews, asking him to come and save his servant.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,4);</script>When they came to Jesus,
they begged him earnestly, saying, “He is worthy for you to do this for
him, <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,5);</script>for he loves our
nation, and he built our synagogue for us.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,6);</script>Jesus went with them. When he was
now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to
him, “Lord, don’t trouble yourself, for I am not worthy for you to
come under my roof. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,7);</script>Therefore I didn’t even think
myself worthy to come to you; but say the word, and my servant will be
healed. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,8);</script>For I also am a
man placed under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one,
‘Go!’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come!’ and he comes; and to my
servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,9);</script>When Jesus heard these
things, he marveled at him, and turned and said to the multitude who
followed him, <span class="j">“I tell you, I have not found such great
faith, no, not in Israel.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,10);</script>Those who were sent, returning to
the house, found that the servant who had been sick was well.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,11);</script>It happened soon
afterwards, that he went to a city called Nain. Many of his disciples,
along with a great multitude, went with him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,12);</script>Now when he drew near to the gate
of the city, behold, one who was dead was carried out, the only son of his
mother, and she was a widow. Many people of the city were with her.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,13);</script>When the Lord saw her, he
had compassion on her, and said to her, <span class="j">“Don’t
cry.”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,14);</script>He came
near and touched the coffin, and the bearers stood still. He said, <span
class="j">“Young man, I tell you, arise!”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,15);</script>He who was dead sat up, and began
to speak. And he gave him to his mother.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,16);</script>Fear took hold of all,
and they glorified God, saying, “A great prophet has arisen among us!”
and, “God has visited his people!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,17);</script>This report went out concerning
him in the whole of Judea, and in all the surrounding region.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,18);</script>The disciples of John
told him about all these things. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,19);</script>John, calling to himself two of
his disciples, sent them to Jesus, saying, “Are you the one who is
coming, or should we look for another?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,20);</script>When the men had come to him,
they said, “John the Baptizer has sent us to you, saying, ‘Are you he
who comes, or should we look for another?’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,21);</script>In that hour he cured
many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits; and to many who were blind
he gave sight. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,22);</script>Jesus
answered them, <span class="j">“Go and tell John the things which you
have seen and heard: that the blind receive their sight, the lame walk,
the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the
poor have good news preached to them. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(7,23);</script>Blessed is he who finds no
occasion for stumbling in me.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,24);</script>When John’s
messengers had departed, he began to tell the multitudes about John, <span
class="j">“What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken
by the wind? <script type="text/javascript">cj(7,25);</script>But what did
you go out to see? A man clothed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are
gorgeously dressed, and live delicately, are in kings’ courts. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(7,26);</script>But what did you go out to see? A
prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(7,27);</script>This is he of whom it is written,</span>

</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(7,28);</script>“For I tell you, among those
who are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the
Baptizer, yet he who is least in the Kingdom of God is greater than
he.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,29);</script>When all the people
and the tax collectors heard this, they declared God to be just, having
been baptized with John’s baptism. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,30);</script>But the Pharisees and the lawyers
rejected the counsel of God, not being baptized by him themselves.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,31);</script><font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N17">*</a></sup></font><span class="j">“To what
then will I liken the people of this generation? What are they like?

who sit in the marketplace, and call one to another, saying, ‘We piped
to you, and you didn’t dance. We mourned, and you didn’t weep.’
<script type="text/javascript">cj(7,33);</script>For John the Baptizer
came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, ‘He has a
demon.’ <script type="text/javascript">cj(7,34);</script>The Son of Man
has come eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Behold, a gluttonous man,
and a drunkard; a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(7,35);</script>Wisdom is justified by all her
children.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,36);</script>One of the Pharisees
invited him to eat with him. He entered into the Pharisee’s house, and
sat at the table. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,37);</script>Behold,
a woman in the city who was a sinner, when she knew that he was reclining
in the Pharisee’s house, she brought an alabaster jar of ointment.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,38);</script>Standing behind at his
feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and she wiped them
with the hair of her head, kissed his feet, and anointed them with the
ointment. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,39);</script>Now when the
Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he said to himself, “This man, if
he were a prophet, would have perceived who and what kind of woman this is
who touches him, that she is a sinner.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,40);</script>Jesus answered him,
<span class="j">“Simon, I have something to tell you.”</span>
<p>He said, “Teacher, say on.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,41);</script><span class="j">“A
certain lender had two debtors. The one owed five hundred denarii, and the
other fifty. <script type="text/javascript">cj(7,42);</script>When they
couldn’t pay, he forgave them both. Which of them therefore will love
him most?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,43);</script>Simon answered, “He,
I suppose, to whom he forgave the most.”
<p>He said to him, <span class="j">“You have judged correctly.”</span>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,44);</script>Turning to the woman, he
said to Simon, <span class="j">“Do you see this woman? I entered into
your house, and you gave me no water for my feet, but she has wet my feet
with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(7,45);</script>You gave me no kiss, but she,
since the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss my feet. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(7,46);</script>You didn’t anoint my head with
oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(7,47);</script>Therefore I tell you, her sins,
which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is
forgiven, the same loves little.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,48);</script>He said to her, <span
class="j">“Your sins are forgiven.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,49);</script>Those who sat at the
table with him began to say to themselves, “Who is this who even
forgives sins?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,50);</script>He said to the woman,
<span class="j">“Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,1);</script>It happened soon
afterwards, that he went about through cities and villages, preaching and
bringing the good news of the Kingdom of God. With him were the twelve,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,2);</script>and certain women who had
been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary who was called
Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,3);</script>and Joanna, the wife of Chuzas,
Herod’s steward; Susanna; and many others; who served <a
href="#N18">them</a> from their possessions. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,4);</script>When a great multitude came
together, and people from every city were coming to him, he spoke by a
parable. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,5);</script><span
class="j">“The farmer went out to sow his seed. As he sowed, some fell
along the road, and it was trampled under foot, and the birds of the sky
devoured it. <script type="text/javascript">cj(8,6);</script>Other seed
fell on the rock, and as soon as it grew, it withered away, because it had
no moisture. <script type="text/javascript">cj(8,7);</script>Other fell
amid the thorns, and the thorns grew with it, and choked it. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,8);</script>Other fell into the good ground,
and grew, and brought forth fruit one hundred times.”</span> As he said
these things, he called out, <span class="j">“He who has ears to hear,
let him hear!”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,9);</script>Then his disciples
asked him, “What does this parable mean?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,10);</script>He said, <span
class="j">“To you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of
God, but to the rest in parables; that ‘seeing they may not see, and
hearing they may not understand.’<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N19">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,11);</script>Now the parable is this: The seed
is the word of God. <script type="text/javascript">cj(8,12);</script>Those
along the road are those who hear, then the devil comes, and takes away
the word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,13);</script>Those on the rock are they who,
when they hear, receive the word with joy; but these have no root, who
believe for a while, then fall away in time of temptation. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,14);</script>That which fell among the thorns,
these are those who have heard, and as they go on their way they are
choked with cares, riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to
maturity. <script type="text/javascript">cj(8,15);</script>That in the
good ground, these are such as in an honest and good heart, having heard
the word, hold it tightly, and bring forth fruit with patience.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,16);</script>“No one, when he has lit a
lamp, covers it with a container, or puts it under a bed; but puts it on a
stand, that those who enter in may see the light. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,17);</script>For nothing is hidden, that will
not be revealed; nor anything secret, that will not be known and come to
light. <script type="text/javascript">cj(8,18);</script>Be careful
therefore how you hear. For whoever has, to him will be given; and whoever
doesn’t have, from him will be taken away even that which he thinks he
has.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,19);</script>His mother and
brothers came to him, and they could not come near him for the crowd.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,20);</script>It was told him by some
saying, “Your mother and your brothers stand outside, desiring to see
you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,21);</script>But he answered them,
<span class="j">“My mother and my brothers are these who hear the word
of God, and do it.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,22);</script>Now it happened on one
of those days, that he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples, and
he said to them, <span class="j">“Let’s go over to the other side of
the lake.”</span> So they launched out. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,23);</script>But as they sailed, he fell
asleep. A wind storm came down on the lake, and they were taking on
dangerous amounts of water. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,24);</script>They came to him, and awoke him,
saying, “Master, master, we are dying!” He awoke, and rebuked the wind
and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and it was calm.<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N20">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,25);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Where is your faith?”</span> Being afraid they marveled,
saying one to another, “Who is this, then, that he commands even the
winds and the water, and they obey him?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,26);</script>They arrived at the country of
the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,27);</script>When Jesus stepped
ashore, a certain man out of the city who had demons for a long time met
him. He wore no clothes, and didn’t live in a house, but in the tombs.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,28);</script>When he saw Jesus, he
cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, “What
do I have to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I beg you,
don’t torment me!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,29);</script>For Jesus was commanding the
unclean spirit to come out of the man. For the unclean spirit had often
seized the man. He was kept under guard, and bound with chains and
fetters. Breaking the bands apart, he was driven by the demon into the
desert.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,30);</script>Jesus asked him, <span
class="j">“What is your name?”</span>
<p>He said, “Legion,” for many demons had entered into him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,31);</script>They begged him that he would not
command them to go into the abyss. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,32);</script>Now there was there a herd of
many pigs feeding on the mountain, and they begged him that he would allow
them to enter into those. He allowed them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,33);</script>The demons came out from the man,
and entered into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into
the lake, and were drowned. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,34);</script>When those who fed them saw what
had happened, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,35);</script>People went out to see
what had happened. They came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the
demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus’ feet, clothed and in his right
mind; and they were afraid. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,36);</script>Those who saw it told them how he
who had been possessed by demons was healed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,37);</script>All the people of the surrounding
country of the Gadarenes asked him to depart from them, for they were very
much afraid. He entered into the boat, and returned. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,38);</script>But the man from whom the demons
had gone out begged him that he might go with him, but Jesus sent him
away, saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,39);</script><span
class="j">“Return to your house, and declare what great things God has
done for you.”</span> He went his way, proclaiming throughout the whole
city what great things Jesus had done for him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,40);</script>It happened, when
Jesus returned, that the multitude welcomed him, for they were all waiting
for him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,41);</script>Behold, there
came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue. He fell down
at Jesus’ feet, and begged him to come into his house, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,42);</script>for he had an only daughter,
about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as he went, the
multitudes pressed against him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,43);</script>A woman who had a flow of blood
for twelve years, who had spent all her living on physicians, and could
not be healed by any, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,44);</script>came behind him, and touched the
<a href="#N21">fringe</a> of his cloak, and immediately the flow of her
blood stopped. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,45);</script>Jesus
said, <span class="j">“Who touched me?”</span>
<p>When all denied it, Peter and those with him said, “Master, the
multitudes press and jostle you, and you say, <span class="j">‘Who
touched me?’</span>”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,46);</script>But Jesus said, <span
class="j">“Someone did touch me, for I perceived that power has gone out
of me.”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,47);</script>When the
woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down
before him declared to him in the presence of all the people the reason
why she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,48);</script>He said to her, <span
class="j">“Daughter, cheer up. Your faith has made you well. Go in
peace.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,49);</script>While he still spoke,
one from the ruler of the synagogue’s house came, saying to him, “Your
daughter is dead. Don’t trouble the Teacher.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,50);</script>But Jesus hearing it,
answered him, <span class="j">“Don’t be afraid. Only believe, and she
will be healed.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,51);</script>When he came to the
house, he didn’t allow anyone to enter in, except Peter, John, James,
the father of the child, and her mother. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,52);</script>All were weeping and mourning
her, but he said, <span class="j">“Don’t weep. She isn’t dead, but
sleeping.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,53);</script>They were ridiculing
him, knowing that she was dead. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,54);</script>But he put them all outside, and
taking her by the hand, he called, saying, <span class="j">“Child,
arise!”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,55);</script>Her
spirit returned, and she rose up immediately. He commanded that something
be given to her to eat. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,56);</script>Her parents were amazed, but he
commanded them to tell no one what had been done.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,1);</script>He called <a
href="#N22">the twelve</a> together, and gave them power and authority
over all demons, and to cure diseases. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,2);</script>He sent them forth to preach the
Kingdom of God, and to heal the sick. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,3);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Take nothing for your journey—neither staffs, nor wallet,
nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats apiece. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(9,4);</script>Into whatever house you enter,
stay there, and depart from there. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(9,5);</script>As many as don’t receive you,
when you depart from that city, shake off even the dust from your feet for
a testimony against them.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,6);</script>They departed, and went
throughout the villages, preaching the Good News, and healing everywhere.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,7);</script>Now Herod the tetrarch
heard of all that was done by him; and he was very perplexed, because it
was said by some that John had risen from the dead, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,8);</script>and by some that Elijah had
appeared, and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,9);</script>Herod said, “John I
beheaded, but who is this, about whom I hear such things?” He sought to
see him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,10);</script>The apostles,
when they had returned, told him what things they had done.
<p>He took them, and withdrew apart to a deserted place of a city called
Bethsaida. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,11);</script>But the
multitudes, perceiving it, followed him. He welcomed them, and spoke to
them of the Kingdom of God, and he cured those who needed healing. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,12);</script>The day began to wear away; and
the twelve came, and said to him, “Send the multitude away, that they
may go into the surrounding villages and farms, and lodge, and get food,
for we are here in a deserted place.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,13);</script>But he said to them,
<span class="j">“You give them something to eat.”</span>
<p>They said, “We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we
should go and buy food for all these people.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,14);</script>For they were about five thousand
men.
<p>He said to his disciples, <span class="j">“Make them sit down in
groups of about fifty each.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,15);</script>They did so, and made them all
sit down. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,16);</script>He took the
five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to the sky, he blessed them,
and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the
multitude. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,17);</script>They ate, and
were all filled. They gathered up twelve baskets of broken pieces that
were left over.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,18);</script>It happened, as he was
praying alone, that the disciples were with him, and he asked them, <span
class="j">“Who do the multitudes say that I am?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,19);</script>They answered,
“‘John the Baptizer,’ but others say, ‘Elijah,’ and others, that
one of the old prophets is risen again.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,20);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“But who do you say that I am?”</span>
<p>Peter answered, “The Christ of God.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,21);</script>But he warned them,
and commanded them to tell this to no one, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,22);</script>saying, <span class="j">“The
Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, chief
priests, and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised
up.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,23);</script>He said to all, <span
class="j">“If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself,
take up his cross,<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N23">*</a></sup></font> and follow me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(9,24);</script>For whoever desires to save his
life will lose it, but whoever will lose his life for my sake, the same
will save it. <script type="text/javascript">cj(9,25);</script>For what
does it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses or forfeits
his own self? <script type="text/javascript">cj(9,26);</script>For whoever
will be ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be
ashamed, when he comes in his glory, and the glory of the Father, and of
the holy angels. <script type="text/javascript">cj(9,27);</script>But I
tell you the truth: There are some of those who stand here, who will in no
way taste of death, until they see the Kingdom of God.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,28);</script>It happened about
eight days after these sayings, that he took with him Peter, John, and
James, and went up onto the mountain to pray. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,29);</script>As he was praying, the appearance
of his face was altered, and his clothing became white and dazzling.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,30);</script>Behold, two men were
talking with him, who were Moses and Elijah, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,31);</script>who appeared in glory, and spoke
of his <a href="#N24">departure,</a> which he was about to accomplish at
Jerusalem.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,32);</script>Now Peter and those
who were with him were heavy with sleep, but when they were fully awake,
they saw his glory, and the two men who stood with him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,33);</script>It happened, as they were parting
from him, that Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be
here. Let’s make three tents: one for you, and one for Moses, and one
for Elijah,” not knowing what he said.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,34);</script>While he said these
things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they
entered into the cloud. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,35);</script>A
voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my beloved Son. Listen to
him!” <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,36);</script>When the voice
came, Jesus was found alone. They were silent, and told no one in those
days any of the things which they had seen.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,37);</script>It happened on the
next day, when they had come down from the mountain, that a great
multitude met him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,38);</script>Behold, a man from the crowd
called out, saying, “Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my
only child. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,39);</script>Behold, a
spirit takes him, he suddenly cries out, and it convulses him so that he
foams, and it hardly departs from him, bruising him severely. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,40);</script>I begged your disciples to cast
it out, and they couldn’t.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,41);</script>Jesus answered, <span
class="j">“Faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with
you and bear with you? Bring your son here.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,42);</script>While he was still
coming, the demon threw him down and convulsed him violently. But Jesus
rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his
father. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,43);</script>They were all
astonished at the majesty of God.
<p>But while all were marveling at all the things which Jesus did, he said
to his disciples, <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,44);</script><span
class="j">“Let these words sink into your ears, for the Son of Man will
be delivered up into the hands of men.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,45);</script>But they didn’t understand this
saying. It was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it, and
they were afraid to ask him about this saying.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,46);</script>There arose an
argument among them about which of them was the greatest. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,47);</script>Jesus, perceiving the reasoning
of their hearts, took a little child, and set him by his side, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,48);</script>and said to them, <span
class="j">“Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me.
Whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For whoever is least among
you all, this one will be great.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,49);</script>John answered,
“Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we forbade
him, because he doesn’t follow with us.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,50);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“Don’t forbid him, for he who is not against us is for
us.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,51);</script>It came to pass, when
the days were near that he should be taken up, he intently set his face to
go to Jerusalem, <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,52);</script>and sent
messengers before his face. They went, and entered into a village of the
Samaritans, so as to prepare for him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,53);</script>They didn’t receive him,
because he was traveling with his face set towards Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,54);</script>When his disciples, James and
John, saw this, they said, “Lord, do you want us to command fire to come
down from the sky, and destroy them, just as Elijah did?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,55);</script>But he turned and
rebuked them, <span class="j">“You don’t know of what kind of spirit
you are. <script type="text/javascript">cj(9,56);</script>For the Son of
Man didn’t come to destroy men’s lives, but to save them.”</span>
<p>They went to another village. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,57);</script>As they went on the way, a
certain man said to him, “I want to follow you wherever you go, Lord.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,58);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have
nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,59);</script>He said to another,
<span class="j">“Follow me!”</span>
<p>But he said, “Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,60);</script>But Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“Leave the dead to bury their own dead, but you go and
announce the Kingdom of God.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,61);</script>Another also said,
“I want to follow you, Lord, but first allow me to say good-bye to those
who are at my house.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,62);</script>But Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“No one, having put his hand to the plow, and looking
back, is fit for the Kingdom of God.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,1);</script>Now after these
things, the Lord also appointed seventy others, and sent them two by two
<a href="#N25">ahead of him</a> into every city and place, where he was
about to come. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,2);</script>Then he
said to them, <span class="j">“The harvest is indeed plentiful, but the
laborers are few. Pray therefore to the Lord of the harvest, that he may
send out laborers into his harvest. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,3);</script>Go your ways. Behold, I send you
out as lambs among wolves. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,4);</script>Carry no purse, nor wallet, nor
sandals. Greet no one on the way. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,5);</script>Into whatever house you enter,
first say, ‘Peace be to this house.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,6);</script>If a son of peace is there, your
peace will rest on him; but if not, it will return to you. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,7);</script>Remain in that same house, eating
and drinking the things they give, for the laborer is worthy of his wages.
Don’t go from house to house. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,8);</script>Into whatever city you enter, and
they receive you, eat the things that are set before you. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,9);</script>Heal the sick who are therein,
and tell them, ‘The Kingdom of God has come near to you.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,10);</script>But into whatever city you
enter, and they don’t receive you, go out into its streets and say,
<script type="text/javascript">cj(10,11);</script>‘Even the dust from
your city that clings to us, we wipe off against you. Nevertheless know
this, that the Kingdom of God has come near to you.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,12);</script>I tell you, it will be more
tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that city.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,13);</script>“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to
you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon
which were done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in
sackcloth and ashes. <script type="text/javascript">cj(10,14);</script>But
it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(10,15);</script>You, Capernaum, who are
exalted to heaven, will be brought down to <a href="#N26">Hades.</a>
<script type="text/javascript">cj(10,16);</script>Whoever listens to you
listens to me, and whoever rejects you rejects me. Whoever rejects me
rejects him who sent me.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,17);</script>The seventy returned
with joy, saying, “Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your
name!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,18);</script>He said to them,
<span class="j">“I saw Satan having fallen like lightning from heaven.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(10,19);</script>Behold, I give you
authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of
the enemy. Nothing will in any way hurt you. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,20);</script>Nevertheless, don’t rejoice in
this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are
written in heaven.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,21);</script>In that same hour
Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and said, <span class="j">“I thank
you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things
from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to little children.
Yes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,22);</script>Turning to the
disciples, he said, <span class="j">“All things have been delivered to
me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is, except the Father, and who
the Father is, except the Son, and he to whomever the Son desires to
reveal him.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,23);</script>Turning to the
disciples, he said privately, <span class="j">“Blessed are the eyes
which see the things that you see, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,24);</script>for I tell you that many
prophets and kings desired to see the things which you see, and didn’t
see them, and to hear the things which you hear, and didn’t hear
them.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,25);</script>Behold, a certain
lawyer stood up and tested him, saying, “Teacher, what shall I do to
inherit eternal life?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,26);</script>He said to him, <span
class="j">“What is written in the law? How do you read it?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,27);</script>He answered, “You
shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with
all your strength, and with all your mind;<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N27">*</a></sup></font> and your neighbor as
yourself.”<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N28">*</a></sup></font>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,28);</script>He said to him, <span
class="j">“You have answered correctly. Do this, and you will
live.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,29);</script>But he, desiring to
justify himself, asked Jesus, “Who is my neighbor?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,30);</script>Jesus answered, <span
class="j">“A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and
he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed,
leaving him half dead. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,31);</script>By chance a certain priest was
going down that way. When he saw him, he passed by on the other side.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(10,32);</script>In the same way a Levite
also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(10,33);</script>But a certain Samaritan,
as he traveled, came where he was. When he saw him, he was moved with
compassion, <script type="text/javascript">cj(10,34);</script>came to him,
and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. He set him on his own
animal, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,35);</script>On the next day, when he
departed, he took out two denarii, and gave them to the host, and said to
him, ‘Take care of him. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will repay you
when I return.’ <script type="text/javascript">cj(10,36);</script>Now
which of these three do you think seemed to be a neighbor to him who fell
among the robbers?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,37);</script>He said, “He who
showed mercy on him.”
<p>Then Jesus said to him, <span class="j">“Go and do likewise.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,38);</script>It happened as they
went on their way, he entered into a certain village, and a certain woman
named Martha received him into her house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,39);</script>She had a sister called Mary,
who also sat at Jesus’ feet, and heard his word. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,40);</script>But Martha was distracted with
much serving, and she came up to him, and said, “Lord, don’t you care
that my sister left me to serve alone? Ask her therefore to help me.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,41);</script>Jesus answered her,
<span class="j">“Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many
things, <script type="text/javascript">cj(10,42);</script>but one thing is
needed. Mary has chosen the good part, which will not be taken away from
her.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,1);</script>It happened, that when
he finished praying in a certain place, one of his disciples said to him,
“Lord, teach us to pray, just as John also taught his disciples.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,2);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“When you pray, say,</span>
<dl><span class="j">
<dt>‘Our Father in heaven,
<dd>may your name be kept holy.
<dt>May your Kingdom come.
<dd>May your will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cj(11,3);</script>Give us day by day
our daily bread.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cj(11,4);</script>Forgive us our sins,
<dd>for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us.
<dt>Bring us not into temptation,
<dd>but deliver us from the evil one.’”</span>
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,5);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Which of you, if you go to a friend at midnight, and tell
him, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves of bread, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,6);</script>for a friend of mine has come to
me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him,’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,7);</script>and he from within will answer
and say, ‘Don’t bother me. The door is now shut, and my children are
with me in bed. I can’t get up and give it to you’? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,8);</script>I tell you, although he will not
rise and give it to him because he is his friend, yet because of his
persistence, he will get up and give him as many as he needs.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,9);</script>“I tell you, keep asking, and
it will be given you. Keep seeking, and you will find. Keep knocking, and
it will be opened to you. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,10);</script>For everyone who asks receives.
He who seeks finds. To him who knocks it will be opened.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,11);</script>“Which of you fathers, if your
son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, he
won’t give him a snake instead of a fish, will he? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,12);</script>Or if he asks for an egg, he
won’t give him a scorpion, will he? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,13);</script>If you then, being evil, know
how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly
Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,14);</script>He was casting out a
demon, and it was mute. It happened, when the demon had gone out, the mute
man spoke; and the multitudes marveled. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,15);</script>But some of them said, “He
casts out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,16);</script>Others, testing him, sought from
him a sign from heaven. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,17);</script>But he, knowing their thoughts,
said to them, <span class="j">“Every kingdom divided against itself is
brought to desolation. A house divided against itself falls. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,18);</script>If Satan also is divided against
himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by
Beelzebul. <script type="text/javascript">cj(11,19);</script>But if I cast
out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore
will they be your judges. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,20);</script>But if I by the finger of God
cast out demons, then the Kingdom of God has come to you.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,21);</script>“When the strong man, fully
armed, guards his own dwelling, his goods are safe. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,22);</script>But when someone stronger
attacks him and overcomes him, he takes from him his whole armor in which
he trusted, and divides his spoils.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,23);</script>“He that is not with me is
against me. He who doesn’t gather with me scatters. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,24);</script>The unclean spirit, when he has
gone out of the man, passes through dry places, seeking rest, and finding
none, he says, ‘I will turn back to my house from which I came out.’
<script type="text/javascript">cj(11,25);</script>When he returns, he
finds it swept and put in order. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,26);</script>Then he goes, and takes seven
other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter in and dwell there.
The last state of that man becomes worse than the first.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,27);</script>It came to pass, as
he said these things, a certain woman out of the multitude lifted up her
voice, and said to him, “Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the
breasts which nursed you!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,28);</script>But he said, <span
class="j">“On the contrary, blessed are those who hear the word of God,
and keep it.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,29);</script>When the multitudes
were gathering together to him, he began to say, <span class="j">“This
is an evil generation. It seeks after a sign. No sign will be given to it
but the sign of Jonah, the prophet. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,30);</script>For even as Jonah became a sign
to the Ninevites, so will also the Son of Man be to this generation.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(11,31);</script>The Queen of the South
will rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and will
condemn them: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom
of Solomon; and behold, one greater than Solomon is here. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,32);</script>The men of Nineveh will stand up
in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it: for they
repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, one greater than Jonah is
here.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,33);</script>“No one, when he has lit a
lamp, puts it in a cellar or under a basket, but on a stand, that those
who come in may see the light. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,34);</script>The lamp of the body is the eye.
Therefore when your eye is good, your whole body is also full of light;
but when it is evil, your body also is full of darkness. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,35);</script>Therefore see whether the light
that is in you isn’t darkness. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,36);</script>If therefore your whole body is
full of light, having no part dark, it will be wholly full of light, as
when the lamp with its bright shining gives you light.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,37);</script>Now as he spoke, a
certain Pharisee asked him to dine with him. He went in, and sat at the
table. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,38);</script>When the Pharisee
saw it, he marveled that he had not first washed himself before dinner.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,39);</script>The Lord said to him,
<span class="j">“Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of
the platter, but your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(11,40);</script>You foolish ones,
didn’t he who made the outside make the inside also? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,41);</script>But give for gifts to the needy
those things which are within, and behold, all things will be clean to
you. <script type="text/javascript">cj(11,42);</script>But woe to you
Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and every herb, but you bypass
justice and the love of God. You ought to have done these, and not to have
left the other undone. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,43);</script>Woe to you Pharisees! For you
love the best seats in the synagogues, and the greetings in the
marketplaces. <script type="text/javascript">cj(11,44);</script>Woe to
you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like hidden graves,
and the men who walk over them don’t know it.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,45);</script>One of the lawyers
answered him, “Teacher, in saying this you insult us also.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,46);</script>He said, <span
class="j">“Woe to you lawyers also! For you load men with burdens that
are difficult to carry, and you yourselves won’t even lift one finger to
help carry those burdens. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,47);</script>Woe to you! For you build the
tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,48);</script>So you testify and consent to
the works of your fathers. For they killed them, and you build their
tombs. <script type="text/javascript">cj(11,49);</script>Therefore also
the wisdom of God said, ‘I will send to them prophets and apostles; and
some of them they will kill and persecute, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,50);</script>that the blood of all the
prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required
of this generation; <script type="text/javascript">cj(11,51);</script>from
the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah, who perished between the
altar and the sanctuary.’ Yes, I tell you, it will be required of this
generation. <script type="text/javascript">cj(11,52);</script>Woe to you
lawyers! For you took away the key of knowledge. You didn’t enter in
yourselves, and those who were entering in, you hindered.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,53);</script>As he said these
things to them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be terribly angry,
and to draw many things out of him; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,54);</script>lying in wait for him, and
seeking to catch him in something he might say, that they might accuse him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,1);</script>Meanwhile, when a
multitude of many thousands had gathered together, so much so that they
trampled on each other, he began to tell his disciples first of all, <span
class="j">“Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(12,2);</script>But there is nothing
covered up, that will not be revealed, nor hidden, that will not be known.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(12,3);</script>Therefore whatever you

you in that same hour what you must say.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,13);</script>One of the multitude
said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with
me.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,14);</script>But he said to him,
<span class="j">“Man, who made me a judge or an arbitrator over
you?”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,15);</script>He said
to them, <span class="j">“Beware! Keep yourselves from covetousness, for
a man’s life doesn’t consist of the abundance of the things which he
possesses.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,16);</script>He spoke a parable to
them, saying, <span class="j">“The ground of a certain rich man brought
forth abundantly. <script type="text/javascript">cj(12,17);</script>He
reasoned within himself, saying, ‘What will I do, because I don’t have
room to store my crops?’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,18);</script>He said, ‘This is what I will
do. I will pull down my barns, and build bigger ones, and there I will
store all my grain and my goods. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,19);</script>I will tell my soul, “Soul,
you have many goods laid up for many years. Take your ease, eat, drink, be
merry.”’
</span><p><span class="j"><script

foolish one, tonight your soul is required of you. The things which you
have prepared—whose will they be?’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,21);</script>So is he who lays up treasure
for himself, and is not rich toward God.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,22);</script>He said to his
disciples, <span class="j">“Therefore I tell you, don’t be anxious for
your life, what you will eat, nor yet for your body, what you will wear.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(12,23);</script>Life is more than food,
and the body is more than clothing. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,24);</script>Consider the ravens: they
don’t sow, they don’t reap, they have no warehouse or barn, and God
feeds them. How much more valuable are you than birds! <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,25);</script>Which of you by being anxious
can add a cubit to his height? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,26);</script>If then you aren’t able to do
even the least things, why are you anxious about the rest? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,27);</script>Consider the lilies, how they
grow. They don’t toil, neither do they spin; yet I tell you, even
Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,28);</script>But if this is how God clothes
the grass in the field, which today exists, and tomorrow is cast into the
oven, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,29);</script>Don’t seek what you will eat
or what you will drink; neither be anxious. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,30);</script>For the nations of the world
seek after all of these things, but your Father knows that you need these
things. <script type="text/javascript">cj(12,31);</script>But seek God’s
Kingdom, and all these things will be added to you. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,32);</script>Don’t be afraid, little flock,
for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the Kingdom. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,33);</script>Sell that which you have, and
give gifts to the needy. Make for yourselves purses which don’t grow
old, a treasure in the heavens that doesn’t fail, where no thief
approaches, neither moth destroys. <script

there will your heart be also.
</span><p><span class="j"><script

your lamps burning. <script type="text/javascript">cj(12,36);</script>Be
like men watching for their lord, when he returns from the marriage feast;
that, when he comes and knocks, they may immediately open to him. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,37);</script>Blessed are those servants, whom
the lord will find watching when he comes. Most certainly I tell you, that
he will dress himself, and make them recline, and will come and serve
them. <script type="text/javascript">cj(12,38);</script>They will be
blessed if he comes in the second or third watch, and finds them so.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(12,39);</script>But know this, that if
the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming, he
would have watched, and not allowed his house to be broken into. <script

Son of Man is coming in an hour that you don’t expect him.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,41);</script>Peter said to him,
“Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to everybody?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,42);</script>The Lord said, <span

set over his household, to give them their portion of food at the right

servant whom his lord will find doing so when he comes. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,44);</script>Truly I tell you, that he will
set him over all that he has. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,45);</script>But if that servant says in his
heart, ‘My lord delays his coming,’ and begins to beat the menservants
and the maidservants, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,46);</script>then the lord of that servant
will come in a day when he isn’t expecting him, and in an hour that he
doesn’t know, and will cut him in two, and place his portion with the
unfaithful. <script type="text/javascript">cj(12,47);</script>That
servant, who knew his lord’s will, and didn’t prepare, nor do what he
wanted, will be beaten with many stripes, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,48);</script>but he who didn’t know, and
did things worthy of stripes, will be beaten with few stripes. To whomever
much is given, of him will much be required; and to whom much was
entrusted, of him more will be asked.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,49);</script>“I came to throw fire on the

baptized with, and how distressed I am until it is accomplished! <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,51);</script>Do you think that I have come to
give peace in the earth? I tell you, no, but rather division. <script

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,54);</script>He said to the
multitudes also, <span class="j">“When you see a cloud rising from the
west, immediately you say, ‘A shower is coming,’ and so it happens.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(12,55);</script>When a south wind blows,
you say, ‘There will be a scorching heat,’ and it happens. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,56);</script>You hypocrites! You know how to
interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky, but how is it that you
don’t interpret this time? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,57);</script>Why don’t you judge for
yourselves what is right? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,58);</script>For when you are going with your
adversary before the magistrate, try diligently on the way to be released
from him, lest perhaps he drag you to the judge, and the judge deliver you
to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,59);</script>I tell you, you will by no means
get out of there, until you have paid the very last <a

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,1);</script>Now there were some
present at the same time who told him about the Galileans, whose blood
Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,2);</script>Jesus answered them, <span
class="j">“Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all
the other Galileans, because they suffered such things? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,3);</script>I tell you, no, but unless you
repent, you will all perish in the same way. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,4);</script>Or those eighteen, on whom the
tower in Siloam fell, and killed them; do you think that they were worse
offenders than all the men who dwell in Jerusalem? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,5);</script>I tell you, no, but, unless you
repent, you will all perish in the same way.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,6);</script>He spoke this parable.
<span class="j">“A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard,
and he came seeking fruit on it, and found none. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,7);</script>He said to the vine dresser,
‘Behold, these three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig
tree, and found none. Cut it down. Why does it waste the soil?’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,8);</script>He answered, ‘Lord, leave it
alone this year also, until I dig around it, and fertilize it. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,9);</script>If it bears fruit, fine; but if
not, after that, you can cut it down.’”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,10);</script>He was teaching in
one of the synagogues on the Sabbath day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,11);</script>Behold, there was a woman who
had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and she was bent over, and could
in no way straighten herself up. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,12);</script>When Jesus saw her, he called
her, and said to her, <span class="j">“Woman, you are freed from your
infirmity.”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,13);</script>He
laid his hands on her, and immediately she stood up straight, and
glorified God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,14);</script>The ruler of the
synagogue, being indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, said
to the multitude, “There are six days in which men ought to work.
Therefore come on those days and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,15);</script>Therefore the Lord
answered him, <span class="j">“You hypocrites! Doesn’t each one of you
free his ox or his donkey from the stall on the Sabbath, and lead him away
to water? <script type="text/javascript">cj(13,16);</script>Ought not this
woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan had bound eighteen long
years, be freed from this bondage on the Sabbath day?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,17);</script>As he said these
things, all his adversaries were disappointed, and all the multitude
rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,18);</script>He said, <span
class="j">“What is the Kingdom of God like? To what shall I compare it?
<script type="text/javascript">cj(13,19);</script>It is like a grain of
mustard seed, which a man took, and put in his own garden. It grew, and
became a large tree, and the birds of the sky lodged in its branches.”
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,20);</script>Again he said, “To what shall
I compare the Kingdom of God? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,21);</script>It is like yeast, which a woman
took and hid in <a href="#N33">three measures</a> of flour, until it was
all leavened.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,22);</script>He went on his way
through cities and villages, teaching, and traveling on to Jerusalem.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,23);</script>One said to him,
“Lord, are they few who are saved?”
<p>He said to them, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,24);</script><span class="j">“Strive to
enter in by the narrow door, for many, I tell you, will seek to enter in,
and will not be able. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,25);</script>When once the master of the
house has risen up, and has shut the door, and you begin to stand outside,
and to knock at the door, saying, ‘Lord, Lord, open to us!’ then he
will answer and tell you, ‘I don’t know you or where you come from.’
<script type="text/javascript">cj(13,26);</script>Then you will begin to
say, ‘We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our
streets.’ <script type="text/javascript">cj(13,27);</script>He will say,
‘I tell you, I don’t know where you come from. Depart from me, all you
workers of iniquity.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,28);</script>There will be weeping and
gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the
prophets, in the Kingdom of God, and yourselves being thrown outside.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(13,29);</script>They will come from the
east, west, north, and south, and will sit down in the Kingdom of God.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(13,30);</script>Behold, there are some
who are last who will be first, and there are some who are first who will
be last.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,31);</script>On that same day,
some Pharisees came, saying to him, “Get out of here, and go away, for
Herod wants to kill you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,32);</script>He said to them,
<span class="j">“Go and tell that fox, ‘Behold, I cast out demons and
perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I complete my mission.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(13,33);</script>Nevertheless I must go
on my way today and tomorrow and the next day, for it can’t be that a
prophet perish outside of Jerusalem.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,34);</script>“Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that
kills the prophets, and stones those who are sent to her! How often I
wanted to gather your children together, like a hen gathers her own brood
under her wings, and you refused! <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,35);</script>Behold, your house is left to
you desolate. I tell you, you will not see me, until you say, ‘Blessed

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,1);</script>It happened, when he
went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a Sabbath to
eat bread, that they were watching him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,2);</script>Behold, a certain man who had
dropsy was in front of him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,3);</script>Jesus, answering, spoke to the
lawyers and Pharisees, saying, <span class="j">“Is it lawful to heal on
the Sabbath?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,4);</script>But they were silent.
<p>He took him, and healed him, and let him go. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,5);</script>He answered them, <span
class="j">“Which of you, if your <a href="#N35">son</a> or an ox fell
into a well, wouldn’t immediately pull him out on a Sabbath
day?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,6);</script>They couldn’t answer
him regarding these things.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,7);</script>He spoke a parable to
those who were invited, when he noticed how they chose the best seats, and
said to them, <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,8);</script><span
class="j">“When you are invited by anyone to a marriage feast, don’t
sit in the best seat, since perhaps someone more honorable than you might
be invited by him, <script type="text/javascript">cj(14,9);</script>and he
who invited both of you would come and tell you, ‘Make room for this
person.’ Then you would begin, with shame, to take the lowest place.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(14,10);</script>But when you are
invited, go and sit in the lowest place, so that when he who invited you
comes, he may tell you, ‘Friend, move up higher.’ Then you will be
honored in the presence of all who sit at the table with you. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,11);</script>For everyone who exalts himself
will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,12);</script>He also said to the
one who had invited him, <span class="j">“When you make a dinner or a
supper, don’t call your friends, nor your brothers, nor your kinsmen,
nor rich neighbors, or perhaps they might also return the favor, and pay
you back. <script type="text/javascript">cj(14,13);</script>But when you
make a feast, ask the poor, the maimed, the lame, or the blind; <script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,14);</script>and you will be blessed, because
they don’t have the resources to repay you. For you will be repaid in
the resurrection of the righteous.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,15);</script>When one of those who
sat at the table with him heard these things, he said to him, “Blessed
is he who will feast in the Kingdom of God!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,16);</script>But he said to him,
<span class="j">“A certain man made a great supper, and he invited many
people. <script type="text/javascript">cj(14,17);</script>He sent out his
servant at supper time to tell those who were invited, ‘Come, for
everything is ready now.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,18);</script>They all as one began to make
excuses.
</span><p><span class="j">“The first said to him, ‘I have bought a
field, and I must go and see it. Please have me excused.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,19);</script>“Another said, ‘I have
bought five yoke of oxen, and I must go try them out. Please have me
excused.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,20);</script>“Another said, ‘I have
married a wife, and therefore I can’t come.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,21);</script>“That servant came, and told
his lord these things. Then the master of the house, being angry, said to
his servant, ‘Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and
bring in the poor, maimed, blind, and lame.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,22);</script>“The servant said, ‘Lord, it
is done as you commanded, and there is still room.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,23);</script>“The lord said to the servant,
‘Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that
my house may be filled. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,24);</script>For I tell you that none of
those men who were invited will taste of my supper.’”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,25);</script>Now great multitudes
were going with him. He turned and said to them, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,26);</script><span class="j">“If anyone
comes to me, and doesn’t <a href="#N36">disregard</a> his own father,
mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters, yes, and his own life also,
he can’t be my disciple. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,27);</script>Whoever doesn’t bear his own
cross, and come after me, can’t be my disciple. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,28);</script>For which of you, desiring to
build a tower, doesn’t first sit down and count the cost, to see if he
has enough to complete it? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,29);</script>Or perhaps, when he has laid a
foundation, and is not able to finish, everyone who sees begins to mock
him, <script type="text/javascript">cj(14,30);</script>saying, ‘This man
began to build, and wasn’t able to finish.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,31);</script>Or what king, as he goes to
encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and consider
whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him
with twenty thousand? <script type="text/javascript">cj(14,32);</script>Or
else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends an envoy, and asks
for conditions of peace. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,33);</script>So therefore whoever of you who
doesn’t renounce all that he has, he can’t be my disciple. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,34);</script>Salt is good, but if the salt
becomes flat and tasteless, with what do you season it? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,35);</script>It is fit neither for the soil
nor for the manure pile. It is thrown out. He who has ears to hear, let
him hear.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,1);</script>Now all the tax
collectors and sinners were coming close to him to hear him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,2);</script>The Pharisees and the scribes
murmured, saying, “This man welcomes sinners, and eats with them.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,3);</script>He told them this
parable. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,4);</script><span
class="j">“Which of you men, if you had one hundred sheep, and lost one
of them, wouldn’t leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after
the one that was lost, until he found it? <script

it on his shoulders, rejoicing. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,6);</script>When he comes home, he calls
together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, ‘Rejoice with
me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,7);</script>I tell you that even so there
will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, than over
ninety-nine righteous people who need no repentance. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,8);</script>Or what woman, if she had ten <a

light a lamp, sweep the house, and seek diligently until she found it?
<script type="text/javascript">cj(15,9);</script>When she has found it,
she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, ‘Rejoice with me,
for I have found the drachma which I had lost.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,10);</script>Even so, I tell you, there is
joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner
repenting.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,11);</script>He said, <span
class="j">“A certain man had two sons. <script

father, ‘Father, give me my share of your property.’ He divided his
livelihood between them. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,13);</script>Not many days after, the younger
son gathered all of this together and traveled into a far country. There
he wasted his property with riotous living. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,14);</script>When he had spent all of it,
there arose a severe famine in that country, and he began to be in need.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(15,15);</script>He went and joined
himself to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his
fields to feed pigs. <script type="text/javascript">cj(15,16);</script>He
wanted to fill his belly with the husks that the pigs ate, but no one gave
him any. <script type="text/javascript">cj(15,17);</script>But when he
came to himself he said, ‘How many hired servants of my father’s have
bread enough to spare, and I’m dying with hunger! <script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,18);</script>I will get up and go to my
father, and will tell him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in
your sight. <script type="text/javascript">cj(15,19);</script>I am no more
worthy to be called your son. Make me as one of your hired servants.”’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,20);</script>“He arose, and came to his
father. But while he was still far off, his father saw him, and was moved
with compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,21);</script>The son said to him, ‘Father,
I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight. I am no longer worthy to
be called your son.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,22);</script>“But the father said to his
servants, ‘Bring out the best robe, and put it on him. Put a ring on his
hand, and shoes on his feet. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,23);</script>Bring the fattened calf, kill
it, and let us eat, and celebrate; <script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,24);</script>for this, my son, was dead, and
is alive again. He was lost, and is found.’ They began to celebrate.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,25);</script>“Now his elder son was in the
field. As he came near to the house, he heard music and dancing. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,26);</script>He called one of the servants to
him, and asked what was going on. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,27);</script>He said to him, ‘Your brother
has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has
received him back safe and healthy.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,28);</script>But he was angry, and would not
go in. Therefore his father came out, and begged him. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,29);</script>But he answered his father,
‘Behold, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed a
commandment of yours, but you never gave me a goat, that I might celebrate
with my friends. <script type="text/javascript">cj(15,30);</script>But
when this, your son, came, who has devoured your living with prostitutes,
you killed the fattened calf for him.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,31);</script>“He said to him, ‘Son, you
are always with me, and all that is mine is yours. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,32);</script>But it was appropriate to
celebrate and be glad, for this, your brother, was dead, and is alive
again. He was lost, and is found.’”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,1);</script>He also said to his
disciples, <span class="j">“There was a certain rich man who had a
manager. An accusation was made to him that this man was wasting his
possessions. <script type="text/javascript">cj(16,2);</script>He called
him, and said to him, ‘What is this that I hear about you? Give an
accounting of your management, for you can no longer be manager.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,3);</script>“The manager said within
himself, ‘What will I do, seeing that my lord is taking away the
management position from me? I don’t have strength to dig. I am ashamed
to beg. <script type="text/javascript">cj(16,4);</script>I know what I
will do, so that when I am removed from management, they may receive me
into their houses.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,5);</script>Calling each one of his lord’s
debtors to him, he said to the first, ‘How much do you owe to my
lord?’ <script type="text/javascript">cj(16,6);</script>He said, ‘A <a
href="#N38">hundred batos</a> of oil.’ He said to him, ‘Take your
bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,7);</script>Then he said to another, ‘How
much do you owe?’ He said, ‘A <a href="#N39">hundred cors</a> of
wheat.’ He said to him, ‘Take your bill, and write eighty.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,8);</script>“His lord commended the
dishonest manager because he had done wisely, for the children of this
world are, in their own generation, wiser than the children of the light.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(16,9);</script>I tell you, make for
yourselves friends by means of unrighteous mammon, so that when you fail,
they may receive you into the eternal tents. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,10);</script>He who is faithful in a very
little is faithful also in much. He who is dishonest in a very little is
also dishonest in much. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,11);</script>If therefore you have not been
faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true
riches? <script type="text/javascript">cj(16,12);</script>If you have not
been faithful in that which is another’s, who will give you that which
is your own? <script type="text/javascript">cj(16,13);</script>No servant
can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one, and love the
other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the other. You aren’t
able to serve God and <a href="#N40">mammon</a>.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,14);</script>The Pharisees, who
were lovers of money, also heard all these things, and they scoffed at
him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,15);</script>He said to them,
<span class="j">“You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of
men, but God knows your hearts. For that which is exalted among men is an
abomination in the sight of God. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,16);</script>The law and the prophets were
until John. From that time the Good News of the Kingdom of God is
preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,17);</script>But it is easier for heaven and
earth to pass away, than for one tiny stroke of a pen in the law to fall.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(16,18);</script>Everyone who divorces
his wife, and marries another, commits adultery. He who marries one who is
divorced from a husband commits adultery.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,19);</script>“Now there was a certain rich
man, and he was clothed in purple and fine linen, living in luxury every
day. <script type="text/javascript">cj(16,20);</script>A certain beggar,
named Lazarus, was laid at his gate, full of sores, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,21);</script>and desiring to be fed with the
crumbs that fell from the rich man’s table. Yes, even the dogs came and
licked his sores. <script type="text/javascript">cj(16,22);</script>It
happened that the beggar died, and that he was carried away by the angels
to Abraham’s bosom. The rich man also died, and was buried. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,23);</script>In <a href="#N41">Hades</a>, he
lifted up his eyes, being in torment, and saw Abraham far off, and Lazarus
at his bosom. <script type="text/javascript">cj(16,24);</script>He cried
and said, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he
may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue! For I am in
anguish in this flame.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,25);</script>“But Abraham said, ‘Son,
remember that you, in your lifetime, received your good things, and
Lazarus, in the same way, bad things. But now here he is comforted and you
are in anguish. <script type="text/javascript">cj(16,26);</script>Besides
all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, that those who
want to pass from here to you are not able, and that none may cross over
from there to us.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,27);</script>“He said, ‘I ask you
therefore, father, that you would send him to my father’s house; <script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,28);</script>for I have five brothers, that
he may testify to them, so they won’t also come into this place of
torment.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,29);</script>“But Abraham said to him,
‘They have Moses and the prophets. Let them listen to them.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,30);</script>“He said, ‘No, father
Abraham, but if one goes to them from the dead, they will repent.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,31);</script>“He said to him, ‘If they
don’t listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded
if one rises from the dead.’”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,1);</script>He said to the
disciples, <span class="j">“It is impossible that no occasions of
stumbling should come, but woe to him through whom they come! <script
type="text/javascript">cj(17,2);</script>It would be better for him if a
millstone were hung around his neck, and he were thrown into the sea,
rather than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(17,3);</script>Be careful. If your
brother sins against you, rebuke him. If he repents, forgive him. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(17,4);</script>If he sins against you seven
times in the day, and seven times returns, saying, ‘I repent,’ you
shall forgive him.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,5);</script>The apostles said to
the Lord, “Increase our faith.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,6);</script>The Lord said, <span
class="j">“If you had faith like a grain of mustard seed, you would tell
this sycamore tree, ‘Be uprooted, and be planted in the sea,’ and it
would obey you. <script type="text/javascript">cj(17,7);</script>But who
is there among you, having a servant plowing or keeping sheep, that will
say, when he comes in from the field, ‘Come immediately and sit down at
the table,’ <script type="text/javascript">cj(17,8);</script>and will
not rather tell him, ‘Prepare my supper, clothe yourself properly, and
serve me, while I eat and drink. Afterward you shall eat and drink’?
<script type="text/javascript">cj(17,9);</script>Does he thank that
servant because he did the things that were commanded? I think not.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(17,10);</script>Even so you also, when
you have done all the things that are commanded you, say, ‘We are
unworthy servants. We have done our duty.’”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,11);</script>It happened as he was
on his way to Jerusalem, that he was passing along the borders of Samaria
and Galilee. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,12);</script>As he
entered into a certain village, ten men who were lepers met him, who stood
at a distance. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,13);</script>They
lifted up their voices, saying, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,14);</script>When he saw them, he
said to them, <span class="j">“Go and show yourselves to the
priests.”</span> It happened that as they went, they were cleansed.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(17,15);</script>One of them, when he saw
that he was healed, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,16);</script>He fell on his face at Jesus’
feet, giving him thanks; and he was a Samaritan. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,17);</script>Jesus answered, <span
class="j">“Weren’t the ten cleansed? But where are the nine? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(17,18);</script>Were there none found who
returned to give glory to God, except this stranger?”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,19);</script>Then he said to him, <span
class="j">“Get up, and go your way. Your faith has healed you.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,20);</script>Being asked by the
Pharisees when the Kingdom of God would come, he answered them, <span
class="j">“The Kingdom of God doesn’t come with observation; <script
type="text/javascript">cj(17,21);</script>neither will they say, ‘Look,
here!’ or, ‘Look, there!’ for behold, the Kingdom of God is within
you.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,22);</script>He said to the
disciples, <span class="j">“The days will come, when you will desire to
see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(17,23);</script>They will tell you, ‘Look,
here!’ or ‘Look, there!’ Don’t go away, nor follow after them,
<script type="text/javascript">cj(17,24);</script>for as the lightning,
when it flashes out of the one part under the sky, shines to the other
part under the sky; so will the Son of Man be in his day. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(17,25);</script>But first, he must suffer many
things and be rejected by this generation. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(17,26);</script>As it happened in the days of
Noah, even so will it be also in the days of the Son of Man. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(17,27);</script>They ate, they drank, they
married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into
the ship, and the flood came, and destroyed them all. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(17,28);</script>Likewise, even as it happened in
the days of Lot: they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they
planted, they built; <script type="text/javascript">cj(17,29);</script>but
in the day that Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and sulfur from
the sky, and destroyed them all. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(17,30);</script>It will be the same way in the
day that the Son of Man is revealed. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(17,31);</script>In that day, he who will be on
the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them
away. Let him who is in the field likewise not turn back. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(17,32);</script>Remember Lot’s wife! <script
type="text/javascript">cj(17,33);</script>Whoever seeks to save his life
loses it, but whoever loses his life preserves it. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(17,34);</script>I tell you, in that night there
will be two people in one bed. The one will be taken, and the other will
be left. <script type="text/javascript">cj(17,35);</script>There will be
two grinding grain together. One will be taken, and the other will be
left.”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,36);</script><font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N42">*</a></sup></font>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,37);</script>They, answering,
asked him, “Where, Lord?”
<p>He said to them, <span class="j">“Where the body is, there will the
vultures also be gathered together.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,1);</script>He also spoke a
parable to them that they must always pray, and not give up, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,2);</script>saying, <span class="j">“There
was a judge in a certain city who didn’t fear God, and didn’t respect
man. <script type="text/javascript">cj(18,3);</script>A widow was in that
city, and she often came to him, saying, ‘Defend me from my
adversary!’ <script type="text/javascript">cj(18,4);</script>He
wouldn’t for a while, but afterward he said to himself, ‘Though I
neither fear God, nor respect man, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,5);</script>yet because this widow bothers
me, I will defend her, or else she will wear me out by her continual
coming.’”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,6);</script>The Lord said, <span
class="j">“Listen to what the unrighteous judge says. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,7);</script>Won’t God avenge his chosen
ones, who are crying out to him day and night, and yet he exercises
patience with them? <script type="text/javascript">cj(18,8);</script>I
tell you that he will avenge them quickly. Nevertheless, when the Son of
Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,9);</script>He spoke also this
parable to certain people who were convinced of their own righteousness,
and who despised all others. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,10);</script><span class="j">“Two men went
up into the temple to pray; one was a Pharisee, and the other was a tax
collector. <script type="text/javascript">cj(18,11);</script>The Pharisee
stood and prayed to himself like this: ‘God, I thank you, that I am not
like the rest of men, extortioners, unrighteous, adulterers, or even like
this tax collector. <script type="text/javascript">cj(18,12);</script>I
fast twice a week. I give tithes of all that I get.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,13);</script>But the tax collector, standing
far away, wouldn’t even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast,
saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner!’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,14);</script>I tell you, this man went down
to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts
himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be
exalted.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,15);</script>They were also
bringing their babies to him, that he might touch them. But when the
disciples saw it, they rebuked them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,16);</script>Jesus summoned them, saying,
<span class="j">“Allow the little children to come to me, and don’t
hinder them, for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,17);</script>Most certainly, I tell you,
whoever doesn’t receive the Kingdom of God like a little child, he will
in no way enter into it.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,18);</script>A certain ruler asked
him, saying, “Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,19);</script>Jesus asked him,
<span class="j">“Why do you call me good? No one is good, except
one—God. <script type="text/javascript">cj(18,20);</script>You know the
commandments: ‘Don’t commit adultery,’ ‘Don’t murder,’
‘Don’t steal,’ ‘Don’t give false testimony,’ ‘Honor your
father and your mother.’”</span><font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,21);</script>He said, “I have
observed all these things from my youth up.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,22);</script>When Jesus heard
these things, he said to him, <span class="j">“You still lack one thing.
Sell all that you have, and distribute it to the poor. You will have
treasure in heaven. Come, follow me.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,23);</script>But when he heard
these things, he became very sad, for he was very rich.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,24);</script>Jesus, seeing that he
became very sad, said, <span class="j">“How hard it is for those who
have riches to enter into the Kingdom of God! <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,25);</script>For it is easier for a camel to
enter in through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the
Kingdom of God.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,26);</script>Those who heard it
said, “Then who can be saved?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,27);</script>But he said, <span
class="j">“The things which are impossible with men are possible with
God.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,28);</script>Peter said, “Look,
we have left everything, and followed you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,29);</script>He said to them,
<span class="j">“Most certainly I tell you, there is no one who has left
house, or wife, or brothers, or parents, or children, for the Kingdom of
God’s sake, <script type="text/javascript">cj(18,30);</script>who will
not receive many times more in this time, and in the world to come,
eternal life.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,31);</script>He took the twelve
aside, and said to them, <span class="j">“Behold, we are going up to
Jerusalem, and all the things that are written through the prophets
concerning the Son of Man will be completed. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,32);</script>For he will be delivered up to
the Gentiles, will be mocked, treated shamefully, and spit on. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,33);</script>They will scourge and kill him.
On the third day, he will rise again.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,34);</script>They understood none
of these things. This saying was hidden from them, and they didn’t
understand the things that were said. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,35);</script>It happened, as he came near
Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the road, begging. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,36);</script>Hearing a multitude going by, he
asked what this meant. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,37);</script>They told him that Jesus of
Nazareth was passing by. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,38);</script>He cried out, “Jesus, you son
of David, have mercy on me!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,39);</script>Those who led the way rebuked
him, that he should be quiet; but he cried out all the more, “You son of
David, have mercy on me!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,40);</script>Standing still, Jesus
commanded him to be brought to him. When he had come near, he asked him,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,41);</script><span class="j">“What
do you want me to do?”</span>
<p>He said, “Lord, that I may see again.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,42);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“Receive your sight. Your faith has healed you.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,43);</script>Immediately he
received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God. All the people, when
they saw it, praised God.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,1);</script>He entered and was
passing through Jericho. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,2);</script>There was a man named Zacchaeus.
He was a chief tax collector, and he was rich. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,3);</script>He was trying to see who Jesus
was, and couldn’t because of the crowd, because he was short. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,4);</script>He ran on ahead, and climbed up
into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was to pass that way. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,5);</script>When Jesus came to the place, he
looked up and saw him, and said to him, <span class="j">“Zacchaeus,
hurry and come down, for today I must stay at your house.”</span>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(19,6);</script>He hurried, came down,
and received him joyfully. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,7);</script>When they saw it, they all
murmured, saying, “He has gone in to lodge with a man who is a sinner.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,8);</script>Zacchaeus stood and
said to the Lord, “Behold, Lord, half of my goods I give to the poor. If
I have wrongfully exacted anything of anyone, I restore four times as
much.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,9);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“Today, salvation has come to this house, because he
also is a son of Abraham. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(19,10);</script>For the Son of Man came to seek
and to save that which was lost.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,11);</script>As they heard these
things, he went on and told a parable, because he was near Jerusalem, and
they supposed that the Kingdom of God would be revealed immediately.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(19,12);</script>He said therefore, <span
class="j">“A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for
himself a kingdom, and to return. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(19,13);</script>He called ten servants of his,
and gave them <a href="#N44">ten mina coins,</a> and told them, ‘Conduct
business until I come.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(19,14);</script>But his citizens hated him, and
sent an envoy after him, saying, ‘We don’t want this man to reign over
us.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(19,15);</script>“It happened when he had come
back again, having received the kingdom, that he commanded these servants,
to whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know
what they had gained by conducting business. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(19,16);</script>The first came before him,
saying, ‘Lord, your mina has made ten more minas.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(19,17);</script>“He said to him, ‘Well done,
you good servant! Because you were found faithful with very little, you
shall have authority over ten cities.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(19,18);</script>“The second came, saying,
‘Your mina, Lord, has made five minas.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(19,19);</script>“So he said to him, ‘And you
are to be over five cities.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(19,20);</script>Another came, saying, ‘Lord,
behold, your mina, which I kept laid away in a handkerchief, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(19,21);</script>for I feared you, because you
are an exacting man. You take up that which you didn’t lay down, and
reap that which you didn’t sow.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(19,22);</script>“He said to him, ‘Out of
your own mouth will I judge you, you wicked servant! You knew that I am an
exacting man, taking up that which I didn’t lay down, and reaping that
which I didn’t sow. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(19,23);</script>Then why didn’t you deposit my
money in the bank, and at my coming, I might have earned interest on
it?’ <script type="text/javascript">cj(19,24);</script>He said to those
who stood by, ‘Take the mina away from him, and give it to him who has
the ten minas.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(19,25);</script>“They said to him, ‘Lord, he
has ten minas!’ <script type="text/javascript">cj(19,26);</script>‘For
I tell you that to everyone who has, will more be given; but from him who
doesn’t have, even that which he has will be taken away from him.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(19,27);</script>But bring those enemies
of mine who didn’t want me to reign over them here, and kill them before
me.’”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,28);</script>Having
said these things, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,29);</script>It happened, when he
drew near to <a href="#N45">Bethsphage</a> and Bethany, at the mountain
that is called Olivet, he sent two of his disciples, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,30);</script>saying, <span class="j">“Go
your way into the village on the other side, in which, as you enter, you
will find a colt tied, whereon no man ever yet sat. Untie it, and bring
it. <script type="text/javascript">cj(19,31);</script>If anyone asks you,
‘Why are you untying it?’ say to him: ‘The Lord needs
it.’”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,32);</script>Those who were sent
went away, and found things just as he had told them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,33);</script>As they were untying the colt,
its owners said to them, “Why are you untying the colt?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,34);</script>They said, “The Lord needs
it.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,35);</script>They brought it
to Jesus. They threw their cloaks on the colt, and set Jesus on them.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(19,36);</script>As he went, they spread
their cloaks in the way. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,37);</script>As he was now getting near, at
the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples
began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works
which they had seen, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,38);</script>saying, “Blessed is the King
who comes in the name of the Lord!<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N46">*</a></sup></font> Peace in heaven, and glory in the
highest!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,39);</script>Some of the Pharisees
from the multitude said to him, “Teacher, rebuke your disciples!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,40);</script>He answered them,
<span class="j">“I tell you that if these were silent, the stones would
cry out.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,41);</script>When he drew near, he
saw the city and wept over it, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,42);</script>saying, <span class="j">“If
you, even you, had known today the things which belong to your peace! But
now, they are hidden from your eyes. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(19,43);</script>For the days will come on you,
when your enemies will throw up a barricade against you, surround you, hem
you in on every side, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(19,44);</script>and will dash you and your
children within you to the ground. They will not leave in you one stone on
another, because you didn’t know the time of your visitation.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,45);</script>He entered into the
temple, and began to drive out those who bought and sold in it, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,46);</script>saying to them, <span
class="j">“It is written, ‘My house is a house of prayer,’<font

have made it a ‘den of robbers’!”</span><font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N48">*</a></sup></font>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,47);</script>He was teaching daily
in the temple, but the chief priests and the scribes and the leading men
among the people sought to destroy him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,48);</script>They couldn’t find what they
might do, for all the people hung on to every word that he said.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,1);</script>It happened on one of
those days, as he was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the
Good News, that the <font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N49">*</a></sup></font>priests and scribes came to him with the
elders. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,2);</script>They asked him,
“Tell us: by what authority do you do these things? Or who is giving you
this authority?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,3);</script>He answered them,
<span class="j">“I also will ask you one question. Tell me: <script
type="text/javascript">cj(20,4);</script>the baptism of John, was it from
heaven, or from men?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,5);</script>They reasoned with
themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Why
didn’t you believe him?’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,6);</script>But if we say, ‘From men,’
all the people will stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a
prophet.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,7);</script>They answered
that they didn’t know where it was from.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,8);</script>Jesus said to them,
<span class="j">“Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these
things.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,9);</script>He began to tell the
people this parable. <span class="j">“A <font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N50">*</a></sup></font>man planted a vineyard, and
rented it out to some farmers, and went into another country for a long
time. <script type="text/javascript">cj(20,10);</script>At the proper
season, he sent a servant to the farmers to collect his share of the fruit
of the vineyard. But the farmers beat him, and sent him away empty.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(20,11);</script>He sent yet another
servant, and they also beat him, and treated him shamefully, and sent him
away empty. <script type="text/javascript">cj(20,12);</script>He sent yet
a third, and they also wounded him, and threw him out. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(20,13);</script>The lord of the vineyard said,
‘What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. It may be that seeing him,
they will respect him.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(20,14);</script>“But when the farmers saw him,
they reasoned among themselves, saying, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s
kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(20,15);</script>They threw him out of the
vineyard, and killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do
to them? <script type="text/javascript">cj(20,16);</script>He will come
and destroy these farmers, and will give the vineyard to others.”</span>
<p>When they heard it, they said, “May it never be!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,17);</script>But he looked at
them, and said, <span class="j">“Then what is this that is written,</span>
<dl><span class="j">

<dd>but it will crush whomever it falls on to dust.”</span>
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,19);</script>The chief priests and
the scribes sought to lay hands on him that very hour, but they feared the
people—for they knew he had spoken this parable against them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,20);</script>They watched him, and sent out
spies, who pretended to be righteous, that they might trap him in
something he said, so as to deliver him up to the power and authority of
the governor. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,21);</script>They asked
him, “Teacher, we know that you say and teach what is right, and
aren’t partial to anyone, but truly teach the way of God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,22);</script>Is it lawful for us to pay taxes
to Caesar, or not?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,23);</script>But he perceived
their craftiness, and said to them, <span class="j">“Why do you test me?
<script type="text/javascript">cj(20,24);</script>Show me a denarius.
Whose image and inscription are on it?”</span>
<p>They answered, “Caesar’s.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,25);</script>He said to them,
<span class="j">“Then give to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and
to God the things that are God’s.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,26);</script>They weren’t able
to trap him in his words before the people. They marveled at his answer,
and were silent. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,27);</script>Some of
the Sadducees came to him, those who deny that there is a resurrection.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(20,28);</script>They asked him,
“Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if a man’s brother dies having a
wife, and he is childless, his brother should take the wife, and raise up
children for his brother. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,29);</script>There were therefore seven
brothers. The first took a wife, and died childless. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,30);</script>The second took her as wife, and
he died childless. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,31);</script>The
third took her, and likewise the seven all left no children, and died.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(20,32);</script>Afterward the woman also
died. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,33);</script>Therefore in the
resurrection whose wife of them will she be? For the seven had her as a
wife.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,34);</script>Jesus said to them,
<span class="j">“The children of this age marry, and are given in
marriage. <script type="text/javascript">cj(20,35);</script>But those who
are considered worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the
dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(20,36);</script>For they can’t die any more,
for they are like the angels, and are children of God, being children of
the resurrection. <script type="text/javascript">cj(20,37);</script>But
that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the bush, when he called
the Lord ‘The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of
Jacob.’<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N52">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cj(20,38);</script>Now he is not the God of the
dead, but of the living, for all are alive to him.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,39);</script>Some of the scribes
answered, “Teacher, you speak well.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,40);</script>They didn’t dare to ask him
any more questions.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,41);</script>He said to them,
<span class="j">“Why do they say that the Christ is David’s son?
<script type="text/javascript">cj(20,42);</script>David himself says in
the book of Psalms,</span>

</span><p><span class="j"><script

Lord, so how is he his son?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,45);</script>In the hearing of all
the people, he said to his disciples, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,46);</script><span class="j">“Beware of the
scribes, who like to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the
marketplaces, the best seats in the synagogues, and the best places at
feasts; <script type="text/javascript">cj(20,47);</script>who devour
widows’ houses, and for a pretense make long prayers: these will receive
greater condemnation.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,1);</script>He looked up, and saw
the rich people who were putting their gifts into the treasury. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,2);</script>He saw a certain poor widow
casting in <a href="#N54">two small brass coins.</a> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,3);</script>He said, <span class="j">“Truly
I tell you, this poor widow put in more than all of them, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(21,4);</script>for all these put in gifts for
God from their abundance, but she, out of her poverty, put in all that she
had to live on.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,5);</script>As some were talking
about the temple and how it was decorated with beautiful stones and gifts,
he said, <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,6);</script><span
class="j">“As for these things which you see, the days will come, in
which there will not be left here one stone on another that will not be
thrown down.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,7);</script>They asked him,
“Teacher, so when will these things be? What is the sign that these
things are about to happen?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,8);</script>He said, <span
class="j">“Watch out that you don’t get led astray, for many will come
in my name, saying, ‘<a href="#N55">I am he</a>,’ and, ‘The time is
at hand.’ Therefore don’t follow them. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(21,9);</script>When you hear of wars and
disturbances, don’t be terrified, for these things must happen first,
but the end won’t come immediately.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,10);</script>Then he said to them,
<span class="j">“Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against
kingdom. <script type="text/javascript">cj(21,11);</script>There will be
great earthquakes, famines, and plagues in various places. There will be
terrors and great signs from heaven. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(21,12);</script>But before all these things,
they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you, delivering you up
to synagogues and prisons, bringing you before kings and governors for my
name’s sake. <script type="text/javascript">cj(21,13);</script>It will
turn out as a testimony for you. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(21,14);</script>Settle it therefore in your
hearts not to meditate beforehand how to answer, <script

wisdom which all your adversaries will not be able to withstand or to
contradict. <script type="text/javascript">cj(21,16);</script>You will be
handed over even by parents, brothers, relatives, and friends. They will
cause some of you to be put to death. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(21,17);</script>You will be hated by all men for
my name’s sake. <script type="text/javascript">cj(21,18);</script>And
not a hair of your head will perish.

flee to the mountains. Let those who are in the midst of her depart. Let
those who are in the country not enter therein. <script

distress in the land, and wrath to this people. <script

perplexity for the roaring of the sea and the waves; <script

expectation of the things which are coming on the world: for the powers of
the heavens will be shaken. <script

Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. <script

happen, look up, and lift up your heads, because your redemption is
near.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,29);</script>He told them a
parable. <span class="j">“See the fig tree, and all the trees. <script

you see it and know by your own selves that the summer is already near.

you see these things happening, know that the Kingdom of God is near.

you, this generation will not pass away until all things are accomplished.

all those who dwell on the surface of all the earth. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(21,36);</script>Therefore be watchful all the
time, praying that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things
that will happen, and to stand before the Son of Man.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,37);</script>Every day Jesus was
teaching in the temple, and every night he would go out and spend the
night on the mountain that is called Olivet. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,38);</script>All the people came early in the
morning to him in the temple to hear him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,1);</script>Now the feast of
unleavened bread, which is called the Passover, drew near. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,2);</script>The chief priests and the scribes
sought how they might put him to death, for they feared the people.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(22,3);</script>Satan entered into Judas,
who was surnamed Iscariot, who was numbered with the twelve. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,4);</script>He went away, and talked with the
chief priests and captains about how he might deliver him to them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,5);</script>They were glad, and agreed to
give him money. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,6);</script>He
consented, and sought an opportunity to deliver him to them in the absence
of the multitude. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,7);</script>The day
of unleavened bread came, on which the Passover must be sacrificed.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(22,8);</script>He sent Peter and John,
saying, <span class="j">“Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may
eat.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,9);</script>They said to him,
“Where do you want us to prepare?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,10);</script>He said to them,
<span class="j">“Behold, when you have entered into the city, a man
carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him into the house which
he enters. <script type="text/javascript">cj(22,11);</script>Tell the
master of the house, ‘The Teacher says to you, “Where is the guest
room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?”’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(22,12);</script>He will show you a large,
furnished upper room. Make preparations there.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,13);</script>They went, found
things as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,14);</script>When the hour had come, he sat
down with the twelve apostles. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,15);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before
I suffer, <script type="text/javascript">cj(22,16);</script>for I tell
you, I will no longer by any means eat of it until it is fulfilled in the
Kingdom of God.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,17);</script>He received a cup, and when he
had given thanks, he said, <span class="j">“Take this, and share it
among yourselves, <script type="text/javascript">cj(22,18);</script>for I
tell you, I will not drink at all again from the fruit of the vine, until
the Kingdom of God comes.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,19);</script>He took bread, and
when he had given thanks, he broke it, and gave to them, saying, <span
class="j">“This is my body which is given for you. Do this in memory of
me.”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,20);</script>Likewise,
he took the cup after supper, saying, <span class="j">“This cup is the
new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(22,21);</script>But behold, the hand of him who
betrays me is with me on the table. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(22,22);</script>The Son of Man indeed goes, as
it has been determined, but woe to that man through whom he is
betrayed!”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,23);</script>They began to
question among themselves, which of them it was who would do this thing.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(22,24);</script>There arose also a
contention among them, which of them was considered to be greatest.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(22,25);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“The kings of the nations lord it over them, and those who
have authority over them are called ‘benefactors.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(22,26);</script>But not so with you. But one who
is the greater among you, let him become as the younger, and one who is
governing, as one who serves. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(22,27);</script>For who is greater, one who sits
at the table, or one who serves? Isn’t it he who sits at the table? But
I am in the midst of you as one who serves. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(22,28);</script>But you are those who have
continued with me in my trials. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(22,29);</script>I confer on you a kingdom, even
as my Father conferred on me, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(22,30);</script>that you may eat and drink at my
table in my Kingdom. You will sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of
Israel.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,31);</script>The Lord said, <span
class="j">“Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked to have you, that he might
sift you as wheat, <script type="text/javascript">cj(22,32);</script>but I
prayed for you, that your faith wouldn’t fail. You, when once you have
turned again, establish your <a href="#N56">brothers</a>.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,33);</script>He said to him,
“Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,34);</script>He said, <span
class="j">“I tell you, Peter, the rooster will by no means crow today
until you deny that you know me three times.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,35);</script>He said to them,
<span class="j">“When I sent you out without purse, and wallet, and
shoes, did you lack anything?”</span>
<p>They said, “Nothing.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,36);</script>Then he said to them,
<span class="j">“But now, whoever has a purse, let him take it, and
likewise a wallet. Whoever has none, let him sell his cloak, and buy a
sword. <script type="text/javascript">cj(22,37);</script>For I tell you
that this which is written must still be fulfilled in me: ‘He was
counted with transgressors.’<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N57">*</a></sup></font> For that which concerns me has an
end.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,38);</script>They said, “Lord,
behold, here are two swords.”
<p>He said to them, <span class="j">“That is enough.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,39);</script>He came out, and
went, as his custom was, to the Mount of Olives. His disciples also
followed him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,40);</script>When he
was at the place, he said to them, <span class="j">“Pray that you
don’t enter into temptation.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,41);</script>He was withdrawn from
them about a stone’s throw, and he knelt down and prayed, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,42);</script>saying, <span
class="j">“Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me.
Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,43);</script>An angel from heaven
appeared to him, strengthening him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,44);</script>Being in agony he prayed more
earnestly. His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the
ground.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,45);</script>When he rose up from
his prayer, he came to the disciples, and found them sleeping because of
grief, <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,46);</script>and said to them,
<span class="j">“Why do you sleep? Rise and pray that you may not enter
into temptation.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,47);</script>While he was still
speaking, behold, a multitude, and he who was called Judas, one of the
twelve, was leading them. He came near to Jesus to kiss him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,48);</script>But Jesus said to him, <span
class="j">“Judas, do you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,49);</script>When those who were
around him saw what was about to happen, they said to him, “Lord, shall
we strike with the sword?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,50);</script>A certain one of them struck the
servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,51);</script>But Jesus answered,
<span class="j">“Let me at least do this”</span>—and he touched his
ear, and healed him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,52);</script>Jesus said to the chief priests,
captains of the temple, and elders, who had come against him, <span
class="j">“Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?
<script type="text/javascript">cj(22,53);</script>When I was with you in
the temple daily, you didn’t stretch out your hands against me. But this
is your hour, and the power of darkness.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,54);</script>They seized him, and
led him away, and brought him into the high priest’s house. But Peter
followed from a distance. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,55);</script>When they had kindled a fire in
the middle of the courtyard, and had sat down together, Peter sat among
them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,56);</script>A certain servant
girl saw him as he sat in the light, and looking intently at him, said,
“This man also was with him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,57);</script>He denied Jesus,
saying, “Woman, I don’t know him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,58);</script>After a little while
someone else saw him, and said, “You also are one of them!”
<p>But Peter answered, “Man, I am not!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,59);</script>After about one hour
passed, another confidently affirmed, saying, “Truly this man also was
with him, for he is a Galilean!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,60);</script>But Peter said,
“Man, I don’t know what you are talking about!” Immediately, while
he was still speaking, a rooster crowed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,61);</script>The Lord turned, and looked at
Peter. Then Peter remembered the Lord’s word, how he said to him, <span
class="j">“Before the rooster crows you will deny me three
times.”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,62);</script>He went
out, and wept bitterly.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,63);</script>The men who held
Jesus mocked him and beat him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,64);</script>Having blindfolded him, they
struck him on the face and asked him, “Prophesy! Who is the one who
struck you?” <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,65);</script>They
spoke many other things against him, insulting him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,66);</script>As soon as it was
day, the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together, both
chief priests and scribes, and they led him away into their council,
saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,67);</script>“If you are
the Christ, tell us.”
<p>But he said to them, <span class="j">“If I tell you, you won’t
believe, <script type="text/javascript">cj(22,68);</script>and if I ask,
you will in no way answer me or let me go. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(22,69);</script>From now on, the Son of Man will
be seated at the right hand of the power of God.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,70);</script>They all said, “Are
you then the Son of God?”
<p>He said to them, <span class="j">“You say it, because I am.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,71);</script>They said, “Why do
we need any more witness? For we ourselves have heard from his own
mouth!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,1);</script>The whole company of
them rose up and brought him before Pilate. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,2);</script>They began to accuse him, saying,
“We found this man perverting the nation, forbidding paying taxes to
Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, a king.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,3);</script>Pilate asked him,
“Are you the King of the Jews?”
<p>He answered him, <span class="j">“So you say.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,4);</script>Pilate said to the
chief priests and the multitudes, “I find no basis for a charge against
this man.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,5);</script>But they insisted,
saying, “He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea,
beginning from Galilee even to this place.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,6);</script>But when Pilate heard Galilee
mentioned, he asked if the man was a Galilean. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,7);</script>When he found out that he was in
Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem
during those days.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,8);</script>Now when Herod saw
Jesus, he was exceedingly glad, for he had wanted to see him for a long
time, because he had heard many things about him. He hoped to see some
miracle done by him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,9);</script>He
questioned him with many words, but he gave no answers. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,10);</script>The chief priests and the
scribes stood, vehemently accusing him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,11);</script>Herod with his soldiers
humiliated him and mocked him. Dressing him in luxurious clothing, they
sent him back to Pilate. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,12);</script>Herod and Pilate became friends
with each other that very day, for before that they were enemies with each
other.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,13);</script>Pilate called
together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,14);</script>and said to them, “You brought
this man to me as one that perverts the people, and see, I have examined
him before you, and found no basis for a charge against this man
concerning those things of which you accuse him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,15);</script>Neither has Herod, for I sent
you to him, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,16);</script>I will therefore chastise him
and release him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,17);</script>Now he had to release
one prisoner to them at the feast. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,18);</script>But they all cried out together,
saying, “Away with this man! Release to us Barabbas!”—<script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,19);</script>one who was thrown into prison
for a certain revolt in the city, and for murder.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,20);</script>Then Pilate spoke to
them again, wanting to release Jesus, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,21);</script>but they shouted, saying,
“Crucify! Crucify him!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,22);</script>He said to them the
third time, “Why? What evil has this man done? I have found no capital
crime in him. I will therefore chastise him and release him.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,23);</script>But they were urgent with loud
voices, asking that he might be crucified. Their voices and the voices of
the chief priests prevailed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,24);</script>Pilate decreed that what they
asked for should be done. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,25);</script>He released him who had been
thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but
he delivered Jesus up to their will.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,26);</script>When they led him
away, they grabbed one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid
on him the cross, to carry it after Jesus. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,27);</script>A great multitude of the people
followed him, including women who also mourned and lamented him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,28);</script>But Jesus, turning to them,
said, <span class="j">“Daughters of Jerusalem, don’t weep for me, but
weep for yourselves and for your children. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(23,29);</script>For behold, the days are coming
in which they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never
bore, and the breasts that never nursed.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(23,30);</script>Then they will begin to tell the
mountains, ‘Fall on us!’ and tell the hills, ‘Cover us.’<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N58">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cj(23,31);</script>For if they do these things in
the green tree, what will be done in the dry?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,32);</script>There were also
others, two criminals, led with him to be put to death. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,33);</script>When they came to the place that
is called The Skull, they crucified him there with the criminals, one on
the right and the other on the left.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,34);</script>Jesus said, <span
class="j">“Father, forgive them, for they don’t know what they are
doing.”</span>
<p>Dividing his garments among them, they cast lots. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,35);</script>The people stood watching. The
rulers with them also scoffed at him, saying, “He saved others. Let him
save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen one!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,36);</script>The soldiers also
mocked him, coming to him and offering him vinegar, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,37);</script>and saying, “If you are the
King of the Jews, save yourself!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,38);</script>An inscription was
also written over him in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew: “THIS IS
THE KING OF THE JEWS.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,39);</script>One of the criminals
who was hanged insulted him, saying, “If you are the Christ, save
yourself and us!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,40);</script>But the other
answered, and rebuking him said, “Don’t you even fear God, seeing you
are under the same condemnation? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,41);</script>And we indeed justly, for we
receive the due reward for our deeds, but this man has done nothing
wrong.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,42);</script>He said to
Jesus, “Lord, remember me when you come into your Kingdom.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,43);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“Assuredly I tell you, today you will be with me in
Paradise.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,44);</script>It was now <a
href="#N59">about the sixth hour</a>, and darkness came over the whole
land until <a href="#N60">the ninth hour.</a> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,45);</script>The sun was darkened, and the
veil of the temple was torn in two. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,46);</script>Jesus, crying with a loud voice,
said, <span class="j">“Father, into your hands I commit my
spirit!”</span> Having said this, he breathed his last.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,47);</script>When the centurion
saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, “Certainly this was a
righteous man.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,48);</script>All
the multitudes that came together to see this, when they saw the things
that were done, returned home beating their breasts. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,49);</script>All his acquaintances, and the
women who followed with him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching
these things.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,50);</script>Behold, a man named
Joseph, who was a member of the council, a good and righteous man <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,51);</script>(he had not consented to their
counsel and deed), from Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who was also
waiting for the Kingdom of God: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,52);</script>this man went to Pilate, and
asked for Jesus’ body. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,53);</script>He took it down, and wrapped it
in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone, where no
one had ever been laid. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,54);</script>It was the day of the
Preparation, and the Sabbath was drawing near. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,55);</script>The women, who had come with him
out of Galilee, followed after, and saw the tomb, and how his body was
laid. <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,56);</script>They returned, and
prepared spices and ointments. On the Sabbath they rested according to the
commandment.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,1);</script>But on the first day
of the week, at early dawn, they and some others came to the tomb,
bringing the spices which they had prepared. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,2);</script>They found the stone rolled away
from the tomb. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,3);</script>They
entered in, and didn’t find the Lord Jesus’ body. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,4);</script>It happened, while they were
greatly perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling
clothing. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,5);</script>Becoming
terrified, they bowed their faces down to the earth.
<p>They said to them, “Why do you seek the living among the dead?
<script type="text/javascript">cb(24,6);</script>He isn’t here, but is
risen. Remember what he told you when he was still in Galilee, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,7);</script>saying that the Son of Man must
be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the
third day rise again?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,8);</script>They remembered his
words, <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,9);</script>returned from the
tomb, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(24,10);</script>Now they were Mary
Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary the mother of James. The other women with them
told these things to the apostles. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,11);</script>These words seemed to them to be
nonsense, and they didn’t believe them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,12);</script>But Peter got up and ran to the
tomb. Stooping and looking in, he saw the strips of linen lying by
themselves, and he departed to his home, wondering what had happened.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,13);</script>Behold, two of them
were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was <a
href="#N61">sixty stadia</a> from Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,14);</script>They talked with each other
about all of these things which had happened. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,15);</script>It happened, while they talked
and questioned together, that Jesus himself came near, and went with them.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(24,16);</script>But their eyes were kept
from recognizing him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,17);</script>He
said to them, <span class="j">“What are you talking about as you walk,
and are sad?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,18);</script>One of them, named
Cleopas, answered him, “Are you the only stranger in Jerusalem who
doesn’t know the things which have happened there in these days?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,19);</script>He said to them,
<span class="j">“What things?”</span>
<p>They said to him, “The things concerning Jesus, the Nazarene, who was
a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,20);</script>and how the chief priests and
our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(24,21);</script>But we were hoping that
it was he who would redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now
the third day since these things happened. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,22);</script>Also, certain women of our
company amazed us, having arrived early at the tomb; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,23);</script>and when they didn’t find his
body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, who
said that he was alive. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,24);</script>Some of us went to the tomb, and
found it just like the women had said, but they didn’t see him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,25);</script>He said to them,
<span class="j">“Foolish men, and slow of heart to believe in all that
the prophets have spoken! <script
type="text/javascript">cj(24,26);</script>Didn’t the Christ have to
suffer these things and to enter into his glory?”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,27);</script>Beginning from Moses and from
all the prophets, he explained to them in all the Scriptures the things
concerning himself. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,28);</script>They
drew near to the village, where they were going, and he acted like he
would go further.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,29);</script>They urged him,
saying, “Stay with us, for it is almost evening, and the day is almost
over.”
<p>He went in to stay with them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,30);</script>It happened, that when he had
sat down at the table with them, he took the bread and gave thanks.
Breaking it, he gave to them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,31);</script>Their eyes were opened, and they
recognized him, and he vanished out of their sight. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,32);</script>They said one to another,
“Weren’t our hearts burning within us, while he spoke to us along the
way, and while he opened the Scriptures to us?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,33);</script>They rose up that very hour,
returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and those
who were with them, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,34);</script>saying, “The Lord is risen
indeed, and has appeared to Simon!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,35);</script>They related the things that
happened along the way, and how he was recognized by them in the breaking
of the bread.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,36);</script>As they said these
things, Jesus himself stood among them, and said to them, <span
class="j">“Peace be to you.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,37);</script>But they were
terrified and filled with fear, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,38);</script>He said to them,
<span class="j">“Why are you troubled? Why do doubts arise in your
hearts? <script type="text/javascript">cj(24,39);</script>See my hands and
my feet, that it is truly me. Touch me and see, for a spirit doesn’t
have flesh and bones, as you see that I have.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,40);</script>When he had said this, he showed
them his hands and his feet. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,41);</script>While they still didn’t
believe for joy, and wondered, he said to them, <span class="j">“Do you
have anything here to eat?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,42);</script>They gave him a piece
of a broiled fish and some honeycomb. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,43);</script>He took them, and ate in front
of them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,44);</script>He said to
them, <span class="j">“This is what I told you, while I was still with
you, that all things which are written in the law of Moses, the prophets,
and the psalms, concerning me must be fulfilled.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,45);</script>Then he opened their
minds, that they might understand the Scriptures. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,46);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ
to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(24,47);</script>and that repentance and
remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations,
beginning at Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(24,48);</script>You are witnesses of these
things. <script type="text/javascript">cj(24,49);</script>Behold, I send
forth the promise of my Father on you. But wait in the city of Jerusalem
until you are clothed with power from on high.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,50);</script>He led them out as
far as Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,51);</script>It happened, while he blessed
them, that he withdrew from them, and was carried up into heaven. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,52);</script>They worshiped him, and returned
to Jerusalem with great joy, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,53);</script>and were continually in the
temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.
