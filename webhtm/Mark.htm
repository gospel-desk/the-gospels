The Good News According to Mark
</h1><p>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,1);</script>The beginning of the Good
News of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,2);</script>As it is written in the prophets,
<dl>
<dt>“Behold, I send my messenger before your face,
<dd>who will prepare your way before you.<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N1">*</a></sup></font>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,3);</script>The voice of one
crying in the wilderness,
<dd>‘Make ready the way of the Lord!
<dd>Make his paths straight!’”<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N2">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,4);</script>John came <a
href="#N3">baptizing</a> in the wilderness and preaching the baptism of
repentance for forgiveness of sins. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,5);</script>All the country of Judea and all
those of Jerusalem went out to him. They were baptized by him in the
Jordan river, confessing their sins. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,6);</script>John was clothed with camel’s
hair and a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,7);</script>He preached, saying,
“After me comes he who is mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals I
am not worthy to stoop down and loosen. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,8);</script>I baptized you <a
href="#N4">in</a> water, but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,9);</script>It happened in those
days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John
in the Jordan. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,10);</script>Immediately coming up from the
water, he saw the heavens parting, and the Spirit descending on him like a
dove. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,11);</script>A voice came out of
the sky, “You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,12);</script>Immediately the Spirit
drove him out into the wilderness. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,13);</script>He was there in the wilderness
forty days tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals; and the angels
were serving him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,14);</script>Now after John was
taken into custody, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the Good News of
the Kingdom of God, <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,15);</script>and
saying, <span class="j">“The time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God
is at hand! Repent, and believe in the Good News.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,16);</script>Passing along by the
sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net
into the sea, for they were fishermen. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,17);</script>Jesus said to them, <span
class="j">“Come after me, and I will make you into fishers for
men.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,18);</script>Immediately they left
their nets, and followed him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,19);</script>Going on a little further from
there, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother, who were
also in the boat mending the nets. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,20);</script>Immediately he called them, and
they left their father, Zebedee, in the boat with the hired servants, and
went after him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,21);</script>They went
into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath day he entered into the
synagogue and taught. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,22);</script>They were astonished at his
teaching, for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,23);</script>Immediately there was in
their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,24);</script>saying, “Ha! What do we have to
do with you, Jesus, you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know you
who you are: the Holy One of God!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,25);</script>Jesus rebuked him,
saying, <span class="j">“Be quiet, and come out of him!”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,26);</script>The unclean spirit,
convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,27);</script>They were all amazed, so that
they questioned among themselves, saying, “What is this? A new teaching?
For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey
him!” <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,28);</script>The report of him
went out immediately everywhere into all the region of Galilee and its
surrounding area.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,29);</script>Immediately, when they
had come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and
Andrew, with James and John. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,30);</script>Now Simon’s wife’s mother lay
sick with a fever, and immediately they told him about her. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,31);</script>He came and took her by the hand,
and raised her up. The fever left her, and she served them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,32);</script>At evening, when the sun had set,
they brought to him all who were sick, and those who were possessed by
demons. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,33);</script>All the city was
gathered together at the door. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,34);</script>He healed many who were sick with
various diseases, and cast out many demons. He didn’t allow the demons
to speak, because they knew him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,35);</script>Early in the morning,
while it was still dark, he rose up and went out, and departed into a
deserted place, and prayed there. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,36);</script>Simon and those who were with him
followed after him; <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,37);</script>and
they found him, and told him, “Everyone is looking for you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,38);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Let’s go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach
there also, because I came out for this reason.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,39);</script>He went into their synagogues
throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,40);</script>A leper came to him,
begging him, kneeling down to him, and saying to him, “If you want to,
you can make me clean.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,41);</script>Being moved with
compassion, he stretched out his hand, and touched him, and said to him,
<span class="j">“I want to. Be made clean.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,42);</script>When he had said this,
immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,43);</script>He strictly warned him, and
immediately sent him out, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,44);</script>and said to him, <span
class="j">“See you say nothing to anybody, but go show yourself to the
priest, and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for
a testimony to them.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,45);</script>But he went out, and
began to proclaim it much, and to spread about the matter, so that Jesus
could no more openly enter into a city, but was outside in desert places:
and they came to him from everywhere.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,1);</script>When he entered again
into Capernaum after some days, it was heard that he was in the house.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,2);</script>Immediately many were
gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even around the
door; and he spoke the word to them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,3);</script>Four people came, carrying a
paralytic to him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,4);</script>When
they could not come near to him for the crowd, they removed the roof where
he was. When they had broken it up, they let down the mat that the
paralytic was lying on. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,5);</script>Jesus, seeing their faith, said to
the paralytic, <span class="j">“Son, your sins are forgiven
you.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,6);</script>But there were some of
the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,7);</script>“Why does this man speak
blasphemies like that? Who can forgive sins but God alone?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,8);</script>Immediately Jesus,
perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, said to
them, <span class="j">“Why do you reason these things in your hearts?
<script type="text/javascript">cj(2,9);</script>Which is easier, to tell
the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven;’ or to say, ‘Arise, and take
up your bed, and walk?’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(2,10);</script>But that you may know that the
Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”</span>—he said to
the paralytic—<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,11);</script><span
class="j">“I tell you, arise, take up your mat, and go to your
house.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,12);</script>He arose, and
immediately took up the mat, and went out in front of them all; so that
they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, “We never saw anything
like this!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,13);</script>He went out again by
the seaside. All the multitude came to him, and he taught them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,14);</script>As he passed by, he saw Levi, the
son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, <span
class="j">“Follow me.”</span> And he arose and followed him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,15);</script>It happened, that he
was reclining at the table in his house, and many tax collectors and
sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many, and
they followed him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,16);</script>The
scribes and the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with the
sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, “Why is it that he
eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,17);</script>When Jesus heard it,
he said to them, <span class="j">“Those who are healthy have no need for
a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but
sinners to repentance.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,18);</script>John’s disciples and
the Pharisees were fasting, and they came and asked him, “Why do
John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your
disciples don’t fast?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,19);</script>Jesus said to them,
<span class="j">“Can the groomsmen fast while the bridegroom is with
them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they can’t fast.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(2,20);</script>But the days will come
when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then will they fast
in that day. <script type="text/javascript">cj(2,21);</script>No one sews
a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, or else the patch shrinks and
the new tears away from the old, and a worse hole is made. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(2,22);</script>No one puts new wine into old
wineskins, or else the new wine will burst the skins, and the wine pours
out, and the skins will be destroyed; but they put new wine into fresh
wineskins.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,23);</script>It happened that he
was going on the Sabbath day through the grain fields, and his disciples
began, as they went, to pluck the ears of grain. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,24);</script>The Pharisees said to him,
“Behold, why do they do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath day?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,25);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Did you never read what David did, when he had need, and was
hungry—he, and those who were with him? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(2,26);</script>How he entered into God’s house
when Abiathar was high priest, and ate the show bread, which is not lawful
to eat except for the priests, and gave also to those who were with
him?”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,27);</script>He said to
them, <span class="j">“The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the
Sabbath. <script type="text/javascript">cj(2,28);</script>Therefore the
Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,1);</script>He entered again into
the synagogue, and there was a man there who had his hand withered.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,2);</script>They watched him, whether
he would heal him on the Sabbath day, that they might accuse him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,3);</script>He said to the man who had his
hand withered, <span class="j">“Stand up.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,4);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Is it lawful on the Sabbath day to do good, or to do harm? To
save a life, or to kill?”</span> But they were silent. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,5);</script>When he had looked around at them
with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their hearts, he said to the
man, <span class="j">“Stretch out your hand.”</span> He stretched it
out, and his hand was restored as healthy as the other. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,6);</script>The Pharisees went out, and
immediately conspired with the Herodians against him, how they might
destroy him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,7);</script>Jesus withdrew to the
sea with his disciples, and a great multitude followed him from Galilee,
from Judea, <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,8);</script>from
Jerusalem, from Idumaea, beyond the Jordan, and those from around Tyre and
Sidon. A great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came to him.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,9);</script>He spoke to his disciples
that a little boat should stay near him because of the crowd, so that they
wouldn’t press on him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,10);</script>For he had healed many, so that
as many as had diseases pressed on him that they might touch him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,11);</script>The unclean spirits, whenever
they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, “You are the Son of
God!” <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,12);</script>He sternly warned
them that they should not make him known.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,13);</script>He went up into the
mountain, and called to himself those whom he wanted, and they went to
him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,14);</script>He appointed twelve,
that they might be with him, and that he might send them out to preach,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,15);</script>and to have authority to
heal sicknesses and to cast out demons: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,16);</script>Simon, to whom he gave the name
Peter; <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,17);</script>James the son of
Zebedee; John, the brother of James, and he surnamed them Boanerges, which
means, Sons of Thunder; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,18);</script>Andrew; Philip; Bartholomew;
Matthew; Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,19);</script>and Judas Iscariot, who
also betrayed him.
<p>He came into a house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,20);</script>The multitude came together
again, so that they could not so much as eat bread. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,21);</script>When his friends heard it, they
went out to seize him: for they said, “He is insane.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,22);</script>The scribes who came down from
Jerusalem said, “He has Beelzebul,” and, “By the prince of the
demons he casts out the demons.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,23);</script>He summoned them, and
said to them in parables, <span class="j">“How can Satan cast out Satan?
<script type="text/javascript">cj(3,24);</script>If a kingdom is divided
against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(3,25);</script>If a house is divided against
itself, that house cannot stand. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(3,26);</script>If Satan has risen up against
himself, and is divided, he can’t stand, but has an end. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(3,27);</script>But no one can enter into the
house of the strong man to plunder, unless he first binds the strong man;
and then he will plunder his house. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(3,28);</script>Most certainly I tell you, all
sins of the descendants of man will be forgiven, including their
blasphemies with which they may blaspheme; <script
type="text/javascript">cj(3,29);</script>but whoever may blaspheme against
the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal
sin”</span><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,30);</script>—because
they said, “He has an unclean spirit.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,31);</script>His mother and his
brothers came, and standing outside, they sent to him, calling him.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,32);</script>A multitude was sitting
around him, and they told him, “Behold, your mother, your brothers, and
<a href="#N5">your sisters</a> are outside looking for you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,33);</script>He answered them,
<span class="j">“Who are my mother and my brothers?”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,34);</script>Looking around at those who sat
around him, he said, <span class="j">“Behold, my mother and my brothers!
<script type="text/javascript">cj(3,35);</script>For whoever does the will
of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,1);</script>Again he began to teach
by the seaside. A great multitude was gathered to him, so that he entered
into a boat in the sea, and sat down. All the multitude were on the land
by the sea. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,2);</script>He taught them
many things in parables, and told them in his teaching, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,3);</script><span class="j">“Listen! Behold,
the farmer went out to sow, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(4,4);</script>and it happened, as he sowed, some
seed fell by the road, and the birds<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N6">*</a></sup></font> came and devoured it. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(4,5);</script>Others fell on the rocky ground,
where it had little soil, and immediately it sprang up, because it had no
depth of soil. <script type="text/javascript">cj(4,6);</script>When the
sun had risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered
away. <script type="text/javascript">cj(4,7);</script>Others fell among
the thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no
fruit. <script type="text/javascript">cj(4,8);</script>Others fell into
the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing. Some
brought forth thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times
as much.”</span><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,9);</script>He said,
<span class="j">“Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,10);</script>When he was alone,
those who were around him with the twelve asked him about the parables.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,11);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“To you is given the mystery of the Kingdom of God, but to
those who are outside, all things are done in parables, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(4,12);</script>that ‘seeing they may see, and
not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest perhaps
they should turn again, and their sins should be forgiven
them.’”</span><font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N7">*</a></sup></font>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,13);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Don’t you understand this parable? How will you understand
all of the parables? <script type="text/javascript">cj(4,14);</script>The
farmer sows the word. <script type="text/javascript">cj(4,15);</script>The
ones by the road are the ones where the word is sown; and when they have
heard, immediately Satan comes, and takes away the word which has been
sown in them. <script type="text/javascript">cj(4,16);</script>These in
the same way are those who are sown on the rocky places, who, when they
have heard the word, immediately receive it with joy. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(4,17);</script>They have no root in themselves,
but are short-lived. When oppression or persecution arises because of the
word, immediately they stumble. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(4,18);</script>Others are those who are sown
among the thorns. These are those who have heard the word, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(4,19);</script>and the cares of this age, and
the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in
choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(4,20);</script>Those which were sown on the good
ground are those who hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, some
thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,21);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Is the lamp brought to be put under a <a
href="#N8">basket</a> or under a bed? Isn’t it put on a stand? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(4,22);</script>For there is nothing hidden,
except that it should be made known; neither was anything made secret, but
that it should come to light. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(4,23);</script>If any man has ears to hear, let
him hear.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,24);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Take heed what you hear. With whatever measure you measure,
it will be measured to you, and more will be given to you who hear.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(4,25);</script>For whoever has, to him
will more be given, and he who doesn’t have, even that which he has will
be taken away from him.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,26);</script>He said, <span
class="j">“The Kingdom of God is as if a man should cast seed on the
earth, <script type="text/javascript">cj(4,27);</script>and should sleep
and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he
doesn’t know how. <script type="text/javascript">cj(4,28);</script>For
the earth bears fruit: first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain
in the ear. <script type="text/javascript">cj(4,29);</script>But when the
fruit is ripe, immediately he puts forth the sickle, because the harvest
has come.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,30);</script>He said, <span
class="j">“How will we liken the Kingdom of God? Or with what parable
will we illustrate it? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(4,31);</script>It’s like a grain of mustard
seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, though it is less than all the
seeds that are on the earth, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(4,32);</script>yet when it is sown, grows up,
and becomes greater than all the herbs, and puts out great branches, so
that the birds of the sky can lodge under its shadow.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,33);</script>With many such
parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,34);</script>Without a parable he didn’t
speak to them; but privately to his own disciples he explained everything.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,35);</script>On that day, when
evening had come, he said to them, <span class="j">“Let’s go over to
the other side.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,36);</script>Leaving the multitude, they took
him with them, even as he was, in the boat. Other small boats were also
with him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,37);</script>A big wind
storm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so much that the boat was
already filled. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,38);</script>He
himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion, and they woke him up, and
told him, “Teacher, don’t you care that we are dying?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,39);</script>He awoke, and rebuked
the wind, and said to the sea, <span class="j">“Peace! Be
still!”</span> The wind ceased, and there was a great calm. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,40);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Why are you so afraid? How is it that you have no
faith?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,41);</script>They were greatly
afraid, and said to one another, “Who then is this, that even the wind
and the sea obey him?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,1);</script>They came to the other
side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,2);</script>When he had come out of the boat,
immediately a man with an unclean spirit met him out of the tombs. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,3);</script>He lived in the tombs. Nobody
could bind him any more, not even with chains, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,4);</script>because he had been often bound
with fetters and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and
the fetters broken in pieces. Nobody had the strength to tame him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,5);</script>Always, night and day, in the
tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out, and cutting himself with
stones. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,6);</script>When he saw Jesus
from afar, he ran and bowed down to him, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,7);</script>and crying out with a loud voice,
he said, “What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High
God? I adjure you by God, don’t torment me.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,8);</script>For he said to him, <span
class="j">“Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,9);</script>He asked him, <span
class="j">“What is your name?”</span>
<p>He said to him, “My name is Legion, for we are many.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,10);</script>He begged him much that he would
not send them away out of the country. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,11);</script>Now on the mountainside there was
a great herd of pigs feeding. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,12);</script>All the demons begged him,
saying, “Send us into the pigs, that we may enter into them.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,13);</script>At once Jesus gave
them permission. The unclean spirits came out and entered into the pigs.
The herd of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea,
and they were drowned in the sea. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,14);</script>Those who fed them fled, and told
it in the city and in the country.
<p>The people came to see what it was that had happened. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,15);</script>They came to Jesus, and saw him
who had been possessed by demons sitting, clothed, and in his right mind,
even him who had the legion; and they were afraid. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,16);</script>Those who saw it declared to them
how it happened to him who was possessed by demons, and about the pigs.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(5,17);</script>They began to beg him to
depart from their region.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,18);</script>As he was entering
into the boat, he who had been possessed by demons begged him that he
might be with him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,19);</script>He
didn’t allow him, but said to him, <span class="j">“Go to your house,
to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for
you, and how he had mercy on you.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,20);</script>He went his way, and
began to proclaim in Decapolis how Jesus had done great things for him,
and everyone marveled.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,21);</script>When Jesus had crossed
back over in the boat to the other side, a great multitude was gathered to
him; and he was by the sea. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,22);</script>Behold, one of the rulers of the
synagogue, Jairus by name, came; and seeing him, he fell at his feet,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(5,23);</script>and begged him much,
saying, “My little daughter is at the point of death. Please come and
lay your hands on her, that she may be made healthy, and live.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,24);</script>He went with him, and
a great multitude followed him, and they pressed upon him on all sides.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(5,25);</script>A certain woman, who had
an issue of blood for twelve years, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,26);</script>and had suffered many things by
many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better, but
rather grew worse, <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,27);</script>having
heard the things concerning Jesus, came up behind him in the crowd, and
touched his clothes. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,28);</script>For
she said, “If I just touch his clothes, I will be made well.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,29);</script>Immediately the flow of her blood
was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her
affliction.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,30);</script>Immediately Jesus,
perceiving in himself that the power had gone out from him, turned around
in the crowd, and asked, <span class="j">“Who touched my
clothes?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,31);</script>His disciples said to
him, “You see the multitude pressing against you, and you say, ‘Who
touched me?’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,32);</script>He looked around to
see her who had done this thing. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,33);</script>But the woman, fearing and
trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before
him, and told him all the truth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,34);</script>He said to her, <span
class="j">“Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be
cured of your disease.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,35);</script>While he was still
speaking, people came from the synagogue ruler’s house saying, “Your
daughter is dead. Why bother the Teacher any more?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,36);</script>But Jesus, when he
heard the message spoken, immediately said to the ruler of the synagogue,
<span class="j">“Don’t be afraid, only believe.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,37);</script>He allowed no one to follow him,
except Peter, James, and John the brother of James. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,38);</script>He came to the synagogue
ruler’s house, and he saw an uproar, weeping, and great wailing. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,39);</script>When he had entered in, he said
to them, <span class="j">“Why do you make an uproar and weep? The child
is not dead, but is asleep.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,40);</script>They ridiculed him.
But he, having put them all out, took the father of the child, her mother,
and those who were with him, and went in where the child was lying.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(5,41);</script>Taking the child by the
hand, he said to her, <span class="j">“Talitha cumi!”</span> which
means, being interpreted, <span class="j">“Girl, I tell you, get
up!”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,42);</script>Immediately
the girl rose up and walked, for she was twelve years old. They were
amazed with great amazement. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,43);</script>He strictly ordered them that no
one should know this, and commanded that something should be given to her
to eat.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,1);</script>He went out from there.
He came into his own country, and his disciples followed him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,2);</script>When the Sabbath had come, he
began to teach in the synagogue, and many hearing him were astonished,
saying, “Where did this man get these things?” and, “What is the
wisdom that is given to this man, that such mighty works come about by his
hands? <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,3);</script>Isn’t this the
carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James, Joses, Judah, and Simon?
Aren’t his sisters here with us?” They were offended at him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,4);</script>Jesus said to them,
<span class="j">“A prophet is not without honor, except in his own
country, and among his own relatives, and in his own house.”</span>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(6,5);</script>He could do no mighty work
there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people, and healed
them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,6);</script>He marveled because
of their unbelief.
<p>He went around the villages teaching. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,7);</script>He called to himself the twelve,
and began to send them out two by two; and he gave them authority over the
unclean spirits. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,8);</script>He
commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, except a
staff only: no bread, no wallet, no money in their purse, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,9);</script>but to wear sandals, and not put
on two tunics. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,10);</script>He said to
them, <span class="j">“Wherever you enter into a house, stay there until
you depart from there. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(6,11);</script>Whoever will not receive you nor
hear you, as you depart from there, shake off the dust that is under your
feet for a testimony against them. Assuredly, I tell you, it will be more
tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that
city!”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,12);</script>They went out and
preached that people should repent. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,13);</script>They cast out many demons, and
anointed many with oil who were sick, and healed them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,14);</script>King Herod heard this, for his
name had become known, and he said, “John the Baptizer has risen from
the dead, and therefore these powers are at work in him.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,15);</script>But others said, “He is
Elijah.” Others said, “He is a prophet, or like one of the
prophets.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,16);</script>But Herod,
when he heard this, said, “This is John, whom I beheaded. He has risen
from the dead.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,17);</script>For
Herod himself had sent out and arrested John, and bound him in prison for
the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, for he had married her.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(6,18);</script>For John said to Herod,
“It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,19);</script>Herodias set herself against him,
and desired to kill him, but she couldn’t, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,20);</script>for Herod feared John, knowing
that he was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. When he heard
him, he did many things, and he heard him gladly.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,21);</script>Then a convenient day
came, that Herod on his birthday made a supper for his nobles, the high
officers, and the chief men of Galilee. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,22);</script>When the daughter of Herodias
herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod and those sitting with him.
The king said to the young lady, “Ask me whatever you want, and I will
give it to you.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,23);</script>He
swore to her, “Whatever you shall ask of me, I will give you, up to half
of my kingdom.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,24);</script>She went out, and said
to her mother, “What shall I ask?”
<p>She said, “The head of John the Baptizer.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,25);</script>She came in
immediately with haste to the king, and asked, “I want you to give me
right now the head of John the Baptizer on a platter.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,26);</script>The king was
exceedingly sorry, but for the sake of his oaths, and of his dinner
guests, he didn’t wish to refuse her. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,27);</script>Immediately the king sent out a
soldier of his guard, and commanded to bring John’s head, and he went
and beheaded him in the prison, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,28);</script>and brought his head on a
platter, and gave it to the young lady; and the young lady gave it to her
mother.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,29);</script>When his disciples
heard this, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,30);</script>The apostles gathered
themselves together to Jesus, and they told him all things, whatever they
had done, and whatever they had taught. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,31);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“You come apart into a deserted place, and rest
awhile.”</span> For there were many coming and going, and they had no
leisure so much as to eat. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,32);</script>They went away in the boat to a
deserted place by themselves. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,33);</script><a href="#N9">They</a> saw them
going, and many recognized him and ran there on foot from all the cities.
They arrived before them and came together to him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,34);</script>Jesus came out, saw a great
multitude, and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep
without a shepherd, and he began to teach them many things. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,35);</script>When it was late in the day, his
disciples came to him, and said, “This place is deserted, and it is late
in the day. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,36);</script>Send them
away, that they may go into the surrounding country and villages, and buy
themselves bread, for they have nothing to eat.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,37);</script>But he answered them,
<span class="j">“You give them something to eat.”</span>
<p>They asked him, “Shall we go and buy <a href="#N10">two hundred
denarii</a> worth of bread, and give them something to eat?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,38);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“How many loaves do you have? Go see.”</span>
<p>When they knew, they said, “Five, and two fish.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,39);</script>He commanded them that
everyone should sit down in groups on the green grass. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,40);</script>They sat down in ranks, by
hundreds and by fifties. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,41);</script>He took the five loaves and the
two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke the loaves, and
he gave to his disciples to set before them, and he divided the two fish
among them all. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,42);</script>They all
ate, and were filled. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,43);</script>They took up twelve baskets full
of broken pieces and also of the fish. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,44);</script>Those who ate the loaves
were<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N11">*</a></sup></font>
five thousand men.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,45);</script>Immediately he made
his disciples get into the boat, and to go ahead to the other side, to
Bethsaida, while he himself sent the multitude away. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,46);</script>After he had taken leave of them,
he went up the mountain to pray.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,47);</script>When evening had come,
the boat was in the midst of the sea, and he was alone on the land.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(6,48);</script>Seeing them distressed in
rowing, for the wind was contrary to them, about the fourth watch of the
night he came to them, walking on the sea,<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N12">*</a></sup></font> and he would have passed by
them, <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,49);</script>but they, when they
saw him walking on the sea, supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(6,50);</script>for they all saw him, and
were troubled. But he immediately spoke with them, and said to them, <span
class="j">“Cheer up! <a href="#N13">It is I!</a> Don’t be
afraid.”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,51);</script>He got
into the boat with them; and the wind ceased, and they were very amazed
among themselves, and marveled; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,52);</script>for they hadn’t understood
about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,53);</script>When they had crossed
over, they came to land at Gennesaret, and moored to the shore. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,54);</script>When they had come out of the
boat, immediately the people recognized him, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,55);</script>and ran around that whole region,
and began to bring those who were sick, on their mats, to where they heard
he was. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,56);</script>Wherever he
entered, into villages, or into cities, or into the country, they laid the
sick in the marketplaces, and begged him that they might touch just the <a
href="#N14">fringe</a> of his garment; and as many as touched him were
made well.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,1);</script>Then the Pharisees, and
some of the scribes gathered together to him, having come from Jerusalem.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,2);</script>Now when they saw some of
his disciples eating bread with defiled, that is, unwashed, hands, they
found fault. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,3);</script>(For the
Pharisees, and all the Jews, don’t eat unless they wash their hands and
forearms, holding to the tradition of the elders. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,4);</script>They don’t eat when they come
from the marketplace, unless they bathe themselves, and there are many
other things, which they have received to hold to: washings of cups,
pitchers, bronze vessels, and couches.) <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,5);</script>The Pharisees and the scribes
asked him, “Why don’t your disciples walk according to the tradition
of the elders, but eat their bread with unwashed hands?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,6);</script>He answered them, <span
class="j">“Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written,</span>
<dl><span class="j">
<dt>‘This people honors me with their lips,
<dd>but their heart is far from me.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cj(7,7);</script>But in vain do they
worship me,
<dd>teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N15">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(7,8);</script>“For you set aside the
commandment of God, and hold tightly to the tradition of men—the washing
of pitchers and cups, and you do many other such things.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,9);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Full well do you reject the commandment of God, that you may
keep your tradition. <script type="text/javascript">cj(7,10);</script>For
Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother;’<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N16">*</a></sup></font> and, ‘He who speaks evil
of father or mother, let him be put to death.’<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N17">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cj(7,11);</script>But you say, ‘If a man tells
his father or his mother, “Whatever profit you might have received from
me is <a href="#N18">Corban</a>, that is to say, given to God”;’
<script type="text/javascript">cj(7,12);</script>then you no longer allow
him to do anything for his father or his mother, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(7,13);</script>making void the word of God by
your tradition, which you have handed down. You do many things like
this.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,14);</script>He called all the
multitude to himself, and said to them, <span class="j">“Hear me, all of
you, and understand. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(7,15);</script>There is nothing from outside of
the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed
out of the man are those that defile the man. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(7,16);</script>If anyone has ears to hear, let
him hear!”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,17);</script>When he had entered
into a house away from the multitude, his disciples asked him about the
parable. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,18);</script>He said to them,
<span class="j">“Are you thus without understanding also? Don’t you
perceive that whatever goes into the man from outside can’t defile him,
<script type="text/javascript">cj(7,19);</script>because it doesn’t go
into his heart, but into his stomach, then into the latrine, thus <a
href="#N19">purifying all foods</a>?”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,20);</script>He said, <span class="j">“That
which proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(7,21);</script>For from within, out of the
hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual sins, murders,
thefts, <script type="text/javascript">cj(7,22);</script>covetings,
wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, and
foolishness. <script type="text/javascript">cj(7,23);</script>All these
evil things come from within, and defile the man.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,24);</script>From there he arose,
and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. He entered into a house,
and didn’t want anyone to know it, but he couldn’t escape notice.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,25);</script>For a woman, whose little
daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at
his feet. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,26);</script>Now the woman
was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast
the demon out of her daughter. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,27);</script>But Jesus said to her, <span
class="j">“Let the children be filled first, for it is not appropriate
to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,28);</script>But she answered him,
“Yes, Lord. Yet even the dogs under the table eat the children’s
crumbs.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,29);</script>He said to her, <span
class="j">“For this saying, go your way. The demon has gone out of your
daughter.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,30);</script>She went away to her
house, and found the child having been laid on the bed, with the demon
gone out.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,31);</script>Again he departed from
the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and came to the sea of Galilee, through the
midst of the region of Decapolis. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,32);</script>They brought to him one who was
deaf and had an impediment in his speech. They begged him to lay his hand
on him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,33);</script>He took him aside
from the multitude, privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he
spat, and touched his tongue. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,34);</script>Looking up to heaven, he sighed,
and said to him, <span class="j">“Ephphatha!”</span> that is, <span
class="j">“Be opened!”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,35);</script>Immediately his ears were opened,
and the impediment of his tongue was released, and he spoke clearly.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,36);</script>He commanded them that
they should tell no one, but the more he commanded them, so much the more
widely they proclaimed it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,37);</script>They were astonished beyond
measure, saying, “He has done all things well. He makes even the deaf
hear, and the mute speak!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,1);</script>In those days, when
there was a very great multitude, and they had nothing to eat, Jesus
called his disciples to himself, and said to them, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,2);</script><span class="j">“I have
compassion on the multitude, because they have stayed with me now three
days, and have nothing to eat. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,3);</script>If I send them away fasting to
their home, they will faint on the way, for some of them have come a long
way.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,4);</script>His disciples answered
him, “From where could one satisfy these people with bread here in a
deserted place?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,5);</script>He asked them, <span
class="j">“How many loaves do you have?”</span>
<p>They said, “Seven.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,6);</script>He commanded the
multitude to sit down on the ground, and he took the seven loaves. Having
given thanks, he broke them, and gave them to his disciples to serve, and
they served the multitude. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,7);</script>They had a few small fish. Having
blessed them, he said to serve these also. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,8);</script>They ate, and were filled. They
took up seven baskets of broken pieces that were left over. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,9);</script>Those who had eaten were about
four thousand. Then he sent them away.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,10);</script>Immediately he entered
into the boat with his disciples, and came into the region of Dalmanutha.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,11);</script>The Pharisees came out
and began to question him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, and
testing him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,12);</script>He sighed
deeply in his spirit, and said, <span class="j">“Why does this <a
href="#N20">generation</a> seek a sign? Most certainly I tell you, no sign
will be given to this generation.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,13);</script>He left them, and
again entering into the boat, departed to the other side. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,14);</script>They forgot to take bread; and
they didn’t have more than one loaf in the boat with them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,15);</script>He warned them, saying, <span
class="j">“Take heed: beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast
of Herod.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,16);</script>They reasoned with one
another, saying, “It’s because we have no bread.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,17);</script>Jesus, perceiving it,
said to them, <span class="j">“Why do you reason that it’s because you
have no bread? Don’t you perceive yet, neither understand? Is your heart
still hardened? <script type="text/javascript">cj(8,18);</script>Having
eyes, don’t you see? Having ears, don’t you hear? Don’t you
remember? <script type="text/javascript">cj(8,19);</script>When I broke
the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken
pieces did you take up?”</span>
<p>They told him, “Twelve.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,20);</script><span
class="j">“When the seven loaves fed the four thousand, how many baskets
full of broken pieces did you take up?”</span>
<p>They told him, “Seven.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,21);</script>He asked them, <span
class="j">“Don’t you understand, yet?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,22);</script>He came to Bethsaida.
They brought a blind man to him, and begged him to touch him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,23);</script>He took hold of the blind man by
the hand, and brought him out of the village. When he had spit on his
eyes, and laid his hands on him, he asked him if he saw anything.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,24);</script>He looked up, and
said, “I see men; for I see them like trees walking.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,25);</script>Then again he laid his
hands on his eyes. He looked intently, and was restored, and saw everyone
clearly. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,26);</script>He sent him away
to his house, saying, <span class="j">“Don’t enter into the village,
nor tell anyone in the village.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,27);</script>Jesus went out, with
his disciples, into the villages of Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked
his disciples, <span class="j">“Who do men say that I am?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,28);</script>They told him, “John
the Baptizer, and others say Elijah, but others: one of the prophets.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,29);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“But who do you say that I am?”</span>
<p>Peter answered, “You are the Christ.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,30);</script>He commanded them that
they should tell no one about him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,31);</script>He began to teach them that the
Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, the
chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise
again. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,32);</script>He spoke to them
openly. Peter took him, and began to rebuke him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,33);</script>But he, turning around, and
seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter, and said, <span class="j">“Get
behind me, Satan! For you have in mind not the things of God, but the
things of men.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,34);</script>He called the
multitude to himself with his disciples, and said to them, <span
class="j">“Whoever wants to come after me, let him deny himself, and
take up his cross, and follow me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,35);</script>For whoever wants to save his
life will lose it; and whoever will lose his life for my sake and the sake
of the Good News will save it. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,36);</script>For what does it profit a man, to
gain the whole world, and forfeit his life? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,37);</script>For what will a man give in
exchange for his life? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(8,38);</script>For whoever will be ashamed of me
and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man
also will be ashamed of him, when he comes in the glory of his Father with
the holy angels.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,1);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Most certainly I tell you, there are some standing here who
will in no way taste death until they see the Kingdom of God come with
power.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,2);</script>After six days Jesus
took with him Peter, James, and John, and brought them up onto a high
mountain privately by themselves, and he was changed into another form in
front of them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,3);</script>His
clothing became glistening, exceedingly white, like snow, such as no
launderer on earth can whiten them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,4);</script>Elijah and Moses appeared to them,
and they were talking with Jesus.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,5);</script>Peter answered Jesus,
“Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let’s make three tents: one for
you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,6);</script>For he didn’t know what to say,
for they were very afraid.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,7);</script>A cloud came,
overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud, “This is my
beloved Son. Listen to him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,8);</script>Suddenly looking
around, they saw no one with them any more, except Jesus only.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,9);</script>As they were coming
down from the mountain, he commanded them that they should tell no one
what things they had seen, until after the Son of Man had risen from the
dead. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,10);</script>They kept this
saying to themselves, questioning what the “rising from the dead”
meant.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,11);</script>They asked him,
saying, “Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,12);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Elijah indeed comes first, and restores all things. How is it
written about the Son of Man, that he should suffer many things and be
despised? <script type="text/javascript">cj(9,13);</script>But I tell you
that Elijah has come, and they have also done to him whatever they wanted
to, even as it is written about him.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,14);</script>Coming to the
disciples, he saw a great multitude around them, and scribes questioning
them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,15);</script>Immediately all the
multitude, when they saw him, were greatly amazed, and running to him
greeted him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,16);</script>He asked the
scribes, <span class="j">“What are you asking them?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,17);</script>One of the multitude
answered, “Teacher, I brought to you my son, who has a mute spirit;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,18);</script>and wherever it seizes
him, it throws him down, and he foams at the mouth, and grinds his teeth,
and wastes away. I asked your disciples to cast it out, and they weren’t
able.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,19);</script>He answered him, <span
class="j">“Unbelieving generation, how long shall I be with you? How
long shall I bear with you? Bring him to me.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,20);</script>They brought him to
him, and when he saw him, immediately the spirit convulsed him, and he
fell on the ground, wallowing and foaming at the mouth.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,21);</script>He asked his father,
<span class="j">“How long has it been since this has come to
him?”</span>
<p>He said, “From childhood. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,22);</script>Often it has cast him both into
the fire and into the water, to destroy him. But if you can do anything,
have compassion on us, and help us.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,23);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“If you can believe, all things are possible to him who
believes.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,24);</script>Immediately the father
of the child cried out with tears, “I believe. Help my unbelief!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,25);</script>When Jesus saw that a
multitude came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to
him, <span class="j">“You mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out
of him, and never enter him again!”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,26);</script>Having cried out, and
convulsed greatly, it came out of him. The boy became like one dead; so
much that most of them said, “He is dead.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,27);</script>But Jesus took him by the hand,
and raised him up; and he arose.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,28);</script>When he had come into
the house, his disciples asked him privately, “Why couldn’t we cast it
out?” <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,29);</script>He said to them,
<span class="j">“This kind can come out by nothing, except by prayer and
fasting.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,30);</script>They went out from
there, and passed through Galilee. He didn’t want anyone to know it.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,31);</script>For he was teaching his
disciples, and said to them, <span class="j">“The Son of Man is being
handed over to the hands of men, and they will kill him; and when he is
killed, on the third day he will rise again.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,32);</script>But they didn’t
understand the saying, and were afraid to ask him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,33);</script>He came to Capernaum,
and when he was in the house he asked them, <span class="j">“What were
you arguing among yourselves on the way?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,34);</script>But they were silent,
for they had disputed one with another on the way about who was the
greatest.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,35);</script>He sat down, and
called the twelve; and he said to them, <span class="j">“If any man
wants to be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all.”</span>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,36);</script>He took a little child,
and set him in their midst. Taking him in his arms, he said to them,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,37);</script><span
class="j">“Whoever receives one such little child in my name, receives
me, and whoever receives me, doesn’t receive me, but him who sent
me.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,38);</script>John said to him,
“Teacher, we saw someone who doesn’t follow us casting out demons in
your name; and we forbade him, because he doesn’t follow us.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,39);</script>But Jesus said, <span
class="j">“Don’t forbid him, for there is no one who will do a mighty
work in my name, and be able quickly to speak evil of me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(9,40);</script>For whoever is not against us is
on our side. <script type="text/javascript">cj(9,41);</script>For whoever
will give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because you are
Christ’s, most certainly I tell you, he will in no way lose his reward.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(9,42);</script>Whoever will cause one of
these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him
if he were thrown into the sea with a millstone hung around his neck.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(9,43);</script>If your hand causes you
to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed,
rather than having your two hands to go into <a href="#N21">Gehenna,</a>
into the unquenchable fire, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(9,44);</script>‘where their worm doesn’t
die, and the fire is not quenched.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(9,45);</script>If your foot causes you to
stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life lame, rather
than having your two feet to be cast into <a href="#N22">Gehenna,</a> into
the fire that will never be quenched—<script
type="text/javascript">cj(9,46);</script>‘where their worm doesn’t
die, and the fire is not quenched.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(9,47);</script>If your eye causes you to
stumble, cast it out. It is better for you to enter into the Kingdom of
God with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the <a
href="#N23">Gehenna</a> of fire, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(9,48);</script>‘where their worm doesn’t
die, and the fire is not quenched.’<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N24">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cj(9,49);</script>For everyone will be salted with
fire, and every sacrifice will be seasoned with salt. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(9,50);</script>Salt is good, but if the salt has
lost its saltiness, with what will you season it? Have salt in yourselves,
and be at peace with one another.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,1);</script>He arose from there
and came into the borders of Judea and beyond the Jordan. Multitudes came
together to him again. As he usually did, he was again teaching them.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(10,2);</script>Pharisees came to him
testing him, and asked him, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his
wife?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,3);</script>He answered, <span
class="j">“What did Moses command you?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,4);</script>They said, “Moses
allowed a certificate of divorce to be written, and to divorce her.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,5);</script>But Jesus said to
them, <span class="j">“For your hardness of heart, he wrote you this
commandment. <script type="text/javascript">cj(10,6);</script>But from the
beginning of the creation, God made them male and female.<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N25">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,7);</script>For this cause a man will leave
his father and mother, and will join to his wife, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,8);</script>and the two will become one
flesh,<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N26">*</a></sup></font>
so that they are no longer two, but one flesh. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,9);</script>What therefore God has joined
together, let no man separate.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,10);</script>In the house, his
disciples asked him again about the same matter. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,11);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Whoever divorces his wife, and marries another, commits
adultery against her. <script type="text/javascript">cj(10,12);</script>If
a woman herself divorces her husband, and marries another, she commits
adultery.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,13);</script>They were bringing to
him little children, that he should touch them, but the disciples rebuked
those who were bringing them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,14);</script>But when Jesus saw it, he was
moved with indignation, and said to them, <span class="j">“Allow the
little children to come to me! Don’t forbid them, for the Kingdom of God
belongs to such as these. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,15);</script>Most certainly I tell you,
whoever will not receive the Kingdom of God like a little child, he will
in no way enter into it.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,16);</script>He took them in his arms, and
blessed them, laying his hands on them.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,17);</script>As he was going out
into the way, one ran to him, knelt before him, and asked him, “Good
Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,18);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“Why do you call me good? No one is good except
one—God. <script type="text/javascript">cj(10,19);</script>You know the
commandments: ‘Do not murder,’ ‘Do not commit adultery,’ ‘Do not
steal,’ ‘Do not give false testimony,’ ‘Do not defraud,’
‘Honor your father and mother.’”</span><font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N27">*</a></sup></font>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,20);</script>He said to him,
“Teacher, I have observed all these things from my youth.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,21);</script>Jesus looking at him
loved him, and said to him, <span class="j">“One thing you lack. Go,
sell whatever you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure
in heaven; and come, follow me, taking up the cross.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,22);</script>But his face fell at
that saying, and he went away sorrowful, for he was one who had great
possessions. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,23);</script>Jesus
looked around, and said to his disciples, <span class="j">“How difficult
it is for those who have riches to enter into the Kingdom of God!”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,24);</script>The disciples were
amazed at his words. But Jesus answered again, <span
class="j">“Children, how hard is it for those who trust in riches to
enter into the Kingdom of God! <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,25);</script>It is easier for a camel to go
through a needle’s eye than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of
God.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,26);</script>They were exceedingly
astonished, saying to him, “Then who can be saved?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,27);</script>Jesus, looking at
them, said, <span class="j">“With men it is impossible, but not with
God, for all things are possible with God.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,28);</script>Peter began to tell
him, “Behold, we have left all, and have followed you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,29);</script>Jesus said, <span
class="j">“Most certainly I tell you, there is no one who has left
house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or
children, or land, for my sake, and for the sake of the Good News, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,30);</script>but he will receive one hundred
times more now in this time, houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children,
and land, with persecutions; and in the age to come eternal life. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,31);</script>But many who are first will be
last; and the last first.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,32);</script>They were on the way,
going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was going in front of them, and they were
amazed; and those who followed were afraid. He again took the twelve, and
began to tell them the things that were going to happen to him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,33);</script><span class="j">“Behold, we
are going up to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be delivered to the chief
priests and the scribes. They will condemn him to death, and will deliver
him to the Gentiles. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,34);</script>They will mock him, spit on him,
scourge him, and kill him. On the third day he will rise again.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,35);</script>James and John, the
sons of Zebedee, came near to him, saying, “Teacher, we want you to do
for us whatever we will ask.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,36);</script>He said to them,
<span class="j">“What do you want me to do for you?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,37);</script>They said to him,
“Grant to us that we may sit, one at your right hand, and one at your
left hand, in your glory.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,38);</script>But Jesus said to
them, <span class="j">“You don’t know what you are asking. Are you
able to drink the cup that I drink, and to be baptized with the baptism
that I am baptized with?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,39);</script>They said to him,
“We are able.”
<p>Jesus said to them, <span class="j">“You shall indeed drink the cup
that I drink, and you shall be baptized with the baptism that I am
baptized with; <script type="text/javascript">cj(10,40);</script>but to
sit at my right hand and at my left hand is not mine to give, but for whom
it has been prepared.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,41);</script>When the ten heard
it, they began to be indignant towards James and John.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,42);</script>Jesus summoned them,
and said to them, <span class="j">“You know that they who are recognized
as rulers over the nations lord it over them, and their great ones
exercise authority over them. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,43);</script>But it shall not be so among
you, but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(10,44);</script>Whoever of you wants to
become first among you, shall be bondservant of all. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(10,45);</script>For the Son of Man also came not
to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for
many.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,46);</script>They came to Jericho.
As he went out from Jericho, with his disciples and a great multitude, the
son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the road.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(10,47);</script>When he heard that it
was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out, and say, “Jesus, you son of
David, have mercy on me!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,48);</script>Many rebuked him, that he should
be quiet, but he cried out much more, “You son of David, have mercy on
me!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,49);</script>Jesus stood still,
and said, <span class="j">“Call him.”</span>
<p>They called the blind man, saying to him, “Cheer up! Get up. He is
calling you!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,50);</script>He, casting away his
cloak, sprang up, and came to Jesus.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,51);</script>Jesus asked him,
<span class="j">“What do you want me to do for you?”</span>
<p>The blind man said to him, “<a href="#N28">Rabboni,</a> that I may
see again.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,52);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“Go your way. Your faith has made you well.”</span>
Immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,1);</script>When they drew near to
Jerusalem, to <a href="#N29">Bethsphage</a> and Bethany, at the Mount of
Olives, he sent two of his disciples, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,2);</script>and said to them, <span
class="j">“Go your way into the village that is opposite you.
Immediately as you enter into it, you will find a young donkey tied, on
which no one has sat. Untie him, and bring him. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,3);</script>If anyone asks you, ‘Why are
you doing this?’ say, ‘The Lord needs him;’ and immediately he will
send him back here.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,4);</script>They went away, and
found a young donkey tied at the door outside in the open street, and they
untied him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,5);</script>Some of those
who stood there asked them, “What are you doing, untying the young
donkey?” <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,6);</script>They said to
them just as Jesus had said, and they let them go.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,7);</script>They brought the young
donkey to Jesus, and threw their garments on it, and Jesus sat on it.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,8);</script>Many spread their
garments on the way, and others were cutting down branches from the trees,
and spreading them on the road. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,9);</script>Those who went in front, and
those who followed, cried out, “<a href="#N30">Hosanna</a>! Blessed is

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,11);</script>Jesus entered into
the temple in Jerusalem. When he had looked around at everything, it being
now evening, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,12);</script>The next day, when
they had come out from Bethany, he was hungry. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,13);</script>Seeing a fig tree afar off
having leaves, he came to see if perhaps he might find anything on it.
When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season
for figs. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,14);</script>Jesus told it,
<span class="j">“May no one ever eat fruit from you again!”</span> and
his disciples heard it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,15);</script>They came to
Jerusalem, and Jesus entered into the temple, and began to throw out those
who sold and those who bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of
the money changers, and the seats of those who sold the doves. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,16);</script>He would not allow anyone to
carry a container through the temple. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,17);</script>He taught, saying to them, <span
class="j">“Isn’t it written, ‘My house will be called a house of
prayer for all the nations?’<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,18);</script>The chief priests and
the scribes heard it, and sought how they might destroy him. For they
feared him, because all the multitude was astonished at his teaching.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,19);</script>When evening came, he
went out of the city. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,20);</script>As
they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away from
the roots. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,21);</script>Peter,
remembering, said to him, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree which you cursed
has withered away.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,22);</script>Jesus answered them,
<span class="j">“Have faith in God. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,23);</script>For most certainly I tell you,
whoever may tell this mountain, ‘Be taken up and cast into the sea,’
and doesn’t doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says is
happening; he shall have whatever he says. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,24);</script>Therefore I tell you, all things
whatever you pray and ask for, believe that you have received them, and
you shall have them. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,25);</script>Whenever you stand praying,
forgive, if you have anything against anyone; so that your Father, who is
in heaven, may also forgive you your transgressions. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,26);</script>But if you do not forgive,
neither will your Father in heaven forgive your transgressions.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,27);</script>They came again to
Jerusalem, and as he was walking in the temple, the chief priests, and the
scribes, and the elders came to him, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,28);</script>and they began saying to him,
“By what authority do you do these things? Or who gave you this
authority to do these things?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,29);</script>Jesus said to them,
<span class="j">“I will ask you one question. Answer me, and I will tell
you by what authority I do these things. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,30);</script>The baptism of John—was it
from heaven, or from men? Answer me.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,31);</script>They reasoned with
themselves, saying, “If we should say, ‘From heaven;’ he will say,
‘Why then did you not believe him?’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,32);</script>If we should say, ‘From
men’”—they feared the people, for all held John to really be a
prophet. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,33);</script>They answered
Jesus, “We don’t know.”
<p>Jesus said to them, <span class="j">“Neither do I tell you by what
authority I do these things.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,1);</script>He began to speak to
them in parables. <span class="j">“A man planted a vineyard, put a hedge
around it, dug a pit for the winepress, built a tower, rented it out to a
farmer, and went into another country. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,2);</script>When it was time, he sent a
servant to the farmer to get from the farmer his share of the fruit of the
vineyard. <script type="text/javascript">cj(12,3);</script>They took him,
beat him, and sent him away empty. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,4);</script>Again, he sent another servant to
them; and they threw stones at him, wounded him in the head, and sent him
away shamefully treated. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,5);</script>Again he sent another; and they
killed him; and many others, beating some, and killing some. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,6);</script>Therefore still having one, his
beloved son, he sent him last to them, saying, ‘They will respect my
son.’ <script type="text/javascript">cj(12,7);</script>But those farmers
said among themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him, and
the inheritance will be ours.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,8);</script>They took him, killed him, and
cast him out of the vineyard. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,9);</script>What therefore will the lord of
the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the farmers, and will give the
vineyard to others. <script

Scripture:</span>

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,12);</script>They tried to seize
him, but they feared the multitude; for they perceived that he spoke the
parable against them. They left him, and went away. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,13);</script>They sent some of the Pharisees
and of the Herodians to him, that they might trap him with words. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,14);</script>When they had come, they asked
him, “Teacher, we know that you are honest, and don’t defer to anyone;
for you aren’t partial to anyone, but truly teach the way of God. Is it
lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,15);</script>Shall we give, or shall we not
give?”
<p>But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, <span class="j">“Why
do you test me? Bring me a denarius, that I may see it.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,16);</script>They brought it.
<p>He said to them, <span class="j">“Whose is this image and
inscription?”</span>
<p>They said to him, “Caesar’s.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,17);</script>Jesus answered them,
<span class="j">“Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to
God the things that are God’s.”</span>
<p>They marveled greatly at him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,18);</script>There came to him
Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection. They asked him, saying,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(12,19);</script>“Teacher, Moses wrote
to us, ‘If a man’s brother dies, and leaves a wife behind him, and
leaves no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up
offspring for his brother.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,20);</script>There were seven brothers. The
first took a wife, and dying left no offspring. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,21);</script>The second took her, and died,
leaving no children behind him. The third likewise; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,22);</script>and the seven took her and left
no children. Last of all the woman also died. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,23);</script>In the resurrection, when they
rise, whose wife will she be of them? For the seven had her as a wife.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,24);</script>Jesus answered them,
<span class="j">“Isn’t this because you are mistaken, not knowing the
Scriptures, nor the power of God? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,25);</script>For when they will rise from the
dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like angels
in heaven. <script type="text/javascript">cj(12,26);</script>But about the
dead, that they are raised; haven’t you read in the book of Moses, about
the Bush, how God spoke to him, saying, ‘I am the God of Abraham, the
God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N35">*</a></sup></font>? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,27);</script>He is not the God of the dead,
but of the living. You are therefore badly mistaken.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,28);</script>One of the scribes
came, and heard them questioning together. Knowing that he had answered
them well, asked him, “Which commandment is the greatest of all?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,29);</script>Jesus answered, <span
class="j">“The greatest is, ‘Hear, Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord
is one: <script type="text/javascript">cj(12,30);</script>you shall love
the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with
all your mind, and with all your strength.’<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N36">*</a></sup></font> This is the first
commandment. <script type="text/javascript">cj(12,31);</script>The second
is like this, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N37">*</a></sup></font> There is no
other commandment greater than these.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,32);</script>The scribe said to
him, “Truly, teacher, you have said well that he is one, and there is
none other but he, <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,33);</script>and
to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, with all
the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as himself,
is more important than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,34);</script>When Jesus saw that
he answered wisely, he said to him, <span class="j">“You are not far
from the Kingdom of God.”</span>
<p>No one dared ask him any question after that. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,35);</script>Jesus responded, as he taught in
the temple, <span class="j">“How is it that the scribes say that the
Christ is the son of David? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,36);</script>For David himself said in the
Holy Spirit,</span>
<dl><span class="j">

</dl>
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,37);</script>Therefore David himself calls
him Lord, so how can he be his son?”</span>
<p>The common people heard him gladly. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,38);</script>In his teaching he said to them,
<span class="j">“Beware of the scribes, who like to walk in long robes,
and to get greetings in the marketplaces, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,39);</script>and the best seats in the
synagogues, and the best places at feasts: <script
type="text/javascript">cj(12,40);</script>those who devour widows’
houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. These will receive greater
condemnation.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,41);</script>Jesus sat down
opposite the treasury, and saw how the multitude cast money into the
treasury. Many who were rich cast in much. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,42);</script>A poor widow came, and she cast
in two <a href="#N39">small brass coins,</a> which equal a <a
href="#N40">quadrans coin.</a> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,43);</script>He called his disciples to
himself, and said to them, <span class="j">“Most certainly I tell you,
this poor widow gave more than all those who are giving into the treasury,
<script type="text/javascript">cj(12,44);</script>for they all gave out of
their abundance, but she, out of her poverty, gave all that she had to
live on.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,1);</script>As he went out of the
temple, one of his disciples said to him, “Teacher, see what kind of
stones and what kind of buildings!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,2);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“Do you see these great buildings? There will not be
left here one stone on another, which will not be thrown down.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,3);</script>As he sat on the Mount
of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him
privately, <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,4);</script>“Tell us,
when will these things be? What is the sign that these things are all
about to be fulfilled?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,5);</script>Jesus, answering,
began to tell them, <span class="j">“Be careful that no one leads you
astray. <script type="text/javascript">cj(13,6);</script>For many will
come in my name, saying, ‘<a href="#N41">I am he!</a>’ and will lead
many astray.
</span><p><span class="j"><script

rumors of wars, don’t be troubled. For those must happen, but the end is
not yet. <script type="text/javascript">cj(13,8);</script>For nation will
rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be
earthquakes in various places. There will be famines and troubles. These
things are the beginning of birth pains. <script

will deliver you up to councils. You will be beaten in synagogues. You
will stand before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them.

be preached to all the nations. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,11);</script>When they lead you away and
deliver you up, don’t be anxious beforehand, or premeditate what you
will say, but say whatever will be given you in that hour. For it is not
you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.

had shortened the days, no flesh would have been saved; but for the sake

‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or, ‘Look, there!’ don’t believe it.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(13,22);</script>For there will arise

before the feast of the Passover and the unleavened bread, and the chief
priests and the scribes sought how they might seize him by deception, and
kill him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,2);</script>For they said,
“Not during the feast, because there might be a riot of the people.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,3);</script>While he was at
Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at the table, a woman
came having an alabaster jar of ointment of pure nard—very costly. She
broke the jar, and poured it over his head. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,4);</script>But there were some who were
indignant among themselves, saying, “Why has this ointment been wasted?
<script type="text/javascript">cb(14,5);</script>For this might have been
sold for more than <a href="#N45">three hundred denarii,</a> and given to
the poor.” They grumbled against her.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,6);</script>But Jesus said, <span

work for me. <script type="text/javascript">cj(14,7);</script>For you
always have the poor with you, and whenever you want to, you can do them
good; but you will not always have me. <script

has anointed my body beforehand for the burying. <script

which this woman has done will also be spoken of for a memorial of
her.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,10);</script>Judas Iscariot, who
was one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests, that he might
deliver him to them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,11);</script>They, when they heard it, were
glad, and promised to give him money. He sought how he might conveniently
deliver him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,12);</script>On the
first day of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the Passover, his
disciples asked him, “Where do you want us to go and prepare that you
may eat the Passover?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,13);</script>He sent two of his
disciples, and said to them, <span class="j">“Go into the city, and
there you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water. Follow him, <script

the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says, “Where is the guest room,
where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?”’ <script

upper room furnished and ready. Get ready for us there.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,16);</script>His disciples went
out, and came into the city, and found things as he had said to them, and
they prepared the Passover.

he came with the twelve. <script

Jesus said, <span class="j">“Most certainly I tell you, one of you will
betray me—he who eats with me.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,19);</script>They began to be
sorrowful, and to ask him one by one, “Surely not I?” And another
said, “Surely not I?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,20);</script>He answered them,
<span class="j">“It is one of the twelve, he who dips with me in the
dish. <script type="text/javascript">cj(14,21);</script>For the Son of Man
goes, even as it is written about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son

born.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,22);</script>As they were eating,
Jesus took bread, and when he had blessed, he broke it, and gave to them,
and said, <span class="j">“Take, eat. This is my body.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,23);</script>He took the cup, and
when he had given thanks, he gave to them. They all drank of it. <script

went out to the Mount of Olives.

him, “Although all will be offended, yet I will not.”

night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three
times.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,31);</script>But he spoke all the
more, “If I must die with you, I will not deny you.” They all said the
same thing.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,32);</script>They came to a place
which was named Gethsemane. He said to his disciples, <span

type="text/javascript">cb(14,33);</script>He took with him Peter, James,
and John, and began to be greatly troubled and distressed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,34);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here,
and watch.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,35);</script>He went forward a
little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the
hour might pass away from him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,36);</script>He said, <span
class="j">“Abba, Father, all things are possible to you. Please remove
this cup from me. However, not what I desire, but what you
desire.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,37);</script>He came and found
them sleeping, and said to Peter, <span class="j">“Simon, are you
sleeping? Couldn’t you watch one hour? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,38);</script>Watch and pray, that you may not
enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is
weak.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,39);</script>Again he went away,
and prayed, saying the same words. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,40);</script>Again he returned, and found
them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy, and they didn’t know what
to answer him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,41);</script>He came
the third time, and said to them, <span class="j">“Sleep on now, and
take your rest. It is enough. The hour has come. Behold, the Son of Man is
betrayed into the hands of sinners. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(14,42);</script>Arise, let us be going. Behold,
he who betrays me is at hand.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,43);</script>Immediately, while he
was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, came—and with him a
multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests, the scribes, and
the elders. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,44);</script>Now he who
betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, “Whomever I will kiss, that
is he. Seize him, and lead him away safely.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,45);</script>When he had come, immediately he
came to him, and said, “Rabbi! Rabbi!” and kissed him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,46);</script>They laid their hands on him,
and seized him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,47);</script>But a
certain one of those who stood by drew his sword, and struck the servant
of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,48);</script>Jesus answered them,
<span class="j">“Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and
clubs to seize me? <script type="text/javascript">cj(14,49);</script>I was
daily with you in the temple teaching, and you didn’t arrest me. But
this is so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,50);</script>They all left him,
and fled. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,51);</script>A certain
young man followed him, having a linen cloth thrown around himself, over
his naked body. The young men grabbed him, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,52);</script>but he left the linen cloth, and
fled from them naked. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,53);</script>They led Jesus away to the high
priest. All the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes came together
with him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,54);</script>Peter had followed
him from a distance, until he came into the court of the high priest. He
was sitting with the officers, and warming himself in the light of the
fire. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,55);</script>Now the chief
priests and the whole council sought witnesses against Jesus to put him to
death, and found none. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,56);</script>For many gave false testimony
against him, and their testimony didn’t agree with each other. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,57);</script>Some stood up, and gave false
testimony against him, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,58);</script>“We heard him say, ‘I will
destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will
build another made without hands.’” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,59);</script>Even so, their testimony did not
agree.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,60);</script>The high priest stood
up in the midst, and asked Jesus, “Have you no answer? What is it which
these testify against you?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,61);</script>But he stayed quiet, and
answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, “Are you the Christ,
the Son of the Blessed?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,62);</script>Jesus said, <span
class="j">“I am. You will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand
of Power, and coming with the clouds of the sky.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,63);</script>The high priest tore
his clothes, and said, “What further need have we of witnesses? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,64);</script>You have heard the blasphemy!
What do you think?” They all condemned him to be worthy of death.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(14,65);</script>Some began to spit on
him, and to cover his face, and to beat him with fists, and to tell him,
“Prophesy!” The officers struck him with the palms of their hands.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,66);</script>As Peter was in the
courtyard below, one of the maids of the high priest came, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,67);</script>and seeing Peter warming
himself, she looked at him, and said, “You were also with the Nazarene,
Jesus!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,68);</script>But he denied it,
saying, “I neither know, nor understand what you are saying.” He went
out on the porch, and the rooster crowed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,69);</script>The maid saw him, and
began again to tell those who stood by, “This is one of them.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,70);</script>But he again denied it. After a
little while again those who stood by said to Peter, “You truly are one
of them, for you are a Galilean, and your speech shows it.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,71);</script>But he began to curse, and to
swear, “I don’t know this man of whom you speak!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,72);</script>The rooster crowed the second
time. Peter remembered the word, how that Jesus said to him, <span
class="j">“Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three
times.”</span> When he thought about that, he wept.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,1);</script>Immediately in the
morning the chief priests, with the elders and scribes, and the whole
council, held a consultation, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and
delivered him up to Pilate. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,2);</script>Pilate asked him, “Are you the
King of the Jews?”
<p>He answered, <span class="j">“So you say.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,3);</script>The chief priests
accused him of many things. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,4);</script>Pilate again asked him, “Have
you no answer? See how many things they testify against you!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,5);</script>But Jesus made no
further answer, so that Pilate marveled.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,6);</script>Now at the feast he
used to release to them one prisoner, whom they asked of him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,7);</script>There was one called Barabbas,
bound with those who had made insurrection, men who in the insurrection
had committed murder. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,8);</script>The
multitude, crying aloud, began to ask him to do as he always did for them.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(15,9);</script>Pilate answered them,
saying, “Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(15,10);</script>For he perceived that
for envy the chief priests had delivered him up. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,11);</script>But the chief priests stirred up
the multitude, that he should release Barabbas to them instead. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,12);</script>Pilate again asked them, “What
then should I do to him whom you call the King of the Jews?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,13);</script>They cried out again,
“Crucify him!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,14);</script>Pilate said to them,
“Why, what evil has he done?”
<p>But they cried out exceedingly, “Crucify him!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,15);</script>Pilate, wishing to
please the multitude, released Barabbas to them, and handed over Jesus,
when he had flogged him, to be crucified. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,16);</script>The soldiers led him away within
the court, which is the Praetorium; and they called together the whole
cohort. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,17);</script>They clothed him
with purple, and weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,18);</script>They began to salute him,
“Hail, King of the Jews!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,19);</script>They struck his head with a
reed, and spat on him, and bowing their knees, did homage to him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,20);</script>When they had mocked him, they
took the purple off of him, and put his own garments on him. They led him
out to crucify him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,21);</script>They
compelled one passing by, coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene, the
father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them, that he might bear his
cross. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,22);</script>They brought him
to the place called Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, “The place of
a skull.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,23);</script>They offered
him wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but he didn’t take it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,24);</script>Crucifying him, they
parted his garments among them, casting lots on them, what each should
take. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,25);</script>It was <a
href="#N47">the third hour,</a> and they crucified him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,26);</script>The superscription of his
accusation was written over him, “THE KING OF THE JEWS.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,27);</script>With him they crucified two
robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,28);</script><a href="#N48">The Scripture was
fulfilled, which says, “He was numbered with transgressors.”</a>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,29);</script>Those who passed by
blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and saying, “Ha! You who destroy
the temple, and build it in three days, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,30);</script>save yourself, and come down
from the cross!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,31);</script>Likewise, also the
chief priests mocking among themselves with the scribes said, “He saved
others. He can’t save himself. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,32);</script>Let the Christ, the King of
Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe <a
href="#N49">him.</a>” Those who were crucified with him insulted him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,33);</script>When the <a
href="#N50">sixth hour</a> had come, there was darkness over the whole
land until the <a href="#N51">ninth hour.</a> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,34);</script>At the ninth hour Jesus cried
with a loud voice, saying, <span class="j">“Eloi, Eloi, lama
sabachthani?”</span> which is, being interpreted, <span class="j">“My
God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”</span><font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N52">*</a></sup></font>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,35);</script>Some of those who
stood by, when they heard it, said, “Behold, he is calling Elijah.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,36);</script>One ran, and filling
a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink,
saying, “Let him be. Let’s see whether Elijah comes to take him
down.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,37);</script>Jesus cried out with
a loud voice, and gave up the spirit. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,38);</script>The veil of the temple was torn
in two from the top to the bottom. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,39);</script>When the centurion, who stood by
opposite him, saw that he cried out like this and breathed his last, he
said, “Truly this man was the Son of God!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,40);</script>There were also women
watching from afar, among whom were both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the
mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,41);</script>who, when he was in Galilee,
followed him, and served him; and many other women who came up with him to
Jerusalem.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,42);</script>When evening had now
come, because it was the Preparation Day, that is, the day before the
Sabbath, <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,43);</script>Joseph of
Arimathaea, a prominent council member who also himself was looking for
the Kingdom of God, came. He boldly went in to Pilate, and asked for
Jesus’ body. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,44);</script>Pilate
marveled if he were already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked
him whether he had been dead long. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,45);</script>When he found out from the
centurion, he granted the body to Joseph. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,46);</script>He bought a linen cloth, and
taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb
which had been cut out of a rock. He rolled a stone against the door of
the tomb. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,47);</script>Mary Magdalene
and Mary, the mother of Joses, saw where he was laid.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,1);</script>When the Sabbath was
past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought
spices, that they might come and anoint him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,2);</script>Very early on the first day of
the week, they came to the tomb when the sun had risen. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,3);</script>They were saying among
themselves, “Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for
us?” <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,4);</script>for it was very
big. Looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled back.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,5);</script>Entering into the
tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white
robe, and they were amazed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,6);</script>He said to them, “Don’t be
amazed. You seek Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He has
risen. He is not here. Behold, the place where they laid him! <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,7);</script>But go, tell his disciples and
Peter, ‘He goes before you into Galilee. There you will see him, as he
said to you.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,8);</script>They went out,<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N53">*</a></sup></font> and fled
from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had come on them. They said
nothing to anyone; for they were afraid. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,9);</script>Now when he had risen early on
the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom
he had cast out seven demons. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,10);</script>She went and told those who had
been with him, as they mourned and wept. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,11);</script>When they heard that he was
alive, and had been seen by her, they disbelieved. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,12);</script>After these things he was
revealed in another form to two of them, as they walked, on their way into
the country. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,13);</script>They went
away and told it to the rest. They didn’t believe them, either.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,14);</script>Afterward he was
revealed to the eleven themselves as they sat at the table, and he rebuked
them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they didn’t
believe those who had seen him after he had risen. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,15);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Go into all the world, and preach the Good News to the whole
creation. <script type="text/javascript">cj(16,16);</script>He who
believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who disbelieves will be
condemned. <script type="text/javascript">cj(16,17);</script>These signs
will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons;
they will speak with new languages; <script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,18);</script>they will take up serpents; and
if they drink any deadly thing, it will in no way hurt them; they will lay
hands on the sick, and they will recover.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,19);</script>So then the Lord<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N54">*</a></sup></font>, after he
had spoken to them, was received up into heaven, and sat down at the right
hand of God. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,20);</script>They went
out, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming
the word by the signs that followed. Amen.
