The Good News According to Matthew
</h1><p>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,1);</script>The book of the genealogy
of Jesus <a href="#N1">Christ</a>, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,2);</script>Abraham became the father
of Isaac. Isaac became the father of Jacob. Jacob became the father of
Judah and his brothers. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,3);</script>Judah became the father of Perez
and Zerah by Tamar. Perez became the father of Hezron. Hezron became the
father of Ram. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,4);</script>Ram became
the father of Amminadab. Amminadab became the father of Nahshon. Nahshon
became the father of Salmon. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,5);</script>Salmon became the father of Boaz
by Rahab. Boaz became the father of Obed by Ruth. Obed became the father
of Jesse. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,6);</script>Jesse became the
father of King David. David became the father of Solomon by her who had
been the wife of Uriah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,7);</script>Solomon became the father of
Rehoboam. Rehoboam became the father of Abijah. Abijah became the father
of Asa. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,8);</script>Asa became the
father of Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat became the father of Joram. Joram
became the father of Uzziah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,9);</script>Uzziah became the father of
Jotham. Jotham became the father of Ahaz. Ahaz became the father of
Hezekiah. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,10);</script>Hezekiah became
the father of Manasseh. Manasseh became the father of Amon. Amon became
the father of Josiah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,11);</script>Josiah became the father of
Jechoniah and his brothers, at the time of the exile to Babylon. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,12);</script>After the exile to Babylon,
Jechoniah became the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel became the father of
Zerubbabel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,13);</script>Zerubbabel
became the father of Abiud. Abiud became the father of Eliakim. Eliakim
became the father of Azor. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,14);</script>Azor became the father of Sadoc.
Sadoc became the father of Achim. Achim became the father of Eliud.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,15);</script>Eliud became the father
of Eleazar. Eleazar became the father of Matthan. Matthan became the
father of Jacob. <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,16);</script>Jacob
became the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, from whom was born <a
href="#N2">Jesus</a>, who is called Christ. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,17);</script>So all the generations from
Abraham to David are fourteen generations; from David to the exile to
Babylon fourteen generations; and from the carrying away to Babylon to the
Christ, fourteen generations.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,18);</script>Now the birth of Jesus
Christ was like this; for after his mother, Mary, was engaged to Joseph,
before they came together, she was found pregnant by the Holy Spirit.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,19);</script>Joseph, her husband,
being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example,
intended to put her away secretly. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,20);</script>But when he thought about these
things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying,
“Joseph, son of David, don’t be afraid to take to yourself Mary, your
wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,21);</script>She shall bring forth a son. You
shall call his name Jesus, for it is he who shall save his people from
their sins.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,22);</script>Now all this has
happened, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through
the prophet, saying,
<dl>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,23);</script>“Behold, the virgin
shall be with child,
<dd>and shall bring forth a son.
<dt>They shall call his name Immanuel”;
<dd>which is, being interpreted, “God with us.”<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N3">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,24);</script>Joseph arose from his
sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took his wife
to himself; <script type="text/javascript">cb(1,25);</script>and didn’t
know her sexually until she had brought forth her firstborn son. He named
him Jesus.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,1);</script>Now when Jesus was born
in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of King Herod, behold, <a
href="#N4">wise men</a> from the east came to Jerusalem, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,2);</script>“Where is he who is born King of
the Jews? For we saw his star in the east, and have come to worship
him.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,3);</script>When King Herod
heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,4);</script>Gathering together all the chief
priests and scribes of the people, he asked them where the Christ would be
born. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,5);</script>They said to him,
“In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is written through the prophet, 
<dl>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,6);</script>‘You Bethlehem, land
of Judah,
<dd>are in no way least among the princes of Judah:
<dt>for out of you shall come forth a governor,
<dd>who shall shepherd my people, Israel.’”<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N5">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,7);</script>Then Herod secretly
called the wise men, and learned from them exactly what time the star
appeared. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,8);</script>He sent them to
Bethlehem, and said, “Go and search diligently for the young child. When
you have found him, bring me word, so that I also may come and worship
him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,9);</script>They, having heard the
king, went their way; and behold, the star, which they saw in the east,
went before them, until it came and stood over where the young child was.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,10);</script>When they saw the star,
they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,11);</script>They came into the house and saw
the young child with Mary, his mother, and they fell down and worshiped
him. Opening their treasures, they offered to him gifts: gold,
frankincense, and myrrh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,12);</script>Being warned in a dream that they
shouldn’t return to Herod, they went back to their own country another
way.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,13);</script>Now when they had
departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream,
saying, “Arise and take the young child and his mother, and flee into
Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, for Herod will seek the young
child to destroy him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,14);</script>He arose and took the
young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,15);</script>and was there until the death of
Herod; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the
prophet, saying, “Out of Egypt I called my son.”<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N6">*</a></sup></font>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,16);</script>Then Herod, when he
saw that he was mocked by the wise men, was exceedingly angry, and sent
out, and killed all the male children who were in Bethlehem and in all the
surrounding countryside, from two years old and under, according to the
exact time which he had learned from the wise men. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,17);</script>Then that which was spoken by
Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying,
<dl>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,18);</script>“A voice was heard
in Ramah,
<dd>lamentation, weeping and great mourning,
<dt>Rachel weeping for her children;
<dd>she wouldn’t be comforted,
<dd>because they are no more.”<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N7">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,19);</script>But when Herod was
dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,20);</script>“Arise and take
the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel, for those
who sought the young child’s life are dead.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,21);</script>He arose and took the
young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,22);</script>But when he heard that Archelaus
was reigning over Judea in the place of his father, Herod, he was afraid
to go there. Being warned in a dream, he withdrew into the region of
Galilee, <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,23);</script>and came and
lived in a city called Nazareth; that it might be fulfilled which was
spoken through the prophets: “He will be called a Nazarene.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,1);</script>In those days, John the
Baptizer came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,2);</script>“Repent, for the Kingdom of
Heaven is at hand!” <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,3);</script>For
this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet, saying,
<dl>
<dt>“The voice of one crying in the wilderness,
<dd>make ready the way of the Lord.
<dd>Make his paths straight.”<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N8">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,4);</script>Now John himself wore
clothing made of camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist. His
food was locusts and wild honey. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,5);</script>Then people from Jerusalem, all of
Judea, and all the region around the Jordan went out to him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,6);</script>They were <a
href="#N9">baptized</a> by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,7);</script>But when he saw many of
the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for his <a href="#N10">baptism,</a> he
said to them, “You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the
wrath to come? <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,8);</script>Therefore
bring forth fruit worthy of repentance! <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,9);</script>Don’t think to yourselves, ‘We
have Abraham for our father,’ for I tell you that God is able to raise
up children to Abraham from these stones.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,10);</script>“Even now the axe
lies at the root of the trees. Therefore every tree that doesn’t bring
forth good fruit is cut down, and cast into the fire. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,11);</script>I indeed <a
href="#N11">baptize</a> you in water for repentance, but he who comes
after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to carry. He will
baptize you in the Holy Spirit.<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N12">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,12);</script>His winnowing fork is in his
hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor. He will gather
his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable
fire.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,13);</script>Then Jesus came from
Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,14);</script>But John would have hindered him,
saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and you come to me?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,15);</script>But Jesus, answering,
said to him, <span class="j">“Allow it now, for this is the fitting way
for us to fulfill all righteousness.”</span> Then he allowed him.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,16);</script>Jesus, when he was
baptized, went up directly from the water: and behold, the heavens were
opened to him. He saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming
on him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,17);</script>Behold, a voice
out of the heavens said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well
pleased.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,1);</script>Then Jesus was led up
by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,2);</script>When he had fasted forty days and
forty nights, he was hungry afterward. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,3);</script>The tempter came and said to him,
“If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,4);</script>But he answered, <span
class="j">“It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by
every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.’”</span><font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N13">*</a></sup></font>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,5);</script>Then the devil took him
into the holy city. He set him on the pinnacle of the temple, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,6);</script>and said to him, “If you are the
Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, ‘He will put his
angels in charge of you.’ and,
<dl>
<dt>‘On their hands they will bear you up,
<dd>so that you don’t dash your foot against a stone.’”<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N14">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,7);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“Again, it is written, ‘You shall not test the Lord,
your God.’”</span><font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N15">*</a></sup></font>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,8);</script>Again, the devil took
him to an exceedingly high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of
the world, and their glory. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,9);</script>He said to him, “I will give you
all of these things, if you will fall down and worship me.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,10);</script>Then Jesus said to
him, <span class="j">“<a href="#N16">Get behind me,</a> Satan! For it is
written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and you shall serve him
only.’”</span><font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N17">*</a></sup></font>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,11);</script>Then the devil left
him, and behold, angels came and served him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,12);</script>Now when Jesus heard that John
was delivered up, he withdrew into Galilee. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,13);</script>Leaving Nazareth, he came and
lived in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and
Naphtali, <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,14);</script>that it might
be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,
<dl>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,15);</script>“The land of
Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,
<dd>toward the sea, beyond the Jordan,
<dd>Galilee of the Gentiles,
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,16);</script>the people who sat in
darkness saw a great light,
<dd>to those who sat in the region and shadow of death,
<dd>to them light has dawned.”<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N18">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,17);</script>From that time, Jesus
began to preach, and to say, <span class="j">“Repent! For the Kingdom of
Heaven is at hand.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,18);</script>Walking by the sea of
Galilee, <a href="#N19">he</a> saw two brothers: Simon, who is called
Peter, and Andrew, his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were
fishermen. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,19);</script>He said to
them, <span class="j">“Come after me, and I will make you fishers for
men.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,20);</script>They immediately left
their nets and followed him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,21);</script>Going on from there, he saw two
other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the
boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. He called them.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,22);</script>They immediately left the
boat and their father, and followed him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,23);</script>Jesus went about in
all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the Good News of the
Kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,24);</script>The report about him went
out into all Syria. They brought to him all who were sick, afflicted with
various diseases and torments, possessed with demons, epileptics, and
paralytics; and he healed them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,25);</script>Great multitudes from Galilee,
Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea and from beyond the Jordan followed him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,1);</script>Seeing the multitudes,
he went up onto the mountain. When he had sat down, his disciples came to
him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,2);</script>He opened his mouth
and taught them, saying,
<dl>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,3);</script><span

reproach you, persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you
falsely, for my sake. <script

prophets who were before you.

then good for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under the feet of

the world. A city located on a hill can’t be hidden. <script

are in the house. <script type="text/javascript">cj(5,16);</script>Even
so, let your light shine before men; that they may see your good works,

certainly, I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not even one <a

accomplished. <script type="text/javascript">cj(5,19);</script>Whoever,

all: neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God; <script

to you as well. <script type="text/javascript">cj(6,34);</script>Therefore

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,28);</script>It happened, when

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,1);</script>When he came down from

type="text/javascript">cb(8,2);</script>Behold, a leper came to him and
worshiped him, saying, “Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,3);</script>Jesus stretched out his
hand, and touched him, saying, <span class="j">“I want to. Be made
clean.”</span> Immediately his leprosy was cleansed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,4);</script>Jesus said to him, <span

priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to
them.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,5);</script>When he came into
Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking him, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,6);</script>and saying, “Lord, my servant
lies in the house paralyzed, grievously tormented.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,7);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“I will come and heal him.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,8);</script>The centurion answered,
“Lord, I’m not worthy for you to come under my roof. Just say the
word, and my servant will be healed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,9);</script>For I am also a man under
authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he
goes; and tell another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and tell my servant,

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,10);</script>When Jesus heard it,
he marveled, and said to those who followed, <span class="j">“Most
certainly I tell you, I haven’t found so great a faith, not even in
Israel. <script type="text/javascript">cj(8,11);</script>I tell you that
many will come from the east and the west, and will sit down with Abraham,

will be thrown out into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and

type="text/javascript">cb(8,13);</script>Jesus said to the centurion,
<span class="j">“Go your way. Let it be done for you as you have
believed.”</span> His servant was healed in that hour.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,14);</script>When Jesus came into
Peter’s house, he saw his wife’s mother lying sick with a fever.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,15);</script>He touched her hand, and
the fever left her. She got up and served <a href="#N42">him.</a> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,16);</script>When evening came, they brought
to him many possessed with demons. He cast out the spirits with a word,
and healed all who were sick; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,17);</script>that it might be fulfilled which
was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying: “He took our infirmities,
and bore our diseases.”<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a

type="text/javascript">cb(8,18);</script>Now when Jesus saw great

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,19);</script>A scribe came, and
said to him, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,20);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have
nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,21);</script>Another of his
disciples said to him, “Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,22);</script>But Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own
dead.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,23);</script>When he got into a
boat, his disciples followed him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,24);</script>Behold, a violent storm came up
on the sea, so much that the boat was covered with the waves, but he was
asleep. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,25);</script>They came to him,
and woke him up, saying, “Save us, Lord! We are dying!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,26);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Why are you fearful, O you of little faith?”</span> Then he
got up, rebuked the wind and the sea, and there was a great calm.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,27);</script>The men marveled,
saying, “What kind of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey
him?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,28);</script>When he came to the
other side, into the country of the <a href="#N44">Gergesenes,</a> two
people possessed by demons met him there, coming out of the tombs,
exceedingly fierce, so that nobody could pass that way. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,29);</script>Behold, they cried out, saying,
“What do we have to do with you, Jesus, Son of God? Have you come here
to torment us before the time?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,30);</script>Now there was a herd of many pigs
feeding far away from them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,31);</script>The demons begged him, saying,
“If you cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of pigs.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,32);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Go!”</span>
<p>They came out, and went into the herd of pigs: and behold, the whole
herd of pigs rushed down the cliff into the sea, and died in the water.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,33);</script>Those who fed them fled,
and went away into the city, and told everything, including what happened
to those who were possessed with demons. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,34);</script>Behold, all the city came out to
meet Jesus. When they saw him, they begged that he would depart from their
borders.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,1);</script>He entered into a boat,
and crossed over, and came into his own city. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,2);</script>Behold, they brought to him a man
who was paralyzed, lying on a bed. Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the
paralytic, <span class="j">“Son, cheer up! Your sins are forgiven
you.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,3);</script>Behold, some of the
scribes said to themselves, “This man blasphemes.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,4);</script>Jesus, knowing their
thoughts, said, <span class="j">“Why do you think evil in your hearts?
<script type="text/javascript">cj(9,5);</script>For which is easier, to
say, ‘Your sins are forgiven;’ or to say, ‘Get up, and walk?’
<script type="text/javascript">cj(9,6);</script>But that you may know that
the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins...”</span> (then
he said to the paralytic), <span class="j">“Get up, and take up your
mat, and go up to your house.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,7);</script>He arose and departed
to his house. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,8);</script>But when the
multitudes saw it, they marveled and glorified God, who had given such
authority to men.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,9);</script>As Jesus passed by from
there, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax collection office.
He said to him, <span class="j">“Follow me.”</span> He got up and
followed him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,10);</script>It happened
as he sat in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and
sat down with Jesus and his disciples. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,11);</script>When the Pharisees saw it, they
said to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors
and sinners?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,12);</script>When Jesus heard it,
he said to them, <span class="j">“Those who are healthy have no need for
a physician, but those who are sick do. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(9,13);</script>But you go and learn what this
means: ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,’<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N45">*</a></sup></font> for I came not to call the
righteous, but sinners <a href="#N46">to repentance.</a>”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,14);</script>Then John’s
disciples came to him, saying, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast often,
but your disciples don’t fast?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,15);</script>Jesus said to them,
<span class="j">“Can the friends of the bridegroom mourn, as long as the
bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will
be taken away from them, and then they will fast. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(9,16);</script>No one puts a piece of unshrunk
cloth on an old garment; for the patch would tear away from the garment,
and a worse hole is made. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(9,17);</script>Neither do people put new wine
into old wineskins, or else the skins would burst, and the wine be
spilled, and the skins ruined. No, they put new wine into fresh wineskins,
and both are preserved.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,18);</script>While he told these
things to them, behold, a ruler came and worshiped him, saying, “My
daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her, and she will
live.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,19);</script>Jesus got up and
followed him, as did his disciples. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,20);</script>Behold, a woman who had an issue
of blood for twelve years came behind him, and touched the <a
href="#N47">fringe</a> of his garment; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,21);</script>for she said within herself,
“If I just touch his garment, I will be made well.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,22);</script>But Jesus, turning
around and seeing her, said, <span class="j">“Daughter, cheer up! Your
faith has made you well.”</span> And the woman was made well from that
hour.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,23);</script>When Jesus came into
the ruler’s house, and saw the flute players, and the crowd in noisy
disorder, <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,24);</script>he said to
them, <span class="j">“Make room, because the girl isn’t dead, but
sleeping.”</span>
<p>They were ridiculing him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,25);</script>But when the crowd was put out,
he entered in, took her by the hand, and the girl arose. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,26);</script>The report of this went out into
all that land. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,27);</script>As Jesus
passed by from there, two blind men followed him, calling out and saying,
“Have mercy on us, son of David!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,28);</script>When he had come into
the house, the blind men came to him. Jesus said to them, <span
class="j">“Do you believe that I am able to do this?”</span>
<p>They told him, “Yes, Lord.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,29);</script>Then he touched their
eyes, saying, <span class="j">“According to your faith be it done to
you.”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,30);</script>Their eyes
were opened. Jesus strictly commanded them, saying, <span class="j">“See
that no one knows about this.”</span> <script

abroad his fame in all that land.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,32);</script>As they went out,
behold, a mute man who was demon possessed was brought to him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,33);</script>When the demon was cast out, the
mute man spoke. The multitudes marveled, saying, “Nothing like this has
ever been seen in Israel!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,34);</script>But the Pharisees
said, “By the prince of the demons, he casts out demons.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,35);</script>Jesus went about all
the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching
the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness

when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion for them, because
they were <a href="#N48">harassed</a> and scattered, like sheep without a
shepherd. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,37);</script>Then he said to
his disciples, <span class="j">“The harvest indeed is plentiful, but the
laborers are few. <script type="text/javascript">cj(9,38);</script>Pray
therefore that the Lord of the harvest will send out laborers into his
harvest.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,1);</script>He called to himself
his twelve disciples, and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to
cast them out, and to heal every disease and every sickness. <script

apostles are these. The first, Simon, who is called Peter; Andrew, his

Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus; <a

Iscariot, who also betrayed him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,5);</script>Jesus sent these
twelve out, and commanded them, saying, <span class="j">“Don’t go
among the Gentiles, and don’t enter into any city of the Samaritans.

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,1);</script>It happened that when
Jesus had finished directing his twelve disciples, he departed from there
to teach and preach in their cities. <script

the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples <script

who comes, or should we look for another?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,4);</script>Jesus answered them,
<span class="j">“Go and tell John the things which you hear and see:

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,7);</script>As these went their

you go out to see? A man in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft
clothing are in king’s houses. <script

prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet. <script

</span><p><span class="j"><script

this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces, who call
to their companions <script type="text/javascript">cj(11,17);</script>and
say, ‘We played the flute for you, and you didn’t dance. We mourned
for you, and you didn’t lament.’ <script

drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon.’ <script

friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ But wisdom is justified by her <a

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,20);</script>Then he began to
denounce the cities in which most of his mighty works had been done,
because they didn’t repent. <script

Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in

more tolerable for the land of Sodom, on the day of judgment, than for
you.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,25);</script>At that time, Jesus
answered, <span class="j">“I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and
earth, that you hid these things from the wise and understanding, and
revealed them to infants. <script

well-pleasing in your sight. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(11,27);</script>All things have been delivered

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,1);</script>At that time, Jesus
went on the Sabbath day through the grain fields. His disciples were
hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat. <script

it, said to him, “Behold, your disciples do what is not lawful to do on
the Sabbath.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,3);</script>But he said to them,
<span class="j">“Haven’t you read what David did, when he was hungry,
and those who were with him; <script

tell you that one greater than the temple is here. <script

type="text/javascript">cj(12,8);</script>For the Son of Man is Lord of the

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,9);</script>He departed there, and
went into their synagogue. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,10);</script>And behold there was a man with
a withered hand. They asked him, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath
day?” that they might accuse him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,11);</script>He said to them,
<span class="j">“What man is there among you, who has one sheep, and if
this one falls into a pit on the Sabbath day, won’t he grab on to it,
and lift it out? <script type="text/javascript">cj(12,12);</script>Of how
much more value then is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do
good on the Sabbath day.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,13);</script>Then he told the man, <span
class="j">“Stretch out your hand.”</span> He stretched it out; and it
was restored whole, just like the other. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,14);</script>But the Pharisees went out, and
conspired against him, how they might destroy him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,15);</script>Jesus, perceiving that, withdrew
from there. Great multitudes followed him; and he healed them all, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,16);</script>and commanded them that they
should not make him known: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,17);</script>that it might be fulfilled which
was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,22);</script>Then one possessed by
a demon, blind and mute, was brought to him and he healed him, so that the
blind and mute man both spoke and saw. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,23);</script>All the multitudes were amazed,
and said, “Can this be the son of David?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,24);</script>But when the Pharisees heard it,
they said, “This man does not cast out demons, except by Beelzebul, the
prince of the demons.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,25);</script>Knowing their
thoughts, Jesus said to them, <span class="j">“Every kingdom divided

he says, ‘I will return into my house from which I came out,’ and when

rocky ground, where they didn’t have much soil, and immediately they
sprang up, because they had no depth of earth. <script

see, and didn’t see them; and to hear the things which you hear, and
didn’t hear them.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,18);</script>“Hear, then, the parable of
the farmer. <script type="text/javascript">cj(13,19);</script>When anyone
hears the word of the Kingdom, and doesn’t understand it, the evil one
comes, and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart. This is
what was sown by the roadside. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,20);</script>What was sown on the rocky
places, this is he who hears the word, and immediately with joy receives
it; <script type="text/javascript">cj(13,21);</script>yet he has no root
in himself, but endures for a while. When oppression or persecution arises
because of the word, immediately he stumbles. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,22);</script>What was sown among the thorns,
this is he who hears the word, but the cares of this age and the
deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,23);</script>What was sown on the good
ground, this is he who hears the word, and understands it, who most
certainly bears fruit, and brings forth, some one hundred times as much,
some sixty, and some thirty.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,24);</script>He set another
parable before them, saying, <span class="j">“The Kingdom of Heaven is
like a man who sowed good seed in his field, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,25);</script>but while people slept, his
enemy came and sowed <a href="#N65">darnel weeds</a> also among the wheat,
and went away. <script type="text/javascript">cj(13,26);</script>But when
the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit, then the darnel weeds
appeared also. <script type="text/javascript">cj(13,27);</script>The
servants of the householder came and said to him, ‘Sir, didn’t you sow
good seed in your field? Where did this darnel come from?’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,28);</script>“He said to them, ‘An enemy
has done this.’
</span><p><span class="j">“The servants asked him, ‘Do you want us to
go and gather them up?’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,29);</script>“But he said, ‘No, lest
perhaps while you gather up the darnel weeds, you root up the wheat with
them. <script type="text/javascript">cj(13,30);</script>Let both grow
together until the harvest, and in the harvest time I will tell the
reapers, “First, gather up the darnel weeds, and bind them in bundles to
burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.”’”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,31);</script>He set another
parable before them, saying, <span class="j">“The Kingdom of Heaven is
like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field;
<script type="text/javascript">cj(13,32);</script>which indeed is smaller
than all seeds. But when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and
becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its
branches.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,33);</script>He spoke another
parable to them. <span class="j">“The Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast,
which a woman took, and hid in three <a href="#N66">measures</a> of meal,
until it was all leavened.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,34);</script>Jesus spoke all these
things in parables to the multitudes; and without a parable, he didn’t
speak to them, <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,35);</script>that it
might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying, 
<dl>
<dt>“I will open my mouth in parables;
<dd>I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.”<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N67">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,36);</script>Then Jesus sent the
multitudes away, and went into the house. His disciples came to him,
saying, “Explain to us the parable of the darnel weeds of the field.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,37);</script>He answered them,
<span class="j">“He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,38);</script>the field is the world; and the
good seed, these are the children of the Kingdom; and the darnel weeds are
the children of the evil one. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,39);</script>The enemy who sowed them is the
devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(13,40);</script>As therefore the darnel
weeds are gathered up and burned with fire; so will it be at the end of
this age. <script type="text/javascript">cj(13,41);</script>The Son of Man
will send out his angels, and they will gather out of his Kingdom all
things that cause stumbling, and those who do iniquity, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,42);</script>and will cast them into the
furnace of fire. There will be weeping and the gnashing of teeth. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,43);</script>Then the righteous will shine
forth like the sun in the Kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to
hear, let him hear.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,44);</script>“Again, the Kingdom of Heaven
is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found, and hid. In his
joy, he goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,45);</script>“Again, the Kingdom of Heaven
is like a man who is a merchant seeking fine pearls, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,46);</script>who having found one pearl of
great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,47);</script>“Again, the Kingdom of Heaven
is like a dragnet, that was cast into the sea, and gathered some fish of
every kind, <script type="text/javascript">cj(13,48);</script>which, when
it was filled, they drew up on the beach. They sat down, and gathered the
good into containers, but the bad they threw away. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(13,49);</script>So will it be in the end of the
world. The angels will come forth, and separate the wicked from among the
righteous, <script type="text/javascript">cj(13,50);</script>and will cast
them into the furnace of fire. There will be the weeping and the gnashing
of teeth.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,51);</script>Jesus said to them, <span
class="j">“Have you understood all these things?”</span>
<p>They answered him, “Yes, Lord.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,52);</script>He said to them,
<span class="j">“Therefore every scribe who has been made a disciple in
the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a householder, who brings out
of his treasure new and old things.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,53);</script>It happened that when
Jesus had finished these parables, he departed from there. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,54);</script>Coming into his own country, he
taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said,
“Where did this man get this wisdom, and these mighty works? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,55);</script>Isn’t this the carpenter’s
son? Isn’t his mother called Mary, and his brothers, James, Joses,
Simon, and <a href="#N68">Judas</a>? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,56);</script>Aren’t all of his sisters with
us? Where then did this man get all of these things?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,57);</script>They were offended by him.
<p>But Jesus said to them, <span class="j">“A prophet is not without
honor, except in his own country, and in his own house.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,58);</script>He didn’t do many mighty works
there because of their unbelief.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,1);</script>At that time, Herod
the tetrarch heard the report concerning Jesus, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,2);</script>and said to his servants, “This
is John the Baptizer. He is risen from the dead. That is why these powers
work in him.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,3);</script>For Herod
had laid hold of John, and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake
of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,4);</script>For John said to him, “It is
not lawful for you to have her.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,5);</script>When he would have put him to
death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(14,6);</script>But when Herod’s
birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced among them and pleased
Herod. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,7);</script>Whereupon he
promised with an oath to give her whatever she should ask. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,8);</script>She, being prompted by her
mother, said, “Give me here on a platter the head of John the
Baptizer.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,9);</script>The king was grieved,
but for the sake of his oaths, and of those who sat at the table with him,
he commanded it to be given, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,10);</script>and he sent and beheaded John in
the prison. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,11);</script>His head was
brought on a platter, and given to the young lady: and she brought it to
her mother. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,12);</script>His
disciples came, and took the body, and buried it; and they went and told
Jesus. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,13);</script>Now when Jesus
heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat, to a deserted place apart.
When the multitudes heard it, they followed him on foot from the cities.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,14);</script>Jesus went out, and
he saw a great multitude. He had compassion on them, and healed their
sick. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,15);</script>When evening had
come, his disciples came to him, saying, “This place is deserted, and
the hour is already late. Send the multitudes away, that they may go into
the villages, and buy themselves food.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,16);</script>But Jesus said to
them, <span class="j">“They don’t need to go away. You give them
something to eat.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,17);</script>They told him, “We
only have here five loaves and two fish.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,18);</script>He said, <span
class="j">“Bring them here to me.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,19);</script>He commanded the multitudes to
sit down on the grass; and he took the five loaves and the two fish, and
looking up to heaven, he blessed, broke and gave the loaves to the
disciples, and the disciples gave to the multitudes. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,20);</script>They all ate, and were filled.
They took up twelve baskets full of that which remained left over from the
broken pieces. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,21);</script>Those who
ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,22);</script>Immediately Jesus
made the disciples get into the boat, and to go ahead of him to the other
side, while he sent the multitudes away. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,23);</script>After he had sent the multitudes
away, he went up into the mountain by himself to pray. When evening had
come, he was there alone. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,24);</script>But the boat was now in the
middle of the sea, distressed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(14,25);</script>In <a href="#N69">the
fourth watch of the night,</a> Jesus came to them, walking on the
sea.<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N70">*</a></sup></font>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(14,26);</script>When the disciples saw
him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, “It’s a ghost!”
and they cried out for fear. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,27);</script>But immediately Jesus spoke to
them, saying <span class="j">“Cheer up! <a href="#N71">It is I!</a>
Don’t be afraid.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,28);</script>Peter answered him
and said, “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the
waters.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,29);</script>He said, <span
class="j">“Come!”</span>
<p>Peter stepped down from the boat, and walked on the waters to come to
Jesus. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,30);</script>But when he saw
that the wind was strong, he was afraid, and beginning to sink, he cried
out, saying, “Lord, save me!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,31);</script>Immediately Jesus
stretched out his hand, took hold of him, and said to him, <span
class="j">“You of little faith, why did you doubt?”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,32);</script>When they got up into the boat,
the wind ceased. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,33);</script>Those
who were in the boat came and worshiped him, saying, “You are truly the
Son of God!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,34);</script>When they had crossed
over, they came to the land of Gennesaret. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,35);</script>When the people of that place
recognized him, they sent into all that surrounding region, and brought to
him all who were sick, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,36);</script>and they begged him that they
might just touch the <a href="#N72">fringe</a> of his garment. As many as
touched it were made whole.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,1);</script>Then Pharisees and
scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,2);</script>“Why do your disciples disobey
the tradition of the elders? For they don’t wash their hands when they
eat bread.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,3);</script>He answered them,
<span class="j">“Why do you also disobey the commandment of God because
of your tradition? <script type="text/javascript">cj(15,4);</script>For
God commanded, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N73">*</a></sup></font> and, ‘He
who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.’<font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N74">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,5);</script>But you say, ‘Whoever may tell
his father or his mother, “Whatever help you might otherwise have gotten
from me is a gift devoted to God,” <script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,6);</script>he shall not honor his father or
mother.’ You have made the commandment of God void because of your
tradition. <script type="text/javascript">cj(15,7);</script>You
hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,</span>
<dl><span class="j">
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cj(15,8);</script>‘These people draw
near to me with their mouth,
<dd>and honor me with their lips;
<dd>but their heart is far from me.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cj(15,9);</script>And in vain do they
worship me,
<dd>teaching as doctrine rules made by men.’”</span><font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N75">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,10);</script>He summoned the
multitude, and said to them, <span class="j">“Hear, and understand.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(15,11);</script>That which enters into
the mouth doesn’t defile the man; but that which proceeds out of the
mouth, this defiles the man.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,12);</script>Then the disciples
came, and said to him, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended,
when they heard this saying?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,13);</script>But he answered,
<span class="j">“Every plant which my heavenly Father didn’t plant
will be uprooted. <script type="text/javascript">cj(15,14);</script>Leave
them alone. They are blind guides of the blind. If the blind guide the
blind, both will fall into a pit.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,15);</script>Peter answered him,
“Explain the parable to us.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,16);</script>So Jesus said, <span
class="j">“Do you also still not understand? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,17);</script>Don’t you understand that
whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly, and then out of the
body? <script type="text/javascript">cj(15,18);</script>But the things
which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart, and they defile the
man. <script type="text/javascript">cj(15,19);</script>For out of the
heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual sins, thefts,
false testimony, and blasphemies. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(15,20);</script>These are the things which
defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands doesn’t defile the
man.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,21);</script>Jesus went out from
there, and withdrew into the region of Tyre and Sidon. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,22);</script>Behold, a Canaanite woman came
out from those borders, and cried, saying, “Have mercy on me, Lord, you
son of David! My daughter is severely demonized!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,23);</script>But he answered her
not a word.
<p>His disciples came and begged him, saying, “Send her away; for she
cries after us.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,24);</script>But he answered,
<span class="j">“I wasn’t sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the
house of Israel.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,25);</script>But she came and
worshiped him, saying, “Lord, help me.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,26);</script>But he answered,
<span class="j">“It is not appropriate to take the children’s bread
and throw it to the dogs.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,27);</script>But she said, “Yes,
Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters’
table.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,28);</script>Then Jesus answered
her, <span class="j">“Woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you even
as you desire.”</span> And her daughter was healed from that hour.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,29);</script>Jesus departed there,
and came near to the sea of Galilee; and he went up into the mountain, and
sat there. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,30);</script>Great
multitudes came to him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed,
and many others, and they put them down at his feet. He healed them,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(15,31);</script>so that the multitude
wondered when they saw the mute speaking, injured whole, lame walking, and
blind seeing—and they glorified the God of Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,32);</script>Jesus summoned his
disciples and said, <span class="j">“I have compassion on the multitude,
because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat. I
don’t want to send them away fasting, or they might faint on the
way.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,33);</script>The disciples said to
him, “Where should we get so many loaves in a deserted place as to
satisfy so great a multitude?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,34);</script>Jesus said to them,
<span class="j">“How many loaves do you have?”</span>
<p>They said, “Seven, and a few small fish.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,35);</script>He commanded the
multitude to sit down on the ground; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,36);</script>and he took the seven loaves and
the fish. He gave thanks and broke them, and gave to the disciples, and
the disciples to the multitudes. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,37);</script>They all ate, and were filled.
They took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(15,38);</script>Those who ate were four
thousand men, besides women and children. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,39);</script>Then he sent away the
multitudes, got into the boat, and came into the borders of Magdala.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,1);</script>The Pharisees and
Sadducees came, and testing him, asked him to show them a sign from
heaven. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,2);</script>But he answered
them, <span class="j">“When it is evening, you say, ‘It will be fair
weather, for the sky is red.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,3);</script>In the morning, ‘It will be
foul weather today, for the sky is red and threatening.’ Hypocrites! You
know how to discern the appearance of the sky, but you can’t discern the
signs of the times! <script type="text/javascript">cj(16,4);</script>An
evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and there will be no
sign given to it, except the sign of the prophet Jonah.”</span>
<p>He left them, and departed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,5);</script>The disciples came to the other
side and had forgotten to take bread. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,6);</script>Jesus said to them, <span
class="j">“Take heed and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and
Sadducees.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,7);</script>They reasoned among
themselves, saying, “We brought no bread.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,8);</script>Jesus, perceiving it,
said, <span class="j">“Why do you reason among yourselves, you of little
faith, ‘because you have brought no bread?’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,9);</script>Don’t you yet perceive, neither
remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you
took up? <script type="text/javascript">cj(16,10);</script>Nor the seven
loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you took up? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,11);</script>How is it that you don’t
perceive that I didn’t speak to you concerning bread? But beware of the
yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,12);</script>Then they understood
that he didn’t tell them to beware of the yeast of bread, but of the
teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,13);</script>Now when Jesus came into the
parts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, <span
class="j">“Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,14);</script>They said, “Some
say John the Baptizer, some, Elijah, and others, Jeremiah, or one of the
prophets.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,15);</script>He said to them,
<span class="j">“But who do you say that I am?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,16);</script>Simon Peter answered,
“You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,17);</script>Jesus answered him,
<span class="j">“Blessed are you, Simon Bar Jonah, for flesh and blood
has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,18);</script>I also tell you that you are <a
href="#N76">Peter,</a> and on this <a href="#N77">rock</a> I will build my
assembly, and the gates of <a href="#N78">Hades</a> will not prevail
against it. <script type="text/javascript">cj(16,19);</script>I will give
to you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and whatever you bind on earth
will have been bound in heaven; and whatever you release on earth will
have been released in heaven.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,20);</script>Then he commanded the disciples
that they should tell no one that he was Jesus the Christ. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,21);</script>From that time, Jesus began to
show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things
from the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and the third
day be raised up.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,22);</script>Peter took him aside,
and began to rebuke him, saying, “Far be it from you, Lord! This will
never be done to you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,23);</script>But he turned, and
said to Peter, <span class="j">“Get behind me, Satan! You are a
stumbling block to me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of
God, but on the things of men.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,24);</script>Then Jesus said to his
disciples, <span class="j">“If anyone desires to come after me, let him
deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,25);</script>For whoever desires to save his
life will lose it, and whoever will lose his life for my sake will find
it. <script type="text/javascript">cj(16,26);</script>For what will it
profit a man, if he gains the whole world, and forfeits his life? Or what
will a man give in exchange for his life? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,27);</script>For the Son of Man will come in
the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will render to
everyone according to his deeds. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(16,28);</script>Most certainly I tell you, there
are some standing here who will in no way taste of death, until they see
the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,1);</script>After six days, Jesus
took with him Peter, James, and John his brother, and brought them up into
a high mountain by themselves. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,2);</script>He was transfigured before them.
His face shone like the sun, and his garments became as white as the
light. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,3);</script>Behold, Moses and
Elijah appeared to them talking with him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,4);</script>Peter answered, and
said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you want, let’s
make three tents here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,5);</script>While he was still
speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. Behold, a voice came
out of the cloud, saying, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well
pleased. Listen to him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,6);</script>When the disciples
heard it, they fell on their faces, and were very afraid. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,7);</script>Jesus came and touched them and
said, <span class="j">“Get up, and don’t be afraid.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,8);</script>Lifting up their eyes, they saw
no one, except Jesus alone. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,9);</script>As they were coming down from the
mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, <span class="j">“Don’t tell
anyone what you saw, until the Son of Man has risen from the
dead.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,10);</script>His disciples asked
him, saying, “Then why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,11);</script>Jesus answered them,
<span class="j">“Elijah indeed comes first, and will restore all things,
<script type="text/javascript">cj(17,12);</script>but I tell you that
Elijah has come already, and they didn’t recognize him, but did to him
whatever they wanted to. Even so the Son of Man will also suffer by
them.”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,13);</script>Then the
disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the Baptizer.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,14);</script>When they came to the
multitude, a man came to him, kneeling down to him, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,15);</script>“Lord, have mercy on my son,
for he is epileptic, and suffers grievously; for he often falls into the
fire, and often into the water. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,16);</script>So I brought him to your
disciples, and they could not cure him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,17);</script>Jesus answered, <span
class="j">“Faithless and perverse generation! How long will I be with
you? How long will I bear with you? Bring him here to me.”</span>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(17,18);</script>Jesus rebuked him, the
demon went out of him, and the boy was cured from that hour.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,19);</script>Then the disciples
came to Jesus privately, and said, “Why weren’t we able to cast it
out?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,20);</script>He said to them,
<span class="j">“Because of your unbelief. For most certainly I tell
you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will tell this
mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move; and nothing
will be impossible for you. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(17,21);</script>But this kind doesn’t go out
except by prayer and fasting.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,22);</script>While they were
staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them, <span class="j">“The Son of Man
is about to be delivered up into the hands of men, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(17,23);</script>and they will kill him, and the
third day he will be raised up.”</span>
<p>They were exceedingly sorry. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,24);</script>When they had come to Capernaum,
those who collected the <a href="#N79">didrachma coins</a> came to Peter,
and said, “Doesn’t your teacher pay the didrachma?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,25);</script>He said, “Yes.”
<p>When he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, <span
class="j">“What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth
receive toll or tribute? From their children, or from strangers?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,26);</script>Peter said to him,
“From strangers.”
<p>Jesus said to him, <span class="j">“Therefore the children are
exempt. <script type="text/javascript">cj(17,27);</script>But, lest we
cause them to stumble, go to the sea, cast a hook, and take up the first
fish that comes up. When you have opened its mouth, you will find a <a
href="#N80">stater coin.</a> Take that, and give it to them for me and
you.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,1);</script>In that hour the
disciples came to Jesus, saying, “Who then is greatest in the Kingdom of
Heaven?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,2);</script>Jesus called a little
child to himself, and set him in their midst, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,3);</script>and said, <span class="j">“Most
certainly I tell you, unless you turn, and become as little children, you
will in no way enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,4);</script>Whoever therefore humbles himself
as this little child, the same is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(18,5);</script>Whoever receives one such
little child in my name receives me, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,6);</script>but whoever causes one of these
little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him that
a huge millstone should be hung around his neck, and that he should be
sunk in the depths of the sea.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,7);</script>“Woe to the world because of
occasions of stumbling! For it must be that the occasions come, but woe to
that person through whom the occasion comes! <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,8);</script>If your hand or your foot causes
you to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from you. It is better for you to
enter into life maimed or crippled, rather than having two hands or two
feet to be cast into the eternal fire. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,9);</script>If your eye causes you to
stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter
into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the <a
href="#N81">Gehenna</a> of fire. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,10);</script>See that you don’t despise one
of these little ones, for I tell you that in heaven their angels always
see the face of my Father who is in heaven. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,11);</script>For the Son of Man came to save
that which was lost.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,12);</script>“What do you think? If a man
has one hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, doesn’t he leave the
ninety-nine, go to the mountains, and seek that which has gone astray?
<script type="text/javascript">cj(18,13);</script>If he finds it, most
certainly I tell you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine
which have not gone astray. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,14);</script>Even so it is not the will of
your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,15);</script>“If your brother sins against
you, go, show him his fault between you and him alone. If he listens to
you, you have gained back your brother. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,16);</script>But if he doesn’t listen, take
one or two more with you, that at the mouth of two or three witnesses
every word may be established.<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N82">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,17);</script>If he refuses to listen to them,
tell it to the assembly. If he refuses to hear the assembly also, let him
be to you as a Gentile or a tax collector. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,18);</script>Most certainly I tell you,
whatever things you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven, and
whatever things you release on earth will have been released in heaven.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(18,19);</script>Again, assuredly I tell
you, that if two of you will agree on earth concerning anything that they
will ask, it will be done for them by my Father who is in heaven. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,20);</script>For where two or three are
gathered together in my name, there I am in their midst.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,21);</script>Then Peter came and
said to him, “Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I
forgive him? Until seven times?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,22);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“I don’t tell you until seven times, but, until
seventy times seven. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,23);</script>Therefore the Kingdom of Heaven
is like a certain king, who wanted to reconcile accounts with his
servants. <script type="text/javascript">cj(18,24);</script>When he had
begun to reconcile, one was brought to him who owed him <a href="#N83">ten
thousand talents.</a> <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,25);</script>But because he couldn’t pay,
his lord commanded him to be sold, with his wife, his children, and all
that he had, and payment to be made. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,26);</script>The servant therefore fell down
and kneeled before him, saying, ‘Lord, have patience with me, and I will
repay you all!’ <script type="text/javascript">cj(18,27);</script>The
lord of that servant, being moved with compassion, released him, and
forgave him the debt.
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,28);</script>“But that servant went out,
and found one of his fellow servants, who owed him <a href="#N84">one
hundred denarii,</a> and he grabbed him, and took him by the throat,
saying, ‘Pay me what you owe!’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,29);</script>“So his fellow servant fell
down at his feet and begged him, saying, ‘Have patience with me, and I
will repay you!’ <script type="text/javascript">cj(18,30);</script>He
would not, but went and cast him into prison, until he should pay back
that which was due. <script type="text/javascript">cj(18,31);</script>So
when his fellow servants saw what was done, they were exceedingly sorry,
and came and told to their lord all that was done. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,32);</script>Then his lord called him in, and
said to him, ‘You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt, because
you begged me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,33);</script>Shouldn’t you also have had
mercy on your fellow servant, even as I had mercy on you?’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(18,34);</script>His lord was angry, and
delivered him to the tormentors, until he should pay all that was due to
him. <script type="text/javascript">cj(18,35);</script>So my heavenly
Father will also do to you, if you don’t each forgive your brother from
your hearts for his misdeeds.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,1);</script>It happened when Jesus
had finished these words, he departed from Galilee, and came into the
borders of Judea beyond the Jordan. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,2);</script>Great multitudes followed him,
and he healed them there. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,3);</script>Pharisees came to him, testing
him, and saying, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any
reason?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,4);</script>He answered, <span
class="j">“Haven’t you read that he who made them from the beginning
made them male and female,<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N85">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cj(19,5);</script>and said, ‘For this cause a man
shall leave his father and mother, and shall join to his wife; and the two
shall become one flesh?’<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N86">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cj(19,6);</script>So that they are no more two, but
one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, don’t let man tear
apart.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,7);</script>They asked him, “Why
then did Moses command us to give her a bill of divorce, and divorce
her?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,8);</script>He said to them, <span
class="j">“Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, allowed you to
divorce your wives, but from the beginning it has not been so. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(19,9);</script>I tell you that whoever divorces
his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits
adultery; and he who marries her when she is divorced commits
adultery.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,10);</script>His disciples said to
him, “If this is the case of the man with his wife, it is not expedient
to marry.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,11);</script>But he said to them,
<span class="j">“Not all men can receive this saying, but those to whom
it is given. <script type="text/javascript">cj(19,12);</script>For there
are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother’s womb, and there
are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs who made
themselves eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven’s sake. He who is able to
receive it, let him receive it.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,13);</script>Then little children
were brought to him, that he should lay his hands on them and pray; and
the disciples rebuked them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,14);</script>But Jesus said, <span
class="j">“Allow the little children, and don’t forbid them to come to
me; for the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to ones like these.”</span>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(19,15);</script>He laid his hands on
them, and departed from there.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,16);</script>Behold, one came to
him and said, “Good teacher, what good thing shall I do, that I may have
eternal life?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,17);</script>He said to him, <span
class="j">“<a href="#N87">Why do you call me good?</a> No one is good
but one, that is, God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the
commandments.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,18);</script>He said to him,
“Which ones?”
<p>Jesus said, <span class="j">“‘You shall not murder.’ ‘You shall
not commit adultery.’ ‘You shall not steal.’ ‘You shall not offer
false testimony.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(19,19);</script>‘Honor your father and
mother.’<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N88">*</a></sup></font> And, ‘You shall love your neighbor as
yourself.’”</span><font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N89">*</a></sup></font>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,20);</script>The young man said to
him, “All these things I have observed from my youth. What do I still
lack?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,21);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have, and
give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow
me.”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,22);</script>But when
the young man heard the saying, he went away sad, for he was one who had
great possessions. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,23);</script>Jesus
said to his disciples, <span class="j">“Most certainly I say to you, a
rich man will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven with difficulty. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(19,24);</script>Again I tell you, it is easier
for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter
into the Kingdom of God.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,25);</script>When the disciples
heard it, they were exceedingly astonished, saying, “Who then can be
saved?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,26);</script>Looking at them,
Jesus said, <span class="j">“With men this is impossible, but with God
all things are possible.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,27);</script>Then Peter answered,
“Behold, we have left everything, and followed you. What then will we
have?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,28);</script>Jesus said to them,
<span class="j">“Most certainly I tell you that you who have followed
me, in the regeneration when the Son of Man will sit on the throne of his
glory, you also will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of
Israel. <script type="text/javascript">cj(19,29);</script>Everyone who has
left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or
children, or lands, for my name’s sake, will receive one hundred times,
and will inherit eternal life. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(19,30);</script>But many will be last who are
first; and first who are last.</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,1);</script><span class="j">“For
the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who was the master of a household, who
went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(20,2);</script>When he had agreed with the
laborers for a <a href="#N90">denarius</a> a day, he sent them into his
vineyard. <script type="text/javascript">cj(20,3);</script>He went out
about the <a href="#N91">third hour,</a> and saw others standing idle in
the marketplace. <script type="text/javascript">cj(20,4);</script>To them
he said, ‘You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will
give you.’ So they went their way. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(20,5);</script>Again he went out about the <a
href="#N92">sixth and the ninth hour,</a> and did likewise. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(20,6);</script>About the <a href="#N93">eleventh
hour</a> he went out, and found others standing idle. He said to them,
‘Why do you stand here all day idle?’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(20,7);</script>“They said to him, ‘Because
no one has hired us.’
</span><p><span class="j">“He said to them, ‘You also go into the
vineyard, and you will receive whatever is right.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(20,8);</script>When evening had come, the lord
of the vineyard said to his manager, ‘Call the laborers and pay them
their wages, beginning from the last to the first.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(20,9);</script>“When those who were hired at
about the eleventh hour came, they each received a denarius. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(20,10);</script>When the first came, they
supposed that they would receive more; and they likewise each received a
denarius. <script type="text/javascript">cj(20,11);</script>When they
received it, they murmured against the master of the household, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(20,12);</script>saying, ‘These last have spent
one hour, and you have made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of
the day and the scorching heat!’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(20,13);</script>“But he answered one of them,
‘Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Didn’t you agree with me for a
denarius? <script type="text/javascript">cj(20,14);</script>Take that
which is yours, and go your way. It is my desire to give to this last just
as much as to you. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(20,15);</script>Isn’t it lawful for me to do
what I want to with what I own? Or is your eye evil, because I am good?’
<script type="text/javascript">cj(20,16);</script>So the last will be
first, and the first last. For many are called, but few are
chosen.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,17);</script>As Jesus was going up
to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside, and on the way he said
to them, <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,18);</script><span
class="j">“Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will
be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him
to death, <script type="text/javascript">cj(20,19);</script>and will hand
him over to the Gentiles to mock, to scourge, and to crucify; and the
third day he will be raised up.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,20);</script>Then the mother of
the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons, kneeling and asking a
certain thing of him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,21);</script>He
said to her, <span class="j">“What do you want?”</span>
<p>She said to him, “Command that these, my two sons, may sit, one on
your right hand, and one on your left hand, in your Kingdom.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,22);</script>But Jesus answered,
<span class="j">“You don’t know what you are asking. Are you able to
drink the cup that I am about to drink, and be baptized with the baptism
that I am baptized with?”</span>
<p>They said to him, “We are able.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,23);</script>He said to them,
<span class="j">“You will indeed drink my cup, and be baptized with the
baptism that I am baptized with, but to sit on my right hand and on my
left hand is not mine to give; but it is for whom it has been prepared by
my Father.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,24);</script>When the ten heard
it, they were indignant with the two brothers.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,25);</script>But Jesus summoned
them, and said, <span class="j">“You know that the rulers of the nations
lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.
<script type="text/javascript">cj(20,26);</script>It shall not be so among
you, but whoever desires to become great among you <a href="#N94">shall
be</a> your servant. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(20,27);</script>Whoever desires to be first
among you shall be your bondservant, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(20,28);</script>even as the Son of Man came not
to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for
many.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,29);</script>As they went out from
Jericho, a great multitude followed him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,30);</script>Behold, two blind men sitting by
the road, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, “Lord,
have mercy on us, you son of David!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,31);</script>The multitude rebuked them,
telling them that they should be quiet, but they cried out even more,
“Lord, have mercy on us, you son of David!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,32);</script>Jesus stood still,
and called them, and asked, <span class="j">“What do you want me to do
for you?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,33);</script>They told him,
“Lord, that our eyes may be opened.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,34);</script>Jesus, being moved
with compassion, touched their eyes; and immediately their eyes received
their sight, and they followed him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,1);</script>When they drew near to
Jerusalem, and came to <a href="#N95">Bethsphage,</a> to the Mount of
Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,2);</script>saying to them, <span
class="j">“Go into the village that is opposite you, and immediately you
will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Untie them, and bring them
to me. <script type="text/javascript">cj(21,3);</script>If anyone says
anything to you, you shall say, ‘The Lord needs them,’ and immediately
he will send them.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,4);</script>All this was done,
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,

<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,5);</script>“Tell the daughter
of Zion,

angry, and sent his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned their

marriage feast.’ <script type="text/javascript">cj(22,10);</script>Those
servants went out into the highways, and gathered together as many as they
found, both bad and good. The wedding was filled with guests. <script

the guests, he saw there a man who didn’t have on wedding clothing,

‘Friend, how did you come in here not wearing wedding clothing?’ He
was speechless. <script type="text/javascript">cj(22,13);</script>Then the
king said to the servants, ‘Bind him hand and foot, take him away, and
throw him into the outer darkness; there is where the weeping and grinding

many are called, but few chosen.”</span>

went and took counsel how they might entrap him in his talk. <script

him, along with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are
honest, and teach the way of God in truth, no matter whom you teach, for
you aren’t partial to anyone. <script

think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?”

tax money.”</span>
<p>They brought to him a denarius.

Moses said, ‘If a man dies, having no children, his brother shall marry
his wife, and raise up seed for his brother.’ <script

therefore, whose wife will she be of the seven? For they all had her.”

them, <span class="j">“You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures, nor
the power of God. <script type="text/javascript">cj(22,30);</script>For in
the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are
like God’s angels in heaven. <script

heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, gathered themselves together.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(22,35);</script>One of them, a lawyer,
asked him a question, testing him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,36);</script>“Teacher, which is the
greatest commandment in the law?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,37);</script>Jesus said to him,

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,41);</script>Now while the
Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question, <script

do you think of the Christ? Whose son is he?”</span>
<p>They said to him, “Of David.”

<script type="text/javascript">cj(25,25);</script>I was afraid, and went
away and hid your talent in the earth. Behold, you have what is yours.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script

be gathered, and he will separate them one from another, as a shepherd

type="text/javascript">cj(25,33);</script>He will set the sheep on his
right hand, but the goats on the left. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(25,34);</script>Then the King will tell those on

me food to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave me drink. I was a stranger,
and you took me in. <script type="text/javascript">cj(25,36);</script>I

stranger, and take you in; or naked, and clothe you? <script

prison, and come to you?’
</span><p><span class="j"><script

of these my <a href="#N122">brothers</a>, you did it to me.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cj(25,41);</script>Then he will say also to those
on the left hand, ‘Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire
which is prepared for the devil and his angels; <script
type="text/javascript">cj(25,42);</script>for I was hungry, and you
didn’t give me food to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink;
<script type="text/javascript">cj(25,43);</script>I was a stranger, and
you didn’t take me in; naked, and you didn’t clothe me; sick, and in
prison, and you didn’t visit me.’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(25,44);</script>“Then they will also answer,
saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or
naked, or sick, or in prison, and didn’t help you?’
</span><p><span class="j"><script
type="text/javascript">cj(25,45);</script>“Then he will answer them,
saying, ‘Most certainly I tell you, inasmuch as you didn’t do it to
one of the least of these, you didn’t do it to me.’ <script

punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,1);</script>It happened, when
Jesus had finished all these words, that he said to his disciples, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,2);</script><span class="j">“You know that
after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be
delivered up to be crucified.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,3);</script>Then the chief
priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people were gathered together
in the court of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,4);</script>They took counsel together that
they might take Jesus by deceit, and kill him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,5);</script>But they said, “Not during the
feast, lest a riot occur among the people.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,6);</script>Now when Jesus was in
Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,7);</script>a woman came to him having an
alabaster jar of very expensive ointment, and she poured it on his head as
he sat at the table. <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,8);</script>But
when his disciples saw this, they were indignant, saying, “Why this
waste? <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,9);</script>For this ointment
might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,10);</script>However, knowing
this, Jesus said to them, <span class="j">“Why do you trouble the woman?
Because she has done a good work for me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(26,11);</script>For you always have the poor
with you; but you don’t always have me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(26,12);</script>For in pouring this ointment on
my body, she did it to prepare me for burial. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(26,13);</script>Most certainly I tell you,
wherever this Good News is preached in the whole world, what this woman
has done will also be spoken of as a memorial of her.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,14);</script>Then one of the
twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,15);</script>and said, “What are you
willing to give me, that I should deliver him to you?” They weighed out
for him thirty pieces of silver. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,16);</script>From that time he sought
opportunity to betray him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,17);</script>Now on the first day
of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying to him, “Where
do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,18);</script>He said, <span
class="j">“Go into the city to a certain person, and tell him, ‘The
Teacher says, “My time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your
house with my disciples.”’”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,19);</script>The disciples did as
Jesus commanded them, and they prepared the Passover. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,20);</script>Now when evening had come, he
was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,21);</script>As they were eating, he said,
<span class="j">“Most certainly I tell you that one of you will betray
me.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,22);</script>They were exceedingly
sorrowful, and each began to ask him, “It isn’t me, is it, Lord?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,23);</script>He answered, <span
class="j">“He who dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same will
betray me. <script type="text/javascript">cj(26,24);</script>The Son of
Man goes, even as it is written of him, but woe to that man through whom
the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not
been born.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,25);</script>Judas, who betrayed
him, answered, “It isn’t me, is it, Rabbi?”
<p>He said to him, <span class="j">“You said it.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,26);</script>As they were eating,
Jesus took bread, <a href="#N123">gave thanks for</a> it, and broke it. He
gave to the disciples, and said, <span class="j">“Take, eat; this is my
body.”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,27);</script>He took
the cup, gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, <span class="j">“All of
you drink it, <script type="text/javascript">cj(26,28);</script>for this
is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the
remission of sins. <script type="text/javascript">cj(26,29);</script>But I
tell you that I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on,
until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father’s
Kingdom.”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,30);</script>When
they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,31);</script>Then Jesus said to
them, <span class="j">“All of you will be made to stumble because of me
tonight, for it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep
of the flock will be scattered.’<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a

type="text/javascript">cj(26,32);</script>But after I am raised up, I will
go before you into Galilee.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,33);</script>But Peter answered
him, “Even if all will be made to stumble because of you, I will never
be made to stumble.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,34);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“Most certainly I tell you that tonight, before the
rooster crows, you will deny me three times.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,35);</script>Peter said to him,
“Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you.” All of the
disciples also said likewise.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,36);</script>Then Jesus came with
them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to his disciples, <span
class="j">“Sit here, while I go there and pray.”</span> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,37);</script>He took with him Peter and the
two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and severely troubled.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(26,38);</script>Then he said to them,
<span class="j">“My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay
here, and watch with me.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,39);</script>He went forward a
little, fell on his face, and prayed, saying, <span class="j">“My
Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me; nevertheless,
not what I desire, but what you desire.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,40);</script>He came to the
disciples, and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, <span
class="j">“What, couldn’t you watch with me for one hour? <script
type="text/javascript">cj(26,41);</script>Watch and pray, that you don’t
enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is
weak.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,42);</script>Again, a second time
he went away, and prayed, saying, <span class="j">“My Father, if this
cup can’t pass away from me unless I drink it, your desire be
done.”</span> <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,43);</script>He came
again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,44);</script>He left them again, went away,
and prayed a third time, saying the same words. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,45);</script>Then he came to his disciples,
and said to them, <span class="j">“Sleep on now, and take your rest.
Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands
of sinners. <script type="text/javascript">cj(26,46);</script>Arise,
let’s be going. Behold, he who betrays me is at hand.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,47);</script>While he was still
speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great
multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priest and elders of the
people. <script type="text/javascript">cb(26,48);</script>Now he who
betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, “Whoever I kiss, he is the one.
Seize him.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,49);</script>Immediately he came to Jesus,
and said, “Hail, Rabbi!” and kissed him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,50);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“Friend, why are you here?”</span> Then they came and
laid hands on Jesus, and took him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,51);</script>Behold, one of those who were
with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck the
servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,52);</script>Then Jesus said to him, <span
class="j">“Put your sword back into its place, for all those who take
the sword will die by the sword. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(26,53);</script>Or do you think that I
couldn’t ask my Father, and he would even now send me more than twelve
legions of angels? <script type="text/javascript">cj(26,54);</script>How
then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that it must be so?”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,55);</script>In that hour Jesus
said to the multitudes, <span class="j">“Have you come out as against a
robber with swords and clubs to seize me? I sat daily in the temple
teaching, and you didn’t arrest me. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(26,56);</script>But all this has happened, that
the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.”</span>
<p>Then all the disciples left him, and fled. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,57);</script>Those who had taken Jesus led
him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders
were gathered together. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,58);</script>But Peter followed him from a
distance, to the court of the high priest, and entered in and sat with the
officers, to see the end. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,59);</script>Now the chief priests, the
elders, and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus, that
they might put him to death; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,60);</script>and they found none. Even though
many false witnesses came forward, they found none. But at last two false
witnesses came forward, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,61);</script>and said, “This man said, ‘I
am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,62);</script>The high priest stood
up, and said to him, “Have you no answer? What is this that these
testify against you?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,63);</script>But Jesus held his peace. The
high priest answered him, “I adjure you by the living God, that you tell
us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,64);</script>Jesus said to him,
<span class="j">“You have said it. Nevertheless, I tell you, after this
you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming
on the clouds of the sky.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,65);</script>Then the high priest
tore his clothing, saying, “He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any
more witnesses? Behold, now you have heard his blasphemy. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,66);</script>What do you think?”
<p>They answered, “He is worthy of death!” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,67);</script>Then they spit in his face and
beat him with their fists, and some slapped him, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,68);</script>saying, “Prophesy to us, you
Christ! Who hit you?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,69);</script>Now Peter was sitting
outside in the court, and a maid came to him, saying, “You were also
with Jesus, the Galilean!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,70);</script>But he denied it
before them all, saying, “I don’t know what you are talking about.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,71);</script>When he had gone out
onto the porch, someone else saw him, and said to those who were there,
“This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,72);</script>Again he denied it
with an oath, “I don’t know the man.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,73);</script>After a little while
those who stood by came and said to Peter, “Surely you are also one of
them, for your speech makes you known.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(26,74);</script>Then he began to
curse and to swear, “I don’t know the man!”
<p>Immediately the rooster crowed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(26,75);</script>Peter remembered the word which
Jesus had said to him, “Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three
times.” He went out and wept bitterly.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,1);</script>Now when morning had
come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel
against Jesus to put him to death: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,2);</script>and they bound him, and led him
away, and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate, the governor. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,3);</script>Then Judas, who betrayed him,
when he saw that Jesus was condemned, felt remorse, and brought back the
thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,4);</script>saying, “I have sinned in that
I betrayed innocent blood.”
<p>But they said, “What is that to us? You see to it.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,5);</script>He threw down the
pieces of silver in the sanctuary, and departed. He went away and hanged
himself. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,6);</script>The chief
priests took the pieces of silver, and said, “It’s not lawful to put
them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,7);</script>They took counsel, and bought the
potter’s field with them, to bury strangers in. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,8);</script>Therefore that field was called
“The Field of Blood” to this day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,9);</script>Then that which was spoken
through <a href="#N125">Jeremiah</a> the prophet was fulfilled, saying,
<dl>
<dt>“They took the thirty pieces of silver,
<dd>the price of him upon whom a price had been set,
<dd>whom some of the children of Israel priced,
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,10);</script>and they gave them
for the potter’s field,
<dd>as the Lord commanded me.”<font color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a
href="#N126">*</a></sup></font>
</dl>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,11);</script>Now Jesus stood
before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, “Are you the
King of the Jews?”
<p>Jesus said to him, <span class="j">“So you say.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,12);</script>When he was accused
by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,13);</script>Then Pilate said to him,
“Don’t you hear how many things they testify against you?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,14);</script>He gave him no
answer, not even one word, so that the governor marveled greatly. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,15);</script>Now at the feast the governor
was accustomed to release to the multitude one prisoner, whom they
desired. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,16);</script>They had then a
notable prisoner, called Barabbas. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,17);</script>When therefore they were
gathered together, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release
to you? Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called Christ?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,18);</script>For he knew that because of envy
they had delivered him up.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,19);</script>While he was sitting
on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, “Have nothing to do
with that righteous man, for I have suffered many things this day in a
dream because of him.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,20);</script>Now the chief priests and the
elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(27,21);</script>But the governor
answered them, “Which of the two do you want me to release to you?”
<p>They said, “Barabbas!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,22);</script>Pilate said to them,
“What then shall I do to Jesus, who is called Christ?”
<p>They all said to him, “Let him be crucified!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,23);</script>But the governor
said, “Why? What evil has he done?”
<p>But they cried out exceedingly, saying, “Let him be crucified!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,24);</script>So when Pilate saw
that nothing was being gained, but rather that a disturbance was starting,
he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, “I am
innocent of the blood of this righteous person. You see to it.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,25);</script>All the people
answered, “May his blood be on us, and on our children!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,26);</script>Then he released to
them Barabbas, but Jesus he flogged and delivered to be crucified. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,27);</script>Then the governor’s soldiers
took Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered the whole garrison together
against him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,28);</script>They
stripped him, and put a scarlet robe on him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,29);</script>They braided a crown of thorns
and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled
down before him, and mocked him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(27,30);</script>They spat on him, and
took the reed and struck him on the head. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,31);</script>When they had mocked him, they
took the robe off of him, and put his clothes on him, and led him away to
crucify him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,32);</script>As they came out,
they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, and they compelled him to go
with them, that he might carry his cross. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,33);</script>They came to a place called
“Golgotha,” that is to say, “The place of a skull.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,34);</script>They gave him sour wine to drink
mixed with gall. When he had tasted it, he would not drink. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,35);</script>When they had crucified him,
they divided his clothing among them, casting lots,<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N127">*</a></sup></font> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,36);</script>and they sat and watched him
there. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,37);</script>They set up over
his head the accusation against him written, “THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF
THE JEWS.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,38);</script>Then there were two
robbers crucified with him, one on his right hand and one on the left.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(27,39);</script>Those who passed by
blasphemed him, wagging their heads, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,40);</script>and saying, “You who destroy
the temple, and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son
of God, come down from the cross!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,41);</script>Likewise the chief
priests also mocking, with the scribes, <a href="#N128">the Pharisees,</a>
and the elders, said, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,42);</script>“He saved others, but he
can’t save himself. If he is the King of Israel, let him come down from
the cross now, and we will believe in him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,43);</script>He trusts in God. Let God
deliver him now, if he wants him; for he said, ‘I am the Son of
God.’” <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,44);</script>The robbers
also who were crucified with him cast on him the same reproach.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,45);</script>Now from the <a
href="#N129">sixth hour</a> there was darkness over all the land until the
<a href="#N130">ninth hour.</a> <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,46);</script>About the ninth hour Jesus cried
with a loud voice, saying, <span class="j">“Eli, Eli, <a
href="#N131">lima</a> sabachthani?”</span> That is, <span
class="j">“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”</span><font
color="#0000ff" size=-1><sup><a href="#N132">*</a></sup></font>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,47);</script>Some of them who
stood there, when they heard it, said, “This man is calling Elijah.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,48);</script>Immediately one of
them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a
reed, and gave him a drink. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,49);</script>The rest said, “Let him be.
Let’s see whether Elijah comes to save him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,50);</script>Jesus cried again
with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,51);</script>Behold, the veil of the temple
was torn in two from the top to the bottom. The earth quaked and the rocks
were split. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,52);</script>The tombs
were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were
raised; <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,53);</script>and coming out
of the tombs after his resurrection, they entered into the holy city and
appeared to many. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,54);</script>Now
the centurion, and those who were with him watching Jesus, when they saw
the earthquake, and the things that were done, feared exceedingly, saying,
“Truly this was the Son of God.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,55);</script>Many women were there
watching from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(27,56);</script>Among them were Mary
Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons
of Zebedee. <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,57);</script>When evening
had come, a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who himself was also
Jesus’ disciple came. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,58);</script>This man went to Pilate, and
asked for Jesus’ body. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given up.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(27,59);</script>Joseph took the body,
and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,60);</script>and laid it in his own new tomb,
which he had cut out in the rock, and he rolled a great stone to the door
of the tomb, and departed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,61);</script>Mary Magdalene was there, and
the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,62);</script>Now on the next day, which was
the day after the Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees
were gathered together to Pilate, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,63);</script>saying, “Sir, we remember what
that deceiver said while he was still alive: ‘After three days I will
rise again.’ <script type="text/javascript">cb(27,64);</script>Command
therefore that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest perhaps
his disciples come at night and steal him away, and tell the people, ‘He
is risen from the dead;’ and the last deception will be worse than the
first.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(27,65);</script>Pilate said to them,
“You have a guard. Go, make it as secure as you can.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(27,66);</script>So they went with the guard and
made the tomb secure, sealing the stone.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,1);</script>Now after the Sabbath,
as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the
other Mary came to see the tomb. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,2);</script>Behold, there was a great
earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky, and came and
rolled away the stone from the door, and sat on it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,3);</script>His appearance was like
lightning, and his clothing white as snow. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,4);</script>For fear of him, the guards
shook, and became like dead men. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,5);</script>The angel answered the women,
“Don’t be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus, who has been
crucified. <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,6);</script>He is not
here, for he has risen, just like he said. Come, see the place where the
Lord was lying. <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,7);</script>Go
quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead, and behold,
he goes before you into Galilee; there you will see him.’ Behold, I have
told you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,8);</script>They departed quickly
from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples
word. <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,9);</script>As they went to
tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, <span
class="j">“Rejoice!”</span>
<p>They came and took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,10);</script>Then Jesus said to
them, <span class="j">“Don’t be afraid. Go tell my <a
href="#N133">brothers</a> that they should go into Galilee, and there they
will see me.”</span>
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,11);</script>Now while they were
going, behold, some of the guards came into the city, and told the chief
priests all the things that had happened. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,12);</script>When they were assembled with
the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave a large amount of silver to
the soldiers, <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,13);</script>saying,
“Say that his disciples came by night, and stole him away while we
slept. <script type="text/javascript">cb(28,14);</script>If this comes to
the governor’s ears, we will persuade him and make you free of worry.”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(28,15);</script>So they took the money
and did as they were told. This saying was spread abroad among the Jews,
and continues until this day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(28,16);</script>But the eleven
disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had sent them.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(28,17);</script>When they saw him, they
bowed down to him, but some doubted. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(28,18);</script>Jesus came to them and spoke to
them, saying, <span class="j">“All authority has been given to me in
heaven and on earth. <script
type="text/javascript">cj(28,19);</script>Go,<font color="#0000ff"
size=-1><sup><a href="#N134">*</a></sup></font> and make disciples of all
nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of
the Holy Spirit, <script
type="text/javascript">cj(28,20);</script>teaching them to observe all
things that I commanded you. Behold, I am with you always, even to the end
of the age.”</span> Amen.
