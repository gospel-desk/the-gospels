Proverbs
</h1><p>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,1);</script>The proverbs of Solomon,
the son of David, king of Israel:
<dl>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,2);</script>to know wisdom and
instruction;
<dd>to discern the words of understanding;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,3);</script>to receive instruction
in wise dealing,
<dd>in righteousness, justice, and equity;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,4);</script>to give prudence to
the simple,
<dd>knowledge and discretion to the young man:
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,5);</script>that the wise man may
hear, and increase in learning;
<dd>that the man of understanding may attain to sound counsel:
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,6);</script>to understand a
proverb, and parables,
<dd>the words and riddles of the wise.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,7);</script>The fear of <a
href="#N1">Yahweh</a> is the beginning of knowledge;
<dd>but the foolish despise wisdom and instruction.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,8);</script>My son, listen to your
father’s instruction,
<dd>and don’t forsake your mother’s teaching:
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,9);</script>for they will be a
garland to grace your head,
<dd>and chains around your neck.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,10);</script>My son, if sinners
entice you, don’t consent.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,11);</script>If they say, “Come
with us,
<dd>Let’s lay in wait for blood;
<dd>let’s lurk secretly for the innocent without cause;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,12);</script>let’s swallow them
up alive like <a href="#N2">Sheol</a>,
<dd>and whole, like those who go down into the pit.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,13);</script>We’ll find all
valuable wealth.
<dd>We’ll fill our houses with spoil.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,14);</script>You shall cast your
lot among us.
<dd>We’ll all have one purse.”
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,15);</script>My son, don’t walk
in the way with them.
<dd>Keep your foot from their path,
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,16);</script>for their feet run to
evil.
<dd>They hurry to shed blood.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,17);</script>For in vain is the
net spread in the sight of any bird:
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,18);</script>but these lay wait
for their own blood.
<dd>They lurk secretly for their own lives.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,19);</script>So are the ways of
everyone who is greedy for gain.
<dd>It takes away the life of its owners.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,20);</script>Wisdom calls aloud in
the street.
<dd>She utters her voice in the public squares.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,21);</script>She calls at the head
of noisy places.
<dd>At the entrance of the city gates, she utters her words:
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,22);</script>“How long, you
simple ones, will you love simplicity?
<dd>How long will mockers delight themselves in mockery,
<dd>and fools hate knowledge?
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,23);</script>Turn at my reproof.
<dd>Behold, I will pour out my spirit on you.
<dd>I will make known my words to you.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,24);</script>Because I have
called, and you have refused;
<dd>I have stretched out my hand, and no one has paid attention;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,25);</script>but you have ignored
all my counsel,
<dd>and wanted none of my reproof;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,26);</script>I also will laugh at
your disaster.
<dd>I will mock when calamity overtakes you;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,27);</script>when calamity
overtakes you like a storm,
<dd>when your disaster comes on like a whirlwind;
<dd>when distress and anguish come on you.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,28);</script>Then will they call
on me, but I will not answer.
<dd>They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,29);</script>because they hated
knowledge,
<dd>and didn’t choose the fear of Yahweh.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,30);</script>They wanted none of
my counsel.
<dd>They despised all my reproof.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,31);</script>Therefore they will
eat of the fruit of their own way,
<dd>and be filled with their own schemes.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,32);</script>For the backsliding
of the simple will kill them.
<dd>The careless ease of fools will destroy them.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,33);</script>But whoever listens
to me will dwell securely,
<dd>and will be at ease, without fear of harm.”
<dt>
</dl>
<dl><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,1);</script>My son, if you will
receive my words,
<dd>and store up my commandments within you;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,2);</script>So as to turn your ear
to wisdom,
<dd>and apply your heart to understanding;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,3);</script>Yes, if you call out
for discernment,
<dd>and lift up your voice for understanding;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,4);</script>If you seek her as
silver,
<dd>and search for her as for hidden treasures:
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,5);</script>then you will
understand the fear of Yahweh,
<dd>and find the knowledge of <a href="#N3">God</a>.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,6);</script>For Yahweh gives
wisdom.
<dd>Out of his mouth comes knowledge and understanding.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,7);</script>He lays up sound
wisdom for the upright.
<dd>He is a shield to those who walk in integrity;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,8);</script>that he may guard the
paths of justice,
<dd>and preserve the way of his saints.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,9);</script>Then you will
understand righteousness and justice,
<dd>equity and every good path.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,10);</script>For wisdom will enter
into your heart.
<dd>Knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,11);</script>Discretion will watch
over you.
<dd>Understanding will keep you,
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,12);</script>to deliver you from
the way of evil,
<dd>from the men who speak perverse things;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,13);</script>who forsake the paths
of uprightness,
<dd>to walk in the ways of darkness;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,14);</script>who rejoice to do
evil,
<dd>and delight in the perverseness of evil;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,15);</script>who are crooked in
their ways,
<dd>and wayward in their paths:
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,16);</script>To deliver you from
the strange woman,
<dd>even from the foreigner who flatters with her words;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,17);</script>who forsakes the
friend of her youth,
<dd>and forgets the covenant of her God:
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,18);</script>for her house leads
down to death,
<dd>her paths to the dead.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,19);</script>None who go to her
return again,
<dd>neither do they attain to the paths of life:
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,20);</script>that you may walk in
the way of good men,
<dd>and keep the paths of the righteous.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,21);</script>For the upright will
dwell in the land.
<dd>The perfect will remain in it.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,22);</script>But the wicked will
be cut off from the land.
<dd>The treacherous will be rooted out of it.
<dt>
</dl>
<dl><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,1);</script>My son, don’t forget
my teaching;
<dd>but let your heart keep my commandments:
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,2);</script>for length of days,
and years of life,
<dd>and peace, will they add to you.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,3);</script>Don’t let kindness
and truth forsake you.
<dd>Bind them around your neck.
<dd>Write them on the tablet of your heart.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,4);</script>So you will find favor,
<dd>and good understanding in the sight of God and man.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,5);</script>Trust in Yahweh with
all your heart,
<dd>and don’t lean on your own understanding.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,6);</script>In all your ways
acknowledge him,
<dd>and he will make your paths straight.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,7);</script>Don’t be wise in
your own eyes.
<dd>Fear Yahweh, and depart from evil.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,8);</script>It will be health to
your body,
<dd>and nourishment to your bones.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,9);</script>Honor Yahweh with your
substance,
<dd>with the first fruits of all your increase:
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,10);</script>so your barns will be
filled with plenty,
<dd>and your vats will overflow with new wine.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,11);</script>My son, don’t
despise Yahweh’s discipline,
<dd>neither be weary of his reproof:
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,12);</script>for whom Yahweh
loves, he reproves;
<dd>even as a father reproves the son in whom he delights.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,13);</script>Happy is the man who
finds wisdom,
<dd>the man who gets understanding.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,14);</script>For her good profit
is better than getting silver,
<dd>and her return is better than fine gold.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,15);</script>She is more precious
than rubies.
<dd>None of the things you can desire are to be compared to her.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,16);</script>Length of days is in
her right hand.
<dd>In her left hand are riches and honor.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,17);</script>Her ways are ways of
pleasantness.
<dd>All her paths are peace.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,18);</script>She is a tree of life
to those who lay hold of her.
<dd>Happy is everyone who retains her.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,19);</script>By wisdom Yahweh
founded the earth.
<dd>By understanding, he established the heavens.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,20);</script>By his knowledge, the
depths were broken up,
<dd>and the skies drop down the dew.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,21);</script>My son, let them not
depart from your eyes.
<dd>Keep sound wisdom and discretion:
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,22);</script>so they will be life
to your soul,
<dd>and grace for your neck.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,23);</script>Then you shall walk
in your way securely.
<dd>Your foot won’t stumble.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,24);</script>When you lie down,
you will not be afraid.
<dd>Yes, you will lie down, and your sleep will be sweet.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,25);</script>Don’t be afraid of
sudden fear,
<dd>neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it comes:
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,26);</script>for Yahweh will be
your confidence,
<dd>and will keep your foot from being taken.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,27);</script>Don’t withhold good
from those to whom it is due,
<dd>when it is in the power of your hand to do it.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,28);</script>Don’t say to your
neighbor, “Go, and come again;
<dd>tomorrow I will give it to you,”
<dd>when you have it by you.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,29);</script>Don’t devise evil
against your neighbor,
<dd>since he dwells securely by you.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,30);</script>Don’t strive with a
man without cause,
<dd>if he has done you no harm.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,31);</script>Don’t envy the man
of violence.
<dd>Choose none of his ways.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,32);</script>For the perverse is
an abomination to Yahweh,
<dd>but his friendship is with the upright.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,33);</script>Yahweh’s curse is
in the house of the wicked,
<dd>but he blesses the habitation of the righteous.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,34);</script>Surely he mocks the
mockers,
<dd>but he gives grace to the humble.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,35);</script>The wise will inherit
glory,
<dd>but shame will be the promotion of fools.
<dt>
</dl>
<dl><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,1);</script>Listen, sons, to a
father’s instruction.
<dd>Pay attention and know understanding;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,2);</script>for I give you sound
learning.
<dd>Don’t forsake my law.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,3);</script>For I was a son to my
father,
<dd>tender and an only child in the sight of my mother.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,4);</script>He taught me, and said
to me:
<dd>“Let your heart retain my words.
<dd>Keep my commandments, and live.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,5);</script>Get wisdom.
<dd>Get understanding.
<dd>Don’t forget, neither swerve from the words of my mouth.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,6);</script>Don’t forsake her,
and she will preserve you.
<dd>Love her, and she will keep you.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,7);</script>Wisdom is supreme.
<dd>Get wisdom.
<dd>Yes, though it costs all your possessions, get understanding.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,8);</script>Esteem her, and she
will exalt you.
<dd>She will bring you to honor, when you embrace her.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,9);</script>She will give to your
head a garland of grace.
<dd>She will deliver a crown of splendor to you.”
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,10);</script>Listen, my son, and
receive my sayings.
<dd>The years of your life will be many.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,11);</script>I have taught you in
the way of wisdom.
<dd>I have led you in straight paths.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,12);</script>When you go, your
steps will not be hampered.
<dd>When you run, you will not stumble.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,13);</script>Take firm hold of
instruction.
<dd>Don’t let her go.
<dd>Keep her, for she is your life.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,14);</script>Don’t enter into
the path of the wicked.
<dd>Don’t walk in the way of evil men.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,15);</script>Avoid it, and don’t
pass by it.
<dd>Turn from it, and pass on.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,16);</script>For they don’t
sleep, unless they do evil.
<dd>Their sleep is taken away, unless they make someone fall.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,17);</script>For they eat the
bread of wickedness,
<dd>and drink the wine of violence.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,18);</script>But the path of the
righteous is like the dawning light,
<dd>that shines more and more until the perfect day.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,19);</script>The way of the wicked
is like darkness.
<dd>They don’t know what they stumble over.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,20);</script>My son, attend to my
words.
<dd>Turn your ear to my sayings.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,21);</script>Let them not depart
from your eyes.
<dd>Keep them in the midst of your heart.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,22);</script>For they are life to
those who find them,
<dd>and health to their whole body.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,23);</script>Keep your heart with
all diligence,
<dd>for out of it is the wellspring of life.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,24);</script>Put away from
yourself a perverse mouth.
<dd>Put corrupt lips far from you.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,25);</script>Let your eyes look
straight ahead.
<dd>Fix your gaze directly before you.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,26);</script>Make the path of your
feet level.
<dd>Let all of your ways be established.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,27);</script>Don’t turn to the
right hand nor to the left.
<dd>Remove your foot from evil.
<dt>
</dl>
<dl><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,1);</script>My son, pay attention
to my wisdom.
<dd>Turn your ear to my understanding:
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,2);</script>that you may maintain
discretion,
<dd>that your lips may preserve knowledge.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,3);</script>For the lips of an
adulteress drip honey.
<dd>Her mouth is smoother than oil,
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,4);</script>But in the end she is
as bitter as wormwood,
<dd>and as sharp as a two-edged sword.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,5);</script>Her feet go down to
death.
<dd>Her steps lead straight to <a href="#N4">Sheol</a>.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,6);</script>She gives no thought
to the way of life.
<dd>Her ways are crooked, and she doesn’t know it.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,7);</script>Now therefore, my
sons, listen to me.
<dd>Don’t depart from the words of my mouth.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,8);</script>Remove your way far
from her.
<dd>Don’t come near the door of her house,
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,9);</script>lest you give your
honor to others,
<dd>and your years to the cruel one;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,10);</script>lest strangers feast
on your wealth,
<dd>and your labors enrich another man’s house.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,11);</script>You will groan at
your latter end,
<dd>when your flesh and your body are consumed,
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,12);</script>and say, “How I
have hated instruction,
<dd>and my heart despised reproof;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,13);</script>neither have I obeyed
the voice of my teachers,
<dd>nor turned my ear to those who instructed me!
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,14);</script>I have come to the
brink of utter ruin,
<dd>in the midst of the gathered assembly.”
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,15);</script>Drink water out of
your own cistern,
<dd>running water out of your own well.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,16);</script>Should your springs
overflow in the streets,
<dd>streams of water in the public squares?
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,17);</script>Let them be for
yourself alone,
<dd>not for strangers with you.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,18);</script>Let your spring be
blessed.
<dd>Rejoice in the wife of your youth.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,19);</script>A loving doe and a
graceful deer—
<dd>let her breasts satisfy you at all times.
<dd>Be captivated always with her love.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,20);</script>For why should you,
my son, be captivated with an adulteress?
<dd>Why embrace the bosom of another?
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,21);</script>For the ways of man
are before the eyes of Yahweh.
<dd>He examines all his paths.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,22);</script>The evil deeds of the
wicked ensnare him.
<dd>The cords of his sin hold him firmly.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,23);</script>He will die for lack
of instruction.
<dd>In the greatness of his folly, he will go astray.
<dt>
</dl>
<dl><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,1);</script>My son, if you have
become collateral for your neighbor,
<dd>if you have struck your hands in pledge for a stranger;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,2);</script>You are trapped by the
words of your mouth.
<dd>You are ensnared with the words of your mouth.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,3);</script>Do this now, my son,
and deliver yourself,
<dd>since you have come into the hand of your neighbor.
<dt>Go, humble yourself.
<dd>Press your plea with your neighbor.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,4);</script>Give no sleep to your
eyes,
<dd>nor slumber to your eyelids.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,5);</script>Free yourself, like a
gazelle from the hand of the hunter,
<dd>like a bird from the snare of the fowler.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,6);</script>Go to the ant, you
sluggard.
<dd>Consider her ways, and be wise;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,7);</script>which having no chief,
overseer, or ruler,
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,8);</script>provides her bread in
the summer,
<dd>and gathers her food in the harvest.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,9);</script>How long will you
sleep, sluggard?
<dd>When will you arise out of your sleep?
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,10);</script>A little sleep, a
little slumber,
<dd>a little folding of the hands to sleep:
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,11);</script>so your poverty will
come as a robber,
<dd>and your scarcity as an armed man.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,12);</script>A worthless person, a
man of iniquity,
<dd>is he who walks with a perverse mouth;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,13);</script>who winks with his
eyes, who signals with his feet,
<dd>who motions with his fingers;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,14);</script>in whose heart is
perverseness,
<dd>who devises evil continually,
<dd>who always sows discord.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,15);</script>Therefore his
calamity will come suddenly.
<dd>He will be broken suddenly, and that without remedy.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,16);</script>There are six things
which Yahweh hates;
<dd>yes, seven which are an abomination to him:
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,17);</script>haughty eyes, a lying
tongue,
<dd>hands that shed innocent blood;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,18);</script>a heart that devises
wicked schemes,
<dd>feet that are swift in running to mischief,
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,19);</script>a false witness who
utters lies,
<dd>and he who sows discord among brothers.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,20);</script>My son, keep your

<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,20);</script>“So is the way of
an adulterous woman:

<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,21);</script>“For three things
the earth tremble,

he is king;
<dd>a fool when he is filled with food;

when she is married;

<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,24);</script>“There are four
things which are little on the earth,

strong people,
<dd>yet they provide their food in the summer.

king,

lizard with your hands,
<dd>yet it is in kings’ palaces.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,29);</script>“There are three
things which are stately in their march,
<dd>four which are stately in going:
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,30);</script>The lion, which is
mightiest among animals,
<dd>and doesn’t turn away for any;
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,31);</script>the greyhound,
<dd>the male goat also;
<dd>and the king against whom there is no rising up.
<dt>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,32);</script>“If you have done
foolishly in lifting up yourself,
<dd>or if you have thought evil,
<dt>put your hand over your mouth.
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(30,33);</script>For as the churning
of milk brings forth butter,
<dd>and the wringing of the nose brings forth blood;

<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(31,1);</script>The words of king
Lemuel; the oracle which his mother taught him.

strength to women,

forget the law,

him who is ready to perish;
