The Psalms

BOOK I
<p>
<H2>Psalm 1</H2>

<p>
<dl>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,1);</script>Blessed is the man who
doesn’t walk in the counsel of the wicked,
<dd>nor stand in the way of sinners,
<dd>nor sit in the seat of scoffers;
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,2);</script>but his delight is in
<a href="#N1">Yahweh’s</a> law.
<dd>On his law he meditates day and night.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,3);</script>He will be like a tree
planted by the streams of water,
<dd>that brings forth its fruit in its season,
<dd>whose leaf also does not wither.
<dd>Whatever he does shall prosper.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,4);</script>The wicked are not so,
<dd>but are like the chaff which the wind drives away.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,5);</script>Therefore the wicked
shall not stand in the judgment,
<dd>nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,6);</script>For Yahweh knows the
way of the righteous,
<dd>but the way of the wicked shall perish.
</dl>
<p>
<H2>Psalm 2</H2>

<p>
<dl>
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,1);</script>Why do the nations
rage,
<dd>and the peoples plot a vain thing?
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,2);</script>The kings of the earth
take a stand,
<dd>and the rulers take counsel together,
<dd>against Yahweh, and against his <a href="#N2">Anointed,</a> saying,
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,3);</script>“Let’s break their
bonds apart,
<dd>and cast their cords from us.”
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,4);</script>He who sits in the
heavens will laugh.
<dd>The <a href="#N3">Lord</a> will have them in derision.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,5);</script>Then he will speak to
them in his anger,
<dd>and terrify them in his wrath:
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,6);</script>“Yet I have set my
King on my holy hill of Zion.”
<dd><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,7);</script>I will tell of the
decree.
<dt>Yahweh said to me, “You are my son.
<dd>Today I have become your father.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,8);</script>Ask of me, and I will
give the nations for your inheritance,
<dd>the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,9);</script>You shall break them
with a rod of iron.
<dd>You shall dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.”
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,10);</script>Now therefore be
wise, you kings.
<dd>Be instructed, you judges of the earth.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,11);</script>Serve Yahweh with
fear,
<dd>and rejoice with trembling.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,12);</script><a href="#N4">Give
sincere homage to the Son</a>, lest he be angry, and you perish in the way,
<dd>for his wrath will soon be kindled.

my voice,

Yahweh.

show us any good?”
<dd>Yahweh, let the light of your face shine on us.
<dt><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,7);</script>You have put gladness
in my heart,

stand in your sight.
<dd>You hate all workers of iniquity.
